        "article_text": "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.\nUK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.\nThe MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.\nAsked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.\nThe Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.\nThe rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.\nThe inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.\nBBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.\nThe MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.\nThe confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.\nThe Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: \"There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.\"\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?\nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.\nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\nSignal: 0044 7714 956 936\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

        "article_text": "Robert Pattinson stars as multiple clones in the South Korean film-maker's big-budget follow up to Parasite \u2013 and while the star himself is entertaining, the film as a whole is a mess.\nNo best picture winner at the Oscars has been as exciting in recent years as Bong Joon Ho's Parasite \u2013 and not just because it was the first ever victor not in the English language. A scabrous takedown of the complacency of the rich, it was subversive in the way few awards players truly are, while its celebration within the gilded denizens of Hollywood added an extra layer of irony. \nFor fans of the South Korean film-maker, the good news is that despite his added commercial stock, his long-awaited follow-up is no less mischievous: a large-scale sci-fi filled with Hollywood stars and big themes it may be, but it mostly eschews the grandiose self-importance typical of such an endeavour. The bad news \u2013 and possibly an explanation for its delays in release \u2013 is that it doesn't really know what approach it wants to take instead.\u00a0All in all, it must be considered a serious disappointment from the director.\nAt least Robert Pattinson fans will be happy to get multiple (well, mostly two) versions of the actor for the price of one. He plays Mickey Barnes, a down-on-his-luck guy in a dystopian near-future, where floods of citizens are desperate to leave Earth, who signs up to a space colony program as an \"expendable\" \u2013 that is, a guinea pig worker who can be deployed in various perilous experiments for the benefit of humanity, only to be \"reprinted\" every time he inevitably dies, as a new cloned version of himself. Which is all well and good, until version number 17 of him unexpectedly survives after falling down an ice shaft on the planet Niflheim \u2013 and finds Mickey number 18 already installed in his living quarters. The question is: how do two versions of the same person learn to get along \u2013 or not?\nThe \"reprinting\" or human cloning premise is certainly one that should have plenty of narrative potential. It could be a rich source of philosophical inquiry, given what it raises about the nature of the self, death, and more besides. It could also, of course, be the basis for some decent satire, casting as it does its \"expendables\" scheme as the logical endpoint for a society that desires to exploit people without consequences. Yet on the former front, the film seems peculiarly uninterested in dealing with the questions it throws up, while in the latter respect, the comedy is so broad as to be completely toothless.\nMore like this:\n \u202210 of the best films to watch this February \n \u2022 Six ways the Berlin Film Festival will make waves\n \u2022 Why 'category fraud' is causing Oscars anger\nThe colony is run by Mark Ruffalo as a veneer-toothed, bouffant-haired, callous showman \u2013 and it's a groaningly obvious performance, from start to finish; just as tiresome is Toni Collette as his equally despotic wife, flashing a Cheshire Cat-sized grin of insincerity throughout. The brilliance of Parasite lay in how it took apart the superficial \"niceness\" of its privileged characters: here, however, they are so obviously and uninterestingly awful \u2013 characterisations worthy of a bad Saturday Night Live skit \u2013 that the effect is to defang the story of any genuine bite. That might be forgivable if the film was at least funny \u2013 but again and again lines and scenes strain for comic effect, but fail to deliver the goods.\nMickey 17\nDirector: Bong Joon Ho\nCast: Robert Pattinson, Naomi Ackie, Mark Ruffalo, Toni Collette\nRun-time: 2hr 17m\nSome of the actors fare better with the material: as Mickey's lover Nasha, Naomi Ackie is enjoyably sweary and makes the most of a rousing anti-authoritarian speech, while Pattinson has fun with the antagonism between Mickey 17, a nebbish type with a touch of Steve Buscemi, and the surly, more rebellious Mickey 18. But then that, too, becomes sidelined as the pair put their animosity aside and join forces for an epic action climax, involving them meeting the planet's native cockroach race the Creepers \u2013 think Dune's gapingly-mouthed Sandworms with legs. Suddenly, Bong does indeed go for a conventional blockbuster earnestness he has hitherto rejected \u2013 and fails to make that fit too;\u00a0like its hero, this is a film with a major identity crisis. \nWith a reported budget of $150m, it would certainly be a surprise if this curio can find the kind of audience it needs to succeed. In these risk-averse times, it's good to see an expensive studio film that is at least deeply idiosyncratic \u2013 but you have to hope such a folly doesn't make the money men even more cautious in future. \n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday. \nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A lawsuit against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Jay-Z, which alleged the rape of a 13-year-old girl in 2000, has been dismissed, according to a legal filing submitted on Friday in New York.\nThe attorney representing the anonymous plaintiff, referred to as Jane Doe, voluntarily withdrew the case, court records show.\nThe filing was submitted by lawyer Tony Buzbee, who is representing dozens of plaintiffs in lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct against Mr Combs.\nThe filings states that the plaintiff \"hereby gives notice that the... action is voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice\". \nBecause the dismissal is with prejudice, the lawsuit cannot again be refiled in its current form.\nRoc Nation, the entertainment company founded by Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, issued a statement signed by him, referring to the dismissal as a \"victory\".\n\"The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed,\" he wrote.\n\"This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims.\"\n\"The trauma that my wife, my children, loved ones and I have endured can never be dismissed,\" said the rapper, who is married to singer Beyonc\u00e9.\nHe continued: \"The courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence. May the truth prevail for all victims and those falsely accused equally.\"\nJay-Z's attorney, Alex Spiro, emphasised in a separate statement that the case \"never should have been brought\".\n\"By standing up in the face of heinous and false allegations, Jay has done what few can \u2013 he pushed back, he never settled, he never paid 1 red penny, he triumphed and cleared his name,\" he said in a statement to the BBC.\nJane Doe initially filed the lawsuit against Mr Combs in October before adding Jay-Z's name in December. She alleged that both men assaulted her in 2000 after an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty.\nJay-Z strongly denied the allegations, claiming that his attorney had been sent \"blackmail\" in an attempt to force a settlement. He said the attempt had the \"opposite effect\" and instead motivated him to publicly challenge the accusations.\nIn December, Jane Doe gave an interview that raised questions about her credibility. She admitted that \"not all the facts are clear\" and stated, \"I have made some mistakes. I may have made a mistake in identifying.\"\nLast month, Jay-Z formally requested the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing inconsistencies in the accuser's account. The request was approved by United States District Judge Analisa Torres, leading to the lawsuit's dismissal.\nWhile Jay-Z is no longer facing legal action in this case, Mr Combs continues to battle over three dozen civil suits.\nIn response to Friday's dismissal, Mr Combs' legal team issued a statement declaring his innocence.\n\"For months, we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity, pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit.

        "article_text": "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"\nIf you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.\nContestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.\nIn Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.\nForced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules. \nBlind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky. \nA second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.\n\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February. \n\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"\nYet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.\n\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.\n\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"\nThe magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.\nGonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".\n\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.\nThe Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.\nSeeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.\n\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.\n\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"\nAlongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.\nA curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media. \nA previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.\nAfter Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\". \nWhen asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".\nLike Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.\nA heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints. \nDespite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.\n\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"\nTemptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.\nTake Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.\nSo is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain? \nWhen I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.\n\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.\nIn the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.\nWhen I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.\nMontoya received particular support after his beach escapade. \n\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.\nLooking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month. \nGonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\"",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim was appointed Manchester United manager in November \nWhen Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag in October, they were 14th in the Premier League table and seven points from both the top four and the bottom three. \nFast forward three and a half months and the club are 15th, 15 points from the top four and 12 points above the relegation zone after suffering a 1-0 defeat by Tottenham - the eighth league defeat under new manager Ruben Amorim.\nThere has been no 'new manager bounce' with Portuguese coach Amorim saying he has \"a lot of problems\" and his job is \"so hard\".\nIt is no secret that United are enduring a historically poor Premier League campaign but just how large are the problems facing Amorim? \nAmorim may have jumped the gun when he described this side as \"the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United\" in January. \nAfter all, the club were relegated from the first division in 1974.\nBut in the Premier League era, they are the worst statistically at this stage of a season. \nUnited's tally of 29 points from 25 matches is their lowest at this stage of a Premier League season\nUnited have lost 12 times in 25 matches, a loss rate of 48%. \nThe club are averaging 1.16 points-per-game, which, if continued, would give them an end-of-season points tally of 44 points from 38 matches. That would be their lowest Premier League points tally. \nUnited have won four, drawn two and lost eight of Amorim's 14 Premier League matches. \nOnly Tottenham, Wolves, Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton have earned fewer points than United's 14 in their 14 Premier League matches under Amorim. \nAmorim has managed 21 matches since joining United. He has won nine, drawn three and lost nine of those matches, giving him a win rate of 43%.\nThat is the lowest of any permanent Manchester United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 over their first 21 matches in charge, with Louis van Gaal (48%) the next lowest. \nJose Mourinho (52%), David Moyes (57%), Erik ten Hag (67%) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (71%) all had significantly better records in all competitions from their first 21 matches in charge. \nThis video can not be played\nAmorim 'not worried' about mounting pressure following Spurs defeat\nOf all of United's problems under Amorim, their inability to score enough goals is the most glaring. \nA deeper look at the numbers does not make for happy reading. \nUnited have scored 28 goals in 25 Premier League matches this season - a rate of 1.12 goals-per-game.\nOnly four teams in the division - Ipswich, Southampton, Leicester and Everton - have scored fewer.\nAmad Diallo, who has been ruled out of the remainder of the season with an ankle injury, is the side's top scorer in the Premier League (six) and all competitions (nine), while centre forwards Rasmus Hojlund (two) and Joshua Zirzkee (three) have managed just five goals in 45 Premier League appearances between them.\nIn 14 matches under Ten Hag this season, United's Expected-Goals-per-game (xG) was 1.7. This has fallen slightly under Amorim, with United's xG 1.6-per-game since he took charge.\nUnited's 'big chances' created record is identical under Ten Hag and Amorim this season, with the side creating 2.9 big chances each match.\nDespite United's struggles, captain Bruno Fernandes is fourth highest for chances created in the league (53). Cole Palmer (66) is top.\nUnited finished last season with a goal difference of -1, the first time they had ended a Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference. However, they are on course to eclipse that with a -7 goal difference this term. \nSimilarly, while the 57 goals they scored during the 2023-24 campaign was their joint-lowest in the Premier League, they are on course to score fewer this season. If they maintain their rate of 1.12 goals per game, they would finish with 44 scored.\nDuring the early weeks of Amorim's reign, the former Sporting boss bemoaned the lack of time he had been to spend with his players on the training ground.\nHowever with a less packed schedule with qualification for the Europa League knockout stages assured and a Carabao Cup exit at Tottenham's hands, Amorim has been able to spend more time on the training ground.\nBut a \"free week\" before Sunday's trip to Tottenham proved anything but productive.\nBetween the 2-1 win against Leicester City in the FA Cup on 7 February and Sunday's loss to Spurs, United lost six players.\nDiallo, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Toby Collyer were ruled out of the trip through injury, while Leny Yoro and Christian Eriksen fell ill.\nTheir absences added to the long-term casualties of Luke Shaw, Mason Mount, Lisandro Martinez and Jonny Evans. \nIt meant Amorim was forced to name an inexperienced bench against Spurs with Victor Lindelof joined by Elyh Harrison, Harry Amass, Tyler Fredricson, Jack Fletcher, Jack Moorhouse, Chido Obi, Ayden Heaven and Sekou Kone. \nSweden defender Lindelof was the only one of those to have previously played for the first team. \n\nManchester United made two signings in the January window, bringing in Patrick Dorgu from Italian club Lecce and defender Ayden Heaven from Arsenal but the squad was thinner by the end of the window than when it started as Marcus Rashford, Antony and Tyrell Malacia departed on loan.\nDorgu, a multi-functional left-footed Denmark international, should provide balance at wing-back to Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\nBut the decision to allow both Antony and Rashford to leave without signing a replacement looked risky at the time and is proving so now. \nTheir departures left Hojlund, Zirzkee, Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho as the side's only recognised forwards. That list is down to three now, given Diallo's season-ending injury.\nGarnacho has no Premier League goals or assists since Amorim joined.\nRashford has made two eye-catching substitute appearances for Aston Villa since moving to Birmingham, and he played a hand in Ollie Watkins' equaliser against Ipswich on Saturday.\nAs for Antony, the Brazilian has scored three times in four matches for Real Betis since moving to Spain. This matches the tally he managed during 38 appearances for United last season and means he has scored more so far in February than United have.\n'My job is so hard' - Amorim frustrated as Man Utd lose again\nChido Obi: The 'special' Man Utd academy striker makes debut\nMan Utd under 'pressure' & must sell to buy in summer - Amorim",

        "article_text": "Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents.\nThe choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; \u00a3105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad.\n\"I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,\" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. \"But I've ended up with a bounty!\"\nChloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago.\nIn 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels.\nHer protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the caf\u00e9 in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest.\nHong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her \u2013 in which she is aged 11.\n\"It freaked me out at first,\" she says, but then she fired back a public response.\n\"I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them.\"\nChloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997.\n\"Politics were never in my life before\u2026 so I went to the first protest with curiosity,\" she said.\nShe saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck.\n\"I was so shocked,\" she says. \"That moment actually changed how I looked at the world.\"\nGrowing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms \u2013 she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about \"what we like and don't like\" and  \"could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like\".\nBut the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge.\n\"I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],\" she says. But when things started to get \"really crazy\",  she browbeat her parents into coming with her.\nAt the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the \"raw experience\", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV.\nAfter months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. Suddenly, most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies \u2013 were gone.\nSymbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail.\nIn response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown.\nAt first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around.\nUnable to afford international student fees of more than \u00a320,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO.\nWhen China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target.\nHer inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas.\nThe bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK, she says.\nChina has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week. \nAnother Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors.\nAnd last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances.\n\"They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,\" Chloe says.\nShe says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong.\n\"Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,\" she says. \"It's sad but we can't blame them.\"\nOn the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate \"any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas\". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK.\nBut more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster.\nIn the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: \"We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK.\" \nBut she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers.\n\"We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China.\"\nDoes she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says. \n\"When I think of what [they] face\u2026 it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas.\"\nBounty targets",

It's a difficult one.\"\nSinner was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol in March.\nWada had been seeking a ban of up to two years, having launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) following the 2024 decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to suspend Sinner.\nHowever, it reached a deal after accepting the player was inadvertently contaminated by a banned substance and \"did not intend to cheat\".\nWorld number 766 Broady said he was a \"little bit upset at the verdict\", adding that \"it doesn't seem like there's much being lost from this ban\".\n\"It does appear to be favouritism towards the better players on the tour,\" Broady added.\n\"I wouldn't say that he's done it on purpose, but if that had happened to another player, would we be treated the same way? Would we be afforded the same sort of dignity?\"\nJannik Sinner has been world number one since June 2024\nBroady is the latest player to question Sinner's ability to navigate the system by employing a high-powered legal team.\n\"This is how the system is supposed to work, but obviously he has a multi-million pound lawyer team to exploit that and to make the system work correctly, whereas the rest of us don't,\" Broady said.\n\"In tennis, we're all sort of self-employed and a lot of us don't make millions of pounds a year to be able to fight this sort of stuff. \n\"I would like to see, I don't know if it's even possible, the ATP to provide legal teams for everybody, good legal teams, that everybody has to use, be that Jannik, be that Tara Moore when she was banned or Mikael Ymer when he got banned.\n\"Everybody has the same legal team - money shouldn't come into it.\"\nBritain's Moore was suspended under anti-doping rules in June 2022 but had that ban overturned in December 2023.\nSweden's Ymer was banned for 18 months because of an anti-doping rule violation.\n\"I don't like how the finances have maybe affected the outcome of this compared to other cases,\" Broady added.\nDaniil Medvedev, who won the US Open in 2021, said it's a \"bad sign\" if other players are not afforded the chance to have strong legal representation.\nThe Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has launched a new scheme to help players facing allegations of doping or corruption to access pro bono legal support in an attempt to ensure access to \"world-class legal expertise regardless of a player's financial standing and personal resources\".\nNovak Djokovic believes now is the time to make changes to an \"unfair\" anti-doping system.\n\"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers,\" Djokovic said at the Qatar Open in Doha.\n\"Right now it's a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn't work [for] anti-doping, it's obvious.\n\"The problem is that right now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, towards Wada and ITIA, and the whole process.\n\"I hope that in the next period of the near future that the governing bodies are going to come together, of our tours and the tennis ecosystem, and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes.\n\"It's inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair.\"\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "With two major musicals in the awards race this year, it was only right that host David Tennant opened the Bafta Film Awards with a tune of his own. \nThe Scottish star kicked off proceedings with a storming rendition of The Proclaimers' 500 Miles, featuring contributions from Selena Gomez, Colman Domingo, Anna Kendrick, Hugh Grant and Camila Cabello.\nThe energy remained high throughout the ceremony, which saw Conclave and The Brutalist take the most prizes with four each. \nBackstage, the stars were in equally good spirits, even if a few of them were jet-lagged, hungry, and remarking on how heavy the Bafta trophy is to carry around.\nHere are eight highlights from the winners' room:\nWhen Anora star Mikey Madison collected the best actress award, she started by admitting to the audience that she hadn't prepared a speech.\nBackstage, she jokingly blamed this on Robert De Niro, whom she recently appeared with on The Graham Norton Show. \n\"I just wish that I'd had a better speech,\" she said.\n\"I was on a talk show and Robert De Niro told me not to write a speech and I thought, I should probably listen to him. And I forgot to thank so many important people.\"\nMadison was overwhelmed but overjoyed with the recognition from Bafta.\n\"I think I'm a little disassociated right now,\" she says, \"I love making movies, and being an actress is my dream, and for my film to be recognised like this is incredibly special.\n\"I don't know if I'll ever fully grasp the magnitude of being in a room like that, full of my idols, incredible creatives who I admire so much.\"\nWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl won two prizes for its producer Richard Beek and directors Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham. The trio brought their famous characters along with them to the ceremony.\nCrossingham reflected on the fact that stories about a cheese enthusiast and his loyal but long-suffering dog always seem to go down so well in the US, despite the films firmly rooted in UK culture.\n\"It is remarkable that our very Britishness is embraced in America,\" he told journalists.\nHe highlighted one particular reference in Vengeance Most Fowl: the TV presenter in the film is called Anton Deck, a reference to Geordie duo Ant & Dec.\n\"There are some jokes, like Anton Deck, which are very British. In the American screenings, there was complete silence apart from one Brit guffawing in the corner.\n\"But we're very proud of that, we stick to our guns. Apart from one or two very specific gags like that, it seems to be embraced.\n\"And even if they're laughing at us, not with us, if they're laughing, we're still happy about that.\"\nJesse Eisenberg, who won best original screenplay for A Real Pain, walked into the winners' room carrying his Bafta and asking journalists: \"Am I expected to hold this heavy thing the whole time?\"\nAfter being reassured he was allowed to put it down as he answered questions, he reflected on the fact that the screenwriting prizes he's won for A Real Pain have both been in the UK.\n\"The other award I won for this was the London Film Critics prize, so I must be living in the wrong country,\" he joked.\n\"My background is as a playwright, and when one of my plays transferred to the West End it was far more popular. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm a novelty here and in America I'm boring.\"\nEisenberg was also asked about his relationship with co-star Kieran Culkin, who won best supporting actor. But, he said, it's not as close as people might imagine.\n\"In terms of our dynamic, I'll text him today and say, 'hey you won the Bafta, I'm so proud of you'. And then three weeks later my phone will buzz and it'll be [Culkin saying]: 'Hey, I just got this, thanks'.\"\n\"That's the closeness with which you imagine we live.\"\nZoe Salda\u00f1a continued her awards season sweep of the best supporting actress category with another win at Bafta, despite the recent controversies faced by her film Emilia P\u00e9rez.\nBackstage, she reflected on her biggest number in the Spanish-language musical, El Mal, which is also up for best original song at the Oscars. \n\"Not getting in my own way was the challenge,\" she said of shooting it. \"Sometimes you can become very heady about something and you overthink it.\n\"What you have to do is trust the process... Rehearsing the dance was about reconnecting with a part of me I had missed so much but I had since let go of for more than 20 years.\n\"Reconnecting with that, dusting off all those cobwebs and jumping into the unknown was what needed to happen.\"\nAsked about the importance of performing the musical in Spanish, she replies: \"It's my first language, I was spoken to first, sung to first, in Spanish.\n\"We love we live, we fight, we work, in Spanish. And my art has [previously] only lived in a very English way. So that yearning to connect my culture with my art was meaningful to me.\"\nWarwick Davis was the recipient of this year's Bafta Fellowship, the British Academy's highest honour.\n\"It's very overwhelming, this whole thing,\" he said. \"You win the award and then you have to talk to loads of people, feeling very shiny.\" \n(Everyone was feeling sweaty backstage by this point.)\nAsked about the moment he heard he was this year's winner, Davis said: \"I was on the toilet when I found out!\n\"[Bafta] notified me by email, and I do most of my administration work on the toilet. I might call it paperwork but then you'd get the wrong idea,\" he jokes.\n\"Then I got an email from Bafta saying I'd won the fellowship, and I got all excited, and then it suddenly dawned on me, is this a fake email? Some sort of scam?\n\"So I clicked on the email address, and it really was Bafta. Then I finished up at the loo, you probably didn't need that detail, and then went and celebrated with the kids.\"\nAdrien Brody's reaction to winning best actor might have been slightly hampered by how hungry he is. \n\"I haven't eaten anything yet, so I'm not sure how I'm feeling, but I'm so happy to be here,\" he says backstage.\nBrody is asked about the surge his career has enjoyed in recent months thanks to The Brutalist, more than two decades after his last awards run for The Pianist.\n\"The beauty of being an actor is that any life experience, and there have been many since [The Pianist], anything you've experienced is so valuable in shaping a sense of understanding,\" he reflects.\n\"So the moments of triumph, loss, complexity along your path, they give you an ability to represent those more truthfully and authentically in your work.\n\"I'm just so grateful to have had this meaningful opportunity come my way, I've been yearning for this for a long time.\n\"I've been working very hard. It's not for a lack of hard work, but there are so many magical things that have to happen for a film to achieve greatness and I'm so happy that all of those things conspired on The Brutalist.\"\nAnd with that, he's off to have some supper.\nConclave won best film and best British film, becoming the first movie to take the top two prizes since 1917 (the film, not the year).\n\"I am so humbled and so grateful to be welcomed here so openly with such warmth and open arms,\" its German director Edward Berger says of the UK. \"Basically, I just want to live here, I'm never going to leave.\"\nHe likens the cast of Pope drama Conclave, which includes Stanley Tucci, Ralph Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini, to an orchestra.\n\"No-one really knows [why a cast works so well], but you have a hunch, so there's a lot of discussion - we put pictures up on the wall and it just felt like a good combination,\" he explained.\n\"They were all believable cardinals, all different nationalities and accents, it just felt they were all different instruments in a big musical piece.\"\nThe Brutalist's Brady Corbet might have won best director, but he said he was slightly too \"jet-lagged and exhausted\" to fully process it. \nAs much as he's enjoying awards season, he notes: \"It'll be amazing when it's done, I'm looking forward to getting back to work.\"\nCorbet is not shy of hard work - making the Brutalist was famously a labour of love which took several years. \"We basically just didn't sleep,\" he says. \"I haven't had a day off in years.\"\nNow that awards campaigning is in its final phase however, with voting for the Oscars closing on Monday, he should finally get some down time. \"The week leading up to the Oscars is actually pretty quiet, I'm looking forward to it.\"\nThe Brutalist, a 3.5-hour film with an intermission, has been a relative box office success despite its intimidating duration.\n\"I'm not trying to teach anyone a lesson or anything,\" he says, \"but I do think it's good for the ecosystem that a film like this which is completely uncompromised - I don't like too many cooks in my kitchen - for that to have made $30m globally so far, that's exciting.\n\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

I thought I just did enough but no excuses,\" said Catterall.\nBarboza Jr extended his unbeaten record to 32 pro wins \nEurope's largest indoor arena \u2013 with a capacity of 23,500 - was around a third full as a boisterous crowd repeatedly chanted 'Chorley' to welcome Lancastrian Catterall to the ring.\nQuite fittingly, he made his entrance to the song 'I just can't wait to be king' from the Lion King.\nCatterall, who started boxing aged 11 and turned pro in 2012, is a reserved family man, yet there has been a swagger and spring in his step throughout fight week. \nBarboza, though, had won all 31 of his pro fights and arrived in the UK full of confidence on the back of a career-best win over Jose Ramirez in November.\nNeither fighter was willing to overcommit early on and Catterall edged the first two rounds with the cleaner work. The Californian responded well, cutting off the ring and landing jabs and good body shots.\nA terrific counter-puncher, southpaw Catterall's approach, while appreciated by purists, does not always lend to the most entertaining of styles.\nHe landed a great two-punch combination in the sixth round, before his rival returned the favour with a flush right.\nCatterall was warned for a low blow in the seventh and, as the round drew to a close, his legs dipped after a right from Barboza.\nThe Catterall faithful turned the volume up a notch when the American hit the canvas in the 11th. He instantly shot up to his feet and protested a slip, with replays showing he fell over Catterall's trailing leg as a jab landed.\nBarboza and Catterall both celebrated at the final bell as pundits and ringside reporters shrugged their shoulders and compared contrasting scorecards with the decision too close to call.\nA frustrated Catterall was consoled by trainer Jamie Moore\n\nThe loss was disappointing for Catterall, who was enjoying a golden period in his career. In the past 15 months, he had beaten former champions Taylor, Jorge Linares and Regis Prograis.\nBut he came up against an undefeated foe who was motivated by his own pursuit for world honours.\n\"I want to see him go and fight for the world title, hopefully he beats Teofimo,\" added Catterall. \"It's straight back to the gym for me.\"\nCatterall missed out on becoming England's first male undisputed champion in the four-belt era when he lost to Taylor three years ago in Glasgow. Most ringside observers felt he should have been awarded the decision against the Scot.\nIf he does not ever win a world title, that loss \u2013 and the injustice of it \u2013 may unfortunately be what 'El Gato' will be most remembered for.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

        "article_text": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues. \nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model. They've got some outstanding young German coaches. We have one coaching our national team, which is fantastic.\n\"What you see - and this is over the last 10 years - is that they have younger coaches who have been given opportunities in the Bundesliga.\n\"They've been more exposed to that level earlier, so maybe that's something we can look at. But, for me, it's not about the nationality of a manager, it's about the qualities that they bring.\"\nWith just 20 managerial spots available does the Premier League feel a bit of a closed shop?\n\"Sometimes,\" says Still. \"But it's difficult to sort of have a grasp or a proper sense of what the reality is.\n\"I don't know what those Premier League clubs are thinking. I don't know how they're working. I don't know what their next step in their recruitment process is.\n\"It's the best league in the world for a reason so you've got to be one of the best in the world and that's what I think we all aspire to do.\"\nRosenior sees it somewhat differently.\n\"I think it depends on what your ultimate goal is,\" he says. \"My ultimate goal isn't to be in the Premier League.\n\"I don't think football is a linear thing where you say, 'Right, I worked in the Championship, I'm going to go to the Premier League'.\n\"My ultimate goal is to be the best coach I can be and it's up to the decision makers at each football club to pick who they think the right coach is for their club.\"\nThere was a time when few British players ventured overseas, but the numbers are growing season upon season. Should British coaches seek to do similar?\n\"I think it's a great experience,\" says Still \"I think learning about different cultures, different ways of playing the game, different opposition, different players. I'd definitely encourage it because you open yourself up to a lot more.\"\nRosenior adds: \"It's not for me to say to anyone where they should take their careers. And it's not about nationality. It's just about being the best person you can be and working as hard as you can every day.\"\nBoth Rosenior and Still have worked exceptionally hard to get to where they are right now in their careers and the decisions they have made have set them on a collision course which will culminate, temporarily at least, at Lens' Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Sunday.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

The tribunal states that whether its decision has any benefit to the club, therefore, depends on whether the new APT rules are found to be lawful as part of the second challenge issued by the club last month. \n\"The League continues to believe that the new APT Rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter.\n\"The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to the Premier League for fair market value assessment.\"\nAPTs are commercial deals involving clubs and companies to which they have close ties. Restrictions on fair market values (FMVs) were introduced in December 2021, shortly after a Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle.\nThe Premier League has the right to assess the value of such deals to ensure they have not been inflated, which could give clubs more to spend under current financial rules.\nLast year, a tribunal ruled that low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the APTs. It also ruled that changes made to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\nFollowing the ruling, City criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion the regulations could be swiftly amended and said there should be no vote on changes before a further determination by the panel.\nHowever, in November, the Premier League voted through the amendments.\nThe Premier League said the rule changes related to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\nEarlier this month, City launched a fresh legal challenge, claiming the amendments are \"unlawful\".\nThe Premier League has already had to spend tens of millions of pounds on legal bills due to a range of recent disputes over its financial regulations. \nNow it faces the threat of further costs after a significant defeat that could lead to some clubs seeking compensation for what some sources believe could be dozens of commercial deals undervalued or rejected as a result of rules that have now been deemed to be unenforceable.\nWhile City feel vindicated by this ruling, the league's governance and ability to uphold its rulebook will now come under renewed scrutiny. But it could get worse for those in charge of the top-flight.\nIf the same arbitration panel decides that the amended set of rules are also void, the league could face a crisis.\nThere could be little preventing clubs like Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City and Saudi-owned Newcastle United from signing more lucrative deals with state-linked companies. While such clubs would welcome less restrictions on sponsorships and loans with 'associated parties', some rivals fear the league's competitive balance would be on the line.\nEnglish football is already braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the Premier League's separate disciplinary case against City.\nThe champions, who are facing 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches, deny any wrongdoing.\nBut the next few weeks could now feature another legal decision that also has a profound impact on the league's future direction.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

It is certainly the first time I have scored two coming off the bench as a striker.\"\nHe told BBC Match Of The Day: \"It was big news for me this morning when one of the assistants told me this was an option. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do.\n\"Mikel told me to use my strengths in the box and I was in the right place at the right time.

It's not right.\"\nAs part of an effort organizers dubbed #TeslaTakeover, clutches of protesters across the country gathered outside the company's showrooms, having largely planned when to meet and where on the social media platform Bluesky, an upstart competitor to Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.\nIn some places, those protests barely numbered a dozen, with people in Washington DC, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Lyndhurst, Ohio, stamping their feet to stay warm amid snow and cold weather. Some held signs that read \"Say no to Doge\" and \"Deport Musk\".\nThe protest in Berkeley - a top California city for electric car ownership - numbered 200.\nAs part of his White House-backed effort called Doge, for Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has been sending teams into government agencies to comb through data and pushing for massive spending cuts as well as \"clawbacks\" of money already spent. \nPresident Donald Trump, who received an historic amount of campaign donations from Musk, is on the same page, freezing hiring as well as laying off thousands of federal employees.\nMusk says he has uncovered wasteful spending and his work is aimed at making the government operate more smoothly. But to many, he is stopping the government from functioning while making decisions that should be left to elected leaders and accessing private information.\n\"It's just really grinding on the mind,\"  said Dale Koistinen. \"I'm 84 years old. This is unbelievable. This is a takeover of our government.\"\nAlong with X, Musk also is the primary owner SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. But it is Tesla he is most known for and Tesla is where people unhappy with his Doge work are taking out their anger.\nFor days, concerned Americans have been asking fellow citizens to dump their Tesla stock and sell their Tesla vehicles.\nSinger-songwriter Sheryl Crow posted a video to Instagram that showed her Tesla being towed away.\n\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,\" she wrote in the caption. \"So long Tesla.\"\nCrow added that she was donating proceeds from the car's sale to National Public Radio in the U.S., a frequent target of Musk's ire.\nTesla stock surged following Donald Trump's election in November. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election effort, and hit the trail on Trump's behalf in the final days of the campaign.\nBut after touching an all-time high in December, the company's shares have shed 30% of their value with a pronounced selloff since Trump was inaugurated last month.\nSaturday's protests were promoted by prominent disinformation researcher Joan Donovan and the actor Alex Winter, who played Bill in the 80s movie \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.\" \nTeah Jackson, though, noticed the Berkeley protest during an outing with her girlfriend, and stopped to show her support.\n\"It's hopeful,\" Jackson told the BBC. \"It's an acknowledgement that people aren't going to go down without a fight and that they're going to continue to push for what they believe in.\"",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women.

        "summary": "India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died7 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, London\u2022@geetapandeybbcGetty ImagesIndia is among a few dozen countries that do not recognise marital rapeWarning: This report contains some disturbing detailsAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.The lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". \"Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.The British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.India government says criminalising marital rape 'excessively harsh'In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriageThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. \"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. \"The court documents make for grim reading.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.Getty ImagesA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to criminalise marital rapeThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".",

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Brentford have been iffy but he was a huge part of why they were able to walk away with a 1-0 victory against West Ham. It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

Somebody has worked hard to get it good,\" she said.\n\"I think if they just add a little more honesty when they are visiting these places, I think that is definitely needed.\"\nAshley French, an owner of the restaurants French Village and Orto in Belfast, said that influencers are a \"mixed bag\".\n\"It depends who it is really; there are ones who are genuine\u2026 then you have others who are potentially just wanting an invite to the opening of an envelope,\" he said.\nMr French said that while his restaurants will often be visited by influencers, he doesn't invite them or offer them payment or a discounted meal.\n\"Our feeling is that we would rather look after the paying public\".\nHe said that people are more likely to decide to eat at his restaurants based on word of mouth than social media.\nJohnny Mooney and Ben Kane, the content creators behind @foodandcraic, told BBC News NI that they \"definitely\" don't consider themselves food critics.\nMr Kane said they make videos purely \"to talk highly about places that we enjoy\".\n\"If we don't enjoy the experience, we don't post it,\" Mr Mooney added. \n\"Our content allows you to visually see what you're getting... so the opinion you'll form from our content will probably be more well-rounded than from written [content],\" he said.\nMs Jackson said branded is \"very important\" to help influencers \"stay afloat\".\nBut she added that she won't recommend something that she didn't enjoy in paid-for reviews.\nEd Senior, a compliance executive at the Advertising Standards Agency, told BBC News NI that the \"whole point\" of influencer marketing is that people can \"produce advertising in a style that they know their followers connect with because it's the same as their editorial content\".\n\"For us that's why it's exceptionally important that actually when it is advertising that it's absolutely clear that it's disclosed as such,\" he added.\nHe said that if a brand asks a creator to make content and pays them either with money or with a free or discounted meal, then it should be classified as advertising. \nHe said that once something is disclosed as advertising, it also needs to meet certain regulations, including whether it is \"accurate and fair\".\nAlongside work educating creators, Mr Senior said that \"targeted enforcement action, when necessary against those [creators] who are established, helps to bring about compliance from the sector as a whole\".",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "article_text": "As White Lotus season three is released, executive producer Mark Kamine explains the behind-the-scenes wrangling and key challenges when choosing a filming location.\nIt's being called the \"White Lotus effect\": the way that major TV shows influence the way we travel, thanks to the hit TV show that's back on 16 February 2025.\nThe black comedy-drama, written by Mike White, is in a new location for a third season, following the guests and staff of fictional five-star resort, the White Lotus. The dark drama satirises the excesses of the rich, set against the struggles of the staff, in a glamorous setting.\u00a0\nIt's thrilling, pacey stuff with beautiful people, gripping action and a tense setup that tells you from episode one, that although this looks like paradise, something terrible is going to happen. In the first season, a coffin is unloaded from a plane; while in the second, a body is discovered floating in the sea by a guest. Season three's trailer is peppered with shots of guns and whispers of body bags amid the palm trees and luxury spa treatments.\nDespite the gory details and the lampooning of the rich, everyone wants to stay at the White Lotus. When it was announced mid 2024 that Thailand would be the location for the TV show's third season, global interest in travel to the country soared, with booking platforms reporting immediate increases in searches, and airlines including Finnair adding extra weekly flights to Phuket. Hotels.com reported a 40% spike in booking interest for the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, one of the filming locations.\u00a0\nThe expectations come with a precedent: the Sicilian hotel, the Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in Taormina, Sicily, where season two was filmed, reported it was booked out for six months when it reopened after filming and continues to attract guests wanting a slice of the White Lotus lifestyle. The original White Lotus, the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, Hawaii, said it saw a 425% uptick year on year in website visits and 386% increase in availability checks.\nThe White Lotus isn't the first drama to have an outsized effect on the travel industry \u2013 the impact of films like Lord of the Rings and The Sound of Music on tourism has been well documented, as has the much-criticised Emily in Paris. But what's interesting right now, in the digital age, is how quickly news about a streamed TV show setting can have an impact.\n\"Back in 2015, research showed that around one in five people coming to Britain were coming because of something they'd seen on TV,\" said screen tourism specialist Seren Welch. \"Fast forward to now, and the latest Visit Britain research shows that nine in 10 visitors to the UK are influenced by what they have seen in film and TV. It's unheard of.\"\u00a0\nThis rise is down to the prevalence of streaming platforms: as Welch notes, 10 years ago, we didn't have Disney+ and Netflix was a lesser phenomenon. Today, streaming algorithms are powerful drivers of our behaviour far beyond the screen, with the opportunity to binge-watch everything anywhere leading viewers to be ever more immersed.\n\"I've heard a British Airways exec say that when they see a spike in traffic to a destination, they look at what's peaking on Netflix to explain it,\" Welch said.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to planning a location for a TV show like The White Lotus, Mark Kamine knows a thing or two. Kamine, one of The White Lotus's executive producers, started his career as a location scout working on all six seasons of The Sopranos, along with film credits on Hollywood films including Ted, American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook.\nHis new book On Locations: Lessons Learned From my Life on Set with the Sopranos and in the Film Industry details the behind-the-scenes wrangling inherent in location work, from negotiating with strip club owners keen to do under-the-table deals, to pacifying home owners who have just found out you've staged a mafia killing in their house. It's a lively read, running through the behind-the-scenes production level details about how to make one destination stand in for another on the tightest of tight budgets.\nWhile many of Kamine's previous film and TV productions have had financial issues constraining filming locations, when it came to The White Lotus, the wild success of the first seasons meant that when deciding the location for season three, there was plenty of choice.\u00a0\n\"Mike White had the idea for something around Eastern philosophy,\" Kamine explained. \"We were looking for what was practical and eye-catching, and to start with, Korea, Philippines, Japan, Bali and Sri Lanka were in the mix, as well as Thailand.\"\u00a0\nFurther discussion and research narrowed the choice to Japan and Thailand, with White and Kamine and others making research trips to see what would work best. (White typically stays in the resort to write and research the show ahead of production.)\nKamine notes in his book that the key challenges faced by location scouts centre on budgets: productions often end up being shot in dupe locations, where, for example, Prague might stand in for New Jersey, because even when subsidised, US locations can't compete with European, Asian or African crew and material costs. But for a sure-fire hit like The White Lotus, which had a reported $38.5m budget for season two and drew in 4.1 million US viewers for its finale, Karmine and his team chose the option that reflected the story they wanted to tell best, rather than make a financial compromise.\n\"Mike said that he feels like we've cracked the code,\" Kamine admitted, \"in that we've figured out how to stay in these luxury locations and create great TV. What a life.\"\nThe new series is filmed in the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, with the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Villas and Anantara Bophut Koh Samui Resort also featured \u2013 along with a little creative licence.\u00a0\n\"Anyone who has been to the Four Seasons in Sicily that we used in the show will know that the beach isn't where it seems to be,\" said Kamine. \"Some scenes in season three are shot at one hotel, and some aspects are filmed elsewhere. The common spaces need to have real impact, that's a driver here. Overall, the main thing is that it looks beautiful.\"\u00a0\nThe White Lotus team are aware of the impact the filming has on future bookings and the local tourism scene. Kamine says he keeps in touch with the hotel managers from the previous series and is aware of the debate around overtourism, noting that these popular five-star locations already have existing tourism infrastructure and have been developed to handle a certain number of visitors.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0White Lotus 3 Thailand filming locations revealed\n\u2022\u00a0The White Lotus season three review\n\u2022\u00a0'Set-jetting': How on-screen locations are becoming travel destinations\nHowever, given that films shot in Thailand have driven a surge of tourism in the past \u2013\u00a0the extreme popularity of The Beach caused Maya Bay to close, for instance \u2013\u00a0it's somewhat surprising to find that Thailand has no plan in place to mitigate a potential tourism surge from the show. A spokesperson from Tourism Thailand noted that the country is still trying to build back its tourism industry following Covid, and that since the show airs in Thailand's shoulder season, it is most likely to boost tourism numbers in these quieter months when there is more capacity than in peak season.\nThe White Lotus isn't the only streaming show boosting holiday bookings. As set-jetting continues to be a popular motif in the travel industry, new series including Yellowstone prequel 1923, set in Montana, are expected to drive more tourism. It's not without its problems: in 2023, The Washington Post reported that Yellowstone has driven tourism to the region but has brought with it misconceptions: it does rain, it can be cold, and not everyone is as well dressed as the show would have you believe. That's showbusiness.\nSeason two of Wednesday, also releasing this year, is a good case in point: the show is set in a fictional town in Vermont but season one was shot in Romania and season two filmed in Ireland. The final season of Stranger Things will air later this year as well, set in the town of Hawkins, Indiana but filmed in Jackson, Georgia. It's a known filming location \u2013 The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries were also shot there \u2013 and the local tourism authority already has information on how to follow the shows around town. Tellingly, it notes that \"the upside down is NOT included\".\nAs for The White Lotus, now that season three is out, thoughts are turning to season four. Kamine wouldn't confirm or deny any location currently under discussion for the next series but did let slip that one thing is important: going back perhaps to his Soprano days, it needs to be somewhere where it's easy to dump a body.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)",

        "article_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has said any Ukraine peace deal would require a \"US backstop\" to deter Russia from attacking its neighbour again. \nSpeaking after a hastily convened meeting with European leaders in Paris, he said a \"US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia\", and vowed to discuss the \"key elements\" of a peace deal with US President Donald Trump in Washington next week. \nThe prime minister repeated that he would consider deploying UK troops to Ukraine in the event of a lasting peace agreement. \nBut Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a key Nato ally, said for his part, discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was \"completely premature\".\nSir Keir said Europe would \"have to do more\" to defend the continent in the face of the \"generational\" security challenge Russia posed.\nHe avoided explaining exactly what he meant by a \"backstop\" - but his allies suggest this could involve air support, logistics and intelligence capabilities.\nThe talks at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace were held to discuss concerns over the Trump administration's decision to initiate peace talks with Russia - due to start in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday - alone. \nSir Keir was joined by the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, as well as the president of the European Council and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Kyiv did not know about talks in Saudi Arabia and would not recognise any agreement made without its involvement.\nUS officials have suggested European nations would be consulted on peace talks with Russia, but not directly involved in them.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron posted on X in the early hours of Tuesday that he had \"just spoken\" with Trump and Zelensky.\n\"We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,\" he said, adding that he \"will continue these discussions in the coming days\".\nPrior to the meeting, the European leaders had also expressed concern after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was \"unrealistic\" to expect Ukraine would return to its borders before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. \nHegseth downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato - something Sir Keir had said it was on an \"irreversible\" path towards.\nHe also said Europe would have to be primarily responsible for guaranteeing its own security going forward.\nSir Keir said the US was \"not going to leave Nato\" but that it was \"time to take responsibility for our security, our continent\".\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said transatlantic relations were in a \"new stage\",  and that the meeting had confirmed the time had come for \"a much greater ability for Europe to defend itself\".\nSir Keir has indicated any troop contributions from the UK would be part of a multinational force to police the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory.\nBut experts say to do so effectively would be a massive undertaking that would require a large increase in defence spending.\nLiberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called on Sir Keir to recall Parliament to discuss plans to defend Ukraine.\nParliament is currently in recess and is due to reconvene on 24 February.\nSir Keir's spokesperson said Parliament would be consulted \"as appropriate\" but this was \"getting ahead of discussions\" with other world leaders.\nMalcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, said that, unlike UN peacekeeping forces there to observe, if the force being proposed was intended to deter Russian attacks, it would be a \"whole different matter altogether\".\n\"You need credible, well-armed forces - and you not only need frontline forces, you need back-up forces, and air forces, and so on,\" he told the BBC. \"That's a much bigger ask.\"\nGeneral Sir Adrian Bradshaw, a former Nato commander, said: \"This cannot be a token force, it cannot be something that observes bad behaviour and stands on the sideline.\"\nThe former head of the British Army, Lord Dannatt, previously estimated such a force would need around 100,000 troops - with the UK contributing about two-fifths.\n\"We just haven't got that number available,\" he said on Saturday, adding that getting the military into shape to perform this role would come at a considerable cost.\nThe UK currently spends around 2.3% of its total economic output on defence. The government has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5%, but has not said when this will be achieved.\nSir Keir earlier told reporters that the government would set out a path to meeting the 2.5% commitment once it finishes its strategic defence review.\n\"Part of my message to our European allies is that we've all got to step up on both capability and on spending and funding,\" he said. \n\"That includes the UK, which is why I've made that commitment to spend more.\"\nSome European figures have signalled their agreement with this. \nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Europe had to \"step up\" defence spending and support for Ukraine, as \"Russia is threatening all of Europe now, unfortunately\", while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a \"surge\" in defence spending.\nNo 10 confirmed Sir Keir's trip to Washington earlier on Monday, after a minister said the UK could serve as a \"bridge\" between the US and Europe.\nThe BBC understands the PM offered to host a follow-up meeting of European leaders following the Washington trip. \nPoland's Tusk has already indicated his nation would not send troops into Ukraine, but would continue to support it with military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nUK government sources argue it is \"no surprise\" there was a difference of opinion between leaders, and that not every nation is willing to show their hand quite yet.\nBritish diplomats do not believe every nation would need to commit to contributing troops - but some would. And whatever Europe's eventual role, US involvement would still be required.\nProf Chalmers said: \"Having significant numbers of Nato troops on Ukrainian soil after a ceasefire would be a failure for Russia, so it's hard for me at this point to see Russia accepting such a presence as a part of the deal.\"\nFighting on the ground in Ukraine continued over the weekend, with at least three civilians killed in Russian strikes on Sunday, according to local authorities.\nSeveral areas of Ukraine are under an emergency blackout following attacks on energy infrastructure, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones on Sunday night.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

        "article_text": "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.\nSea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.\nBut as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.\nThis latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.\nOver the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).\nThis breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.\nArctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.\nThe decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.\nBut until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.\nSince then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.\n\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.\n\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"\nAntarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.\nBut warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.\nThe Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.\n\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"\nAntarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.\nAt the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.\nBut current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.\nThis is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.\nAs well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.\n\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.\nIn recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.\nThis \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.\nThis very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.\nBut, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.\nThe Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.\nDeclining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.\nPolar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.\n\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.\nSea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.\n\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Northern Ireland's Tom McKibbin joined the tour last month, opting to forgo the PGA Tour card he secured two months earlier and going against the advice of compatriot and mentor Rory McIlroy.President Trump is on PGA's side in LIV dispute - McIlroyPublished4 days agoLeading LIV Golf player to get spot in The OpenPublished7 days agoMcKibbin confirms switch to LIV GolfPublished29 JanuaryFour-time major winner McIlroy has been a vocal critic of LIV Golf but has softened his position in recent times and now believes it is time for golf to unify.In a step towards that, McIlroy and fellow PGA Tour superstar Scottie Scheffler played against LIV Golf pair DeChambeau and Koepka in a floodlight exhibition match in December.This month the US Open and The Open announced exemptions for the leading LIV Golf player who is not already exempt for this year's championships.McIlroy played in the successful 2014 European Ryder Cup team captained by McGinley, who believes the sport is not currently financially viable.",

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.",

The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

        "article_text": "US black nationalist leader Malcolm X was assassinated on 21 February 1965, at the age of 39. The BBC reported on the reaction in his adopted home of Harlem, New York, as thousands of people queued to pay their last respects.\nAt a time when black civil rights leaders were preaching peaceful integration, Malcolm X's uncompromising vision of black separatism inspired many people, while terrifying others. He was murdered in February 1965, and a reporter for the BBC's Panorama, Michael Charlton, stated at his funeral that he \"spoke a vengeful message, as forthright and chilled as the winter morning they buried him\". Amid tight security, the many thousands of people who had filed past his body were searched by police as a precaution against bombings. \"To these people, he preached that if the white man didn't answer for the black man's frustration, he must answer for his fury,\" added Charlton.\nHe was internationally famous for his incendiary rhetoric, yet he had been developing a new, more moderate worldview. Asked what the death of Malcolm X meant to him by Panorama, one clearly upset man who was in the queue said: \"It's a blow to every black person in the United States of America.\" A young man described him as a hero, saying: \"He stood out among all black people. He showed the white man where it was at.\" This interviewee was one of several people who feared that more violence would follow. \"Whoever did it, Muslims or whoever did it, there's going to be a whole lot of hurt,\" he predicted. One young woman said: \"I don't believe it. Why would they kill another black man?\" Another woman had no doubt who was responsible: \"The white power structure in America is behind it. They quickly capitalised on it by saying that one of his own kind did it, but they put it up to be done. They know they had more to gain by getting Malcolm X out of the way than they had to let him live.\"\nMalcolm X was shot dead on stage at a New York ballroom as he prepared to deliver a speech to his Organization of Afro-American Unity. His wife and children were in the audience. Three men convicted of his murder were all members of the Nation of Islam, the political and religious body that, a year earlier, Malcolm X had left amid acrimony. One of the men was caught while attempting to flee, and confessed to the murder, but the other two convictions resulted in a long-running miscarriage of justice campaign. In 2021, a New York state judge agreed, and their convictions were quashed. Both men were later fully exonerated after New York's attorney general found prosecutors had withheld evidence that, in all likelihood, would have cleared them of blame for the murder.\nStill a controversial figure 60 years after his death, Malcolm\u00a0X remains to some the ultimate symbol of rage and resistance in the face of oppression. Born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska, he was the son of a Baptist preacher. When\u00a0Malcolm\u00a0was six years old, his father was killed in what many believe was a deliberate racist attack by white supremacists, although nobody knows for sure if this was the case. The shock of his father being killed led his mother to have a mental breakdown, and Malcolm and his seven siblings were shipped out to foster homes. He fell into a life of crime, and in 1946 he was jailed for burglary. While in prison, he discovered a love of learning and self-improvement. There, he encountered the ideas of the Nation of Islam, a political and religious body that argued that equality for black Americans could only be achieved through black and white people living in separate states.\u00a0\nUpon his release from prison in 1952, he formally changed his name to Malcolm X. It was a firm rejection of the surname that had been given to his family by the people who, generations earlier, had enslaved them. He toured the US, spreading the Nation of Islam's message, and discovered that he had the power and charisma to inspire people with his words. Public speaking was a skill he had learnt, having entered prison as a middle-school dropout who, he admitted, \"didn't know a verb from a house\". He was not afraid to use shock tactics to get his message across, condemning white people as the \"white devil\" for the historic oppression of black people.\u00a0When US President John F Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, he said it was \"chickens coming home to roost\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nWhile Malcolm X attracted many followers, he also made a lot of enemies. In March 1964 he announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam, having become disillusioned with its leadership. That same month, he witnessed a debate in Washington DC about the Civil Rights Bill, and he finally met Martin Luther King, Jr, a civil rights leader whose belief in nonviolent protest was often seen as being in stark contrast with Malcolm X's more confrontational philosophy.\u00a0\nTo deepen his Muslim faith, he went on the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He wrote about how he witnessed \"pilgrims of all colours from all parts of this Earth displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood like I've never seen before\". He also toured several countries in Africa, where he made the decision to form a new secular group that sought to reconnect African Americans with their heritage. Upon his return to the US, he renounced the teachings of the Nation of Islam. Around that time, Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz began receiving death threats over the phone, and their home was firebombed.\u00a0\nDespite apparent threats coming from many directions, he continued making his electrifying public appearances. In June 1964, he officially launched his Organization of Afro-American Unity, telling the gathered audience: \"We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary.\" The venue was the Audubon Ballroom in New York's Washington Heights neighbourhood; eight months later he was murdered on that same stage.\nAs mourners continued to file past Malcolm X's body in a Harlem funeral home, Charlton asked several prominent people about what sort of leader he might have become. Malcolm X had become a regular visitor to the United Nations headquarters in New York, according to Daniel Watts, the editor of black nationalist magazine The Liberator. Watts said that he had been highlighting discrimination against black people in the US to members of the Afro-Asian bloc. \"I think for the first time in the history of the struggle here in this country, we had a molecule of hope \u2013 hope in the sense in knowing that we had a heritage, we had roots, we had a motherland to which we could look for,\" he said.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr, a misunderstood icon of US history\n\u2022\u00a0The day Nelson Mandela walked out of prison a free man\n\u2022\u00a0Nina Simone on how racial injustice fuelled her songs\nJames Farmer, director of the Congress of Racial Equality, told Panorama that while Malcolm X had not been a part of the civil rights movement, his \"more extreme stance\" had boosted its position. He said: \"The public saw very clearly that unless they did what the civil rights movement demanded, they might get Malcolm X. In fact, Malcolm said just that to me once after a debate we had. He said, 'You know you ought to stop pushing us around like this.' I asked why. He said, 'Because we help you. We make a lot of noise, people look at us and scream bloody murder, and then turn to you.'\" Farmer said that Malcolm X had been successful in giving younger black people a sense of identity. \"It has been very important because a person cannot have a sense of destiny for the future unless he believes he is somebody first.\"\nFarmer also said that Malcolm X had been trying to broaden his appeal since his split with the Nation of Islam. \"I feel that his position was in a state of flux, and that he was moving closer toward an integrationist and desegregationist position. He was over at my house just six weeks before he died, and there I asked him if his views had changed on racial issues and he indicated it was true, he was giving up black racism. Now he was prepared, he told me, to accept a man on the basis of his deeds rather than his genes. This was a switch.\"\nPoet Maya Angelou was a friend of Malcolm X who had reconnected with him during his Africa trip when he visited Ghana, where she was living at the time. Speaking in 1992, she told the BBC: \"He came to Ghana and said, 'I have found blue-eyed men who I'm able to call brother, so my prior statement that all whites were devils is erroneous.' It takes an incredible amount of courage to be able to say, 'Say everybody, you remember what I said yesterday? I've found out that's wrong.' And that's what he was able to do. That was amazing.\"\nCharlton concluded his Panorama report on Malcolm X's funeral by observing that he \"died too soon after his adoption of more moderate views for us to know what wider appeal he may have attracted\". He said the \"most arresting epitaph\" he heard that week came from a black person who said, \"I don't know how many followers he had, but he had a hell of a lot of well-wishers.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.\nAll the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.\nThe bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.\nGoing back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.\nIt was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.\n\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.\nBut for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.\n\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.\nAnother farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.\n\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.\nAlso known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThey are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.\nStanding at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.\nBut with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.\n\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.\nIn the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.\nThis decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.\n\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.\nAround Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. \nConservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.\nDozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.\n\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.\nMr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.\nFarmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.\n\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.\n\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.\nSarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.\nCranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.\n\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.\nTheir exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.\nBut crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.\n\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.\nThey attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.\nScientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.\nAny destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.\nTheir monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.\n\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich.

Why Uganda's iconic crested crane faces extinction2 days agoWycliffe MuiaBBC News, MbararaGetty ImagesWith its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.During the BBC's visit to Mbarara it proved difficult to find crested cranes - except early in the morningAnd in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law. \"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.Conservationists recommend farmers use scarecrows instead of poison\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. \"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.",

        "article_text": "In an old Welsh farmhouse a group of friends chatter and joke while tucking into a lunch of home-made soup and sourdough. \nBut behind this convivial scene a \"gnarly and unpleasant\" legal battle is underway.\nLast year, Brithdir Mawr - an 80-acre (32-hectare) farm in Newport, Pembrokeshire, that has been home to an off-grid community for the past 30 years - was sold to a new owner who plans to turn it into a retreat centre.\nThe community were issued with an eviction notice and some members left by the 31 December deadline, but others refused and are determined to remain. \nWill Cooke, who has lived with the community for four-and-a half years, said he hoped the adults who remained living on the site could come to an arrangement with the new owner that would work for all.\n\"There are no bad people in this situation, there are just many, many people trying their hardest to do the right thing and we've got into a glitch with each other,\" he said.\n\"I want us all to sit down with each other and try and straighten it out.\"\nBrithdir Mawr was established in 1993 by Julian Orbach with his then wife Emma and was originally part of a site of 160 acres (64 hectares).\nAfter the couple separated the site was split into two, with Emma establishing the neighbouring Tir Ysbrydol [Welsh for spiritual house] community and Mr Orbach remaining at Brithdir Mawr.\nIn 2002, he moved out but remained Brithdir Mawr's landlord. \nWhen Mr Orbach decided to sell, he said he \"very much\" wanted the community to continue and it was given first refusal to purchase the site. \nBut after the community's 10-year bid to raise the \u00a31m for the purchase, he sold the site last year to Rachel May, who is described as a shadow work and mindfulness coach, doula [offering help and support] and soul guide.\nShe has not responded to requests to be interviewed.\n\"We are aware that Rachel is our new owner, we are very aware of the fact that she's spent a large amount of money to do this, but the way in which she is wanting to bring about this process of change is completely out of alignment with who we are as a community,\" said Will.\n\"We've invited Rachel to come and visit with us several times, to come and negotiate with us to find a way forward that works for everyone.\" \nWill was a teacher and later worked for Extinction Rebellion UK before moving in with the community. \n\"I was expecting to spend two weeks here and I never left,\" he said. \n\"It's a really good fit for me, I get on really well here and feel like I'm valued and appreciated for who I am.\"\nThe community's members are dedicated to sustainable living. They keep goats - primarily to make cheese and occasionally for meat - as well as chickens, grow their own vegetables and manage the site's woodland.\nThe building runs off hydropower and a tiny wind turbine and is heated by a log burner. \nThey host weekly Welsh language classes, run workshops, open days and volunteer weeks to demonstrate their way of life.\nMany in the community have jobs away from the farm, they eat communally five times a week and, before the community's families left ahead of the eviction notice, the children were home-schooled.\nWill and the other members each pay rent as well as their contribution to \"food club\", bills, and a savings pot for expenses such as building repairs. \nWith no-one in charge, decisions are made collaboratively and their shared values include inclusivity, gratitude and valuing learning and culture. \nDoes living in this way come with the occasional conflict?\n\"There absolutely are difficulties at times,\" admitted Will.\n\"Occasionally conflicts happen... but there are far fewer than there are beautiful times.\"\nHe said the community tried to take blame out of conflict.\n\"A conflict for me is when we find a glitch in the way in which we're working, no-one's at fault,\" he said.\nHe said \"detangling\" conflicts when there was no-one in charge was \"very deep and intense work and often very painful, but by the end of it we find ourselves stronger, more beautiful, able to act with each other in a more beautiful way\".\nRosie Gilam, who grew up in nearby Cardigan, is Will's partner and spends about three days a week with him at Brithdir Mawr.\nShe has been visiting the community since she was a child and previously lived in communities in Cornwall. \n\"A major wonderful thing about being human is to accept others for what they are, understand they've got their own needs which might not intersect completely with your needs, and to come to a place where you're accepting of your differences and find a way to work together,\" she said.\n\"I think that is so needed on the planet at the moment.\" \nLike Will, she insisted \"nobody's to blame\" for the community's current predicament. \nShe said the situation was an example of \"broken systems\" which meant \"tenants don't have rights, a family can be turfed out of its home with little notice, and that people generally don't have affordable access to land\". \nShe hopes media attention on Brithdir Mawr will start a conversation about land rights and be \"one step towards systemic change\". \n\"So for example, there might be community right to buy, which means that a community like this in the future would have the right to buy an asset,\" she said.  \nAndromeda Gervasio, who is from Portugal, moved to the UK 12 years ago, and moved to Brithdir Mawr last summer after feeling burnt out with city life, \"craving a different lifestyle\" and being drawn to \"intentional community\".\n\"The water is the purest water I've ever drank, and the food is the best food I've ever eaten,\" they said.\n\"People are here not just because, there's a bigger purpose of really living together and sharing the work that it is to live and to live in a place like this... it's pretty incredible.\"\nThey said they cherished being accepted in the countryside. \n\"Being a queer person in the rural landscape has always been something that I was generally scared about... and then actually discovering it and feeling incredibly safe here, I've been so grateful... and I think that I owe lots to Brithdir in that regard,\" they said.\nLike the rest of their community, Andromeda insisted they did not feel animosity towards the new owner. \n\"We're not up against a particular person but a system and a normalised way of going about things,\" they said.\n\"Just because someone has the legal backing to do something, it doesn't necessarily make it okay or how the world should be.\n\"We have a history of things that were within legal bounds not corresponding to what is morally OK to do... [denying] women's rights, slavery and queer witch hunts were all legal at some point.\"\nFor now, what will happen next for the community is uncertain.  \n\"Essentially I feel really, really sad about it,\" said Rosie. \nShe lives in hope of all parties sitting down together and looking for a solution \"with an open heart\". \nWill is confident a resolution can be found.\n\"I don't know exactly what that would look like and that's OK,\" he said. \n\"This complexity and this difficulty feels very difficult, feels gnarly and unpleasant, but also I truly believe that something very special is happening.\n\"I look forward to this process continuing and resolving in a way that works for everyone in the near future.\"",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim was appointed Manchester United manager in November \nWhen Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag in October, they were 14th in the Premier League table and seven points from both the top four and the bottom three. \nFast forward three and a half months and the club are 15th, 15 points from the top four and 12 points above the relegation zone after suffering a 1-0 defeat by Tottenham - the eighth league defeat under new manager Ruben Amorim.\nThere has been no 'new manager bounce' with Portuguese coach Amorim saying he has \"a lot of problems\" and his job is \"so hard\".\nIt is no secret that United are enduring a historically poor Premier League campaign but just how large are the problems facing Amorim? \nAmorim may have jumped the gun when he described this side as \"the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United\" in January. \nAfter all, the club were relegated from the first division in 1974.\nBut in the Premier League era, they are the worst statistically at this stage of a season. \nUnited's tally of 29 points from 25 matches is their lowest at this stage of a Premier League season\nUnited have lost 12 times in 25 matches, a loss rate of 48%. \nThe club are averaging 1.16 points-per-game, which, if continued, would give them an end-of-season points tally of 44 points from 38 matches. That would be their lowest Premier League points tally. \nUnited have won four, drawn two and lost eight of Amorim's 14 Premier League matches. \nOnly Tottenham, Wolves, Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton have earned fewer points than United's 14 in their 14 Premier League matches under Amorim. \nAmorim has managed 21 matches since joining United. He has won nine, drawn three and lost nine of those matches, giving him a win rate of 43%.\nThat is the lowest of any permanent Manchester United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 over their first 21 matches in charge, with Louis van Gaal (48%) the next lowest. \nJose Mourinho (52%), David Moyes (57%), Erik ten Hag (67%) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (71%) all had significantly better records in all competitions from their first 21 matches in charge. \nThis video can not be played\nAmorim 'not worried' about mounting pressure following Spurs defeat\nOf all of United's problems under Amorim, their inability to score enough goals is the most glaring. \nA deeper look at the numbers does not make for happy reading. \nUnited have scored 28 goals in 25 Premier League matches this season - a rate of 1.12 goals-per-game.\nOnly four teams in the division - Ipswich, Southampton, Leicester and Everton - have scored fewer.\nAmad Diallo, who has been ruled out of the remainder of the season with an ankle injury, is the side's top scorer in the Premier League (six) and all competitions (nine), while centre forwards Rasmus Hojlund (two) and Joshua Zirzkee (three) have managed just five goals in 45 Premier League appearances between them.\nIn 14 matches under Ten Hag this season, United's Expected-Goals-per-game (xG) was 1.7. This has fallen slightly under Amorim, with United's xG 1.6-per-game since he took charge.\nUnited's 'big chances' created record is identical under Ten Hag and Amorim this season, with the side creating 2.9 big chances each match.\nDespite United's struggles, captain Bruno Fernandes is fourth highest for chances created in the league (53). Cole Palmer (66) is top.\nUnited finished last season with a goal difference of -1, the first time they had ended a Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference. However, they are on course to eclipse that with a -7 goal difference this term. \nSimilarly, while the 57 goals they scored during the 2023-24 campaign was their joint-lowest in the Premier League, they are on course to score fewer this season. If they maintain their rate of 1.12 goals per game, they would finish with 44 scored.\nDuring the early weeks of Amorim's reign, the former Sporting boss bemoaned the lack of time he had been to spend with his players on the training ground.\nHowever with a less packed schedule with qualification for the Europa League knockout stages assured and a Carabao Cup exit at Tottenham's hands, Amorim has been able to spend more time on the training ground.\nBut a \"free week\" before Sunday's trip to Tottenham proved anything but productive.\nBetween the 2-1 win against Leicester City in the FA Cup on 7 February and Sunday's loss to Spurs, United lost six players.\nDiallo, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Toby Collyer were ruled out of the trip through injury, while Leny Yoro and Christian Eriksen fell ill.\nTheir absences added to the long-term casualties of Luke Shaw, Mason Mount, Lisandro Martinez and Jonny Evans. \nIt meant Amorim was forced to name an inexperienced bench against Spurs with Victor Lindelof joined by Elyh Harrison, Harry Amass, Tyler Fredricson, Jack Fletcher, Jack Moorhouse, Chido Obi, Ayden Heaven and Sekou Kone. \nSweden defender Lindelof was the only one of those to have previously played for the first team. \n\nManchester United made two signings in the January window, bringing in Patrick Dorgu from Italian club Lecce and defender Ayden Heaven from Arsenal but the squad was thinner by the end of the window than when it started as Marcus Rashford, Antony and Tyrell Malacia departed on loan.\nDorgu, a multi-functional left-footed Denmark international, should provide balance at wing-back to Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\nBut the decision to allow both Antony and Rashford to leave without signing a replacement looked risky at the time and is proving so now. \nTheir departures left Hojlund, Zirzkee, Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho as the side's only recognised forwards. That list is down to three now, given Diallo's season-ending injury.\nGarnacho has no Premier League goals or assists since Amorim joined.\nRashford has made two eye-catching substitute appearances for Aston Villa since moving to Birmingham, and he played a hand in Ollie Watkins' equaliser against Ipswich on Saturday.\nAs for Antony, the Brazilian has scored three times in four matches for Real Betis since moving to Spain. This matches the tally he managed during 38 appearances for United last season and means he has scored more so far in February than United have.\n'My job is so hard' - Amorim frustrated as Man Utd lose again\nChido Obi: The 'special' Man Utd academy striker makes debut\nMan Utd under 'pressure' & must sell to buy in summer - Amorim",

        "article_text": "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.\nRakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.\n\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.\nWhen Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.\n\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.\nHer teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.\nFor a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.\nA middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.\nThere was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.\nHowever, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.\nHe invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.\nWhen they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"\nCompetition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.\nOver time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.\nThey won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.\nRakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.\nThey missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.\nSimran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.\nBut in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.\nBut the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.\nSimran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.\n\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.\nSimran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.\nTheir first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.\n\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.\nBut by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.\nRiding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.\nBut Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.\nAlthough guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.\n\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.\nBoth Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.\nDespite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.\nRakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"\nThe BBC Indian Sportswoman Of The Year (ISWOTY) Award is back with its fifth edition to celebrate and honour the remarkable achievements of women athletes in India. Find out about the nominees - the winner will be announced on 17 February.",

A longer suspension would have made the sport cleaner? I don't think so.\"\nWorld number one Sinner banned for three months \nWhat happens next for Sinner after doping case?\nAre there different approaches to tennis doping cases? \nThe Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has criticised the apparent inconsistencies between recent doping cases.\nLast month it launched a new scheme offering players facing allegations of doping or corruption access to pro bono legal support.\nThe scheme was co-founded by former British doubles player Tara Moore, who served a two-year absence because of a doping ban which was later overturned.\nReacting to the news of Sinner's ban, Moore posted on X: \"Can someone explain how a negotiation was possible?\"\nA PTPA statement read: \"The 'system' is not a system. It's a club. Supposed case-by-case discretion is, in fact, merely cover for tailored deals, unfair treatment, and inconsistent rulings.\n\"It's not just the different results for different players. It's the lack of transparency. The lack of process. The lack of consistency...\n\"This bias is unacceptable for all athletes and shows a deep disrespect for every sport and its fans.\"\nFormer Wimbledon champion Simona Halep has previously accused the  International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) of double standards - a claim it has strenuously denied.\nHalep was given a four-year ban for two separate doping offences in 2022 which was later reduced to nine months.\nHalep was critical when it was announced world number two Swiatek would serve a one-month doping ban in November, posting on Instagram at the time: \"I stand and ask myself, why is there such a big difference in treatment and judgment?\n\"I can't find and I don't think there can be a logical answer. It can only be bad will from the ITIA, the organisation that has done absolutely everything to destroy me despite the evidence.\"\nSinner's lawyer Jamie Singer said the Italian's team should bear responsibility for mistakes that led to his failed drugs tests.\nThe ITIA found Sinner was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by his physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi during a massage.\nHe said: \"Wada has confirmed the facts determined by the Independent Tribunal. It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation.\"\nWada said it had entered into a settlement agreement with Sinner under provision 10.8.2 in its code.\nA spokesperson said: \"This provision was introduced to the code in 2021. Since then it has been used dozens of times for cases with exceptional circumstances such as this one. \n\"Given there are many thousands of cases, it is not used that often and is the exception rather than the rule but there has been plenty of precedent for this.\n\"Ultimately in this case three months represents a fair outcome under the specific circumstances.\"\nThe ATP, which runs men's tennis, said the case was an \"important reminder of players' responsibility to carefully manage the products and treatments they or their entourages use\".\nItalian Tennis and Padel Federation president Angelo Binaghi said Sinner would be welcomed with open arms at the Italian Open, which begins in Rome three days after his ban ends.\n\"This is the first time that a shameful injustice makes us happy because our first thought is for the boy who sees the end of a nightmare,\" Binaghi said.\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

But now we are living our dream,\" Chris says.\nDespite working \"every hour under the sun\" \u2013 Chris as a personal trainer and Tamira as a swimming teacher - they could not keep up with the cost of living in the UK.\n\"We went down to one car, we got rid of Sky TV, we didn't go on holiday but the bills kept going up and up,\" says Tamira.\n\"We only ate together as a family once a month because we didn't get time. We were just working to make ends meet.\"\nIt was during Covid that they first talked about selling up and travelling the world.\n\"We had a chance to breathe and we realised we didn't want to go back to the life we were living,\" Chris says.\nThe couple put their house up for sale in 2022 but it took longer to sell than they anticipated and they nearly backed out of the plan. When it finally sold in May 2023, they drove straight to Heathrow.\n\"Our last night in the house, we were all on the floor because we had sold all our furniture,\" says Chris. \n\"We didn't have the money to book our flights until we got the cash from the house, so we went to a hotel near Heathrow and booked flights to Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia].\n\"It was a huge risk. We thought it might not work and we might want to go home, but we've never looked back.\"\n\nChris taught himself videography before they left so he could document their travels on social media, which has turned into their biggest source of income.\n\"We were already making videos about family life, but we didn't have a huge amount of followers,\" the 36-year-old explains. \"We had 7,000 subscribers on YouTube but now we have 100,000, and we had about 12,000 on TikTok where as now we have 250,000.\"\nAfter exploring Malaysia, they went to Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and Qatar.\nIt was during their trip to China that their social media \"blew up\" and the family \"accidentally became famous\" in the country.\nOne video they made about their drinks being dropped off by a drone received eight million views on TikTok.\nThey also saw a huge growth on Chinese social media platforms, where they have over one million followers and their videos reach tens of millions of views.\nThe couple say the trip has been \"incredible\", but there have inevitably been tough times.\nTamira got dengue fever in Thailand, their family credit card got swallowed by a machine in Vietnam and all five of them got a sickness bug while staying in a hostel in the Philippines.\n\"Another difficult time was when we got lost in China. We were walking round with all our possessions in the early hours of the morning and our phone maps didn't work. But we eventually found our hotel and we can laugh about it now,\" Tamira says.\nThey have based themselves on the Malaysian island of Penang for the last few months, where their daughters, who are home schooled by Tamira, are \"thriving\".\n\"They are learning about different cultures, currencies, languages and how to get around,\" Chris says.\n\"All three of them have always been 110% on board with this idea, but if they ever changed their minds and wanted to go home, we would listen to them.\n\"They have grown in confidence so much and they make friends wherever they go. There are a lot of digital nomad families travelling round, who are working remotely.\"\nThe Hutchinsons say they have got the next five years planned out, with trips to Dubai, Australia, India, Sri Lanka and Cambodia on the cards this year.\nThey might also go back to the UK briefly, but they have no plans at the moment to return permanently, because their \"quality of life is so much better now\".\nThe couple receive lots of messages asking for advice and say they hope to inspire other parents.\n\"It's not flowers all the time but if you're a person who enjoys a challenge and enjoys spending time with your family, go for it. You will never know until you try,\" Tamira says.\n\"It was a dream and we made it happen,\" Chris adds. \"As a family we have loved every moment and we have risen to the challenges.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

That bout will have big implications on what is next for the heavyweight division.\nThe winner, and the loser, will have no shortage of options.\nElsewhere, Dillian Whyte fights Joe Joyce on 5 April. That fight night also includes the professional debut of Delicious Orie and an intriguing contest between Lawrence Okolie and Richard Riakporhe. The seasoned cruiserweights face off in what is unlikely to reveal much about their capabilities at heavyweight, but is set to be a fascinating bout considering the beef between the two rivals.\nMoses Itauma, who only turned 20 in December, is expected to be added to that event, but one fight that isn't happening is Deontay Wilder's imminent return. After many whispers, Wilder's team has cooled talk of a comeback for now.\nFrazer Clarke returns to action on 20 April against Ebenezer Tetteh.\nThis is the big question that continues to be asked. Fury caught everyone off guard when he announced his retirement last month, but there seem to be very few among the boxing fraternity that believe him.\nFabio Wardley, who intends to take the WBA route to a world title shot this year, says it is virtually \"impossible\" to predict what 36-year-old Fury will ultimately decide.\n\"Fury will probably wake up tomorrow morning and think about giving it another go and then go to bed having changed his mind,\" he said.\n\"I'm not entirely convinced that he's done but if he's finished, he has given us a great career and a fantastic record of fights to look back on.\"\nDubois v Parker - all you need to know\nBeterbiev v Bivol 2: Fight week begins\nJoshua, like many of his rivals, is biding his time. One thing we do know is the two-time heavyweight champion will carry on fighting after being knocked out by Dubois last September.\nHe has endless options, including Martin Bakole or Wilder, but it seems Joshua will focus his attention on fighting Fury or the winner of Dubois-Parker.\nBut it seems he will have competition because WBA, WBC, and WBO champion Usyk has said he would also want to fight the winner.\nShould Parker beat Dubois, Joshua would certainly not turn down the chance to become a three-time world champion against an opponent he has already beaten while Dubois would likely prioritise a rematch with Usyk over Joshua should he retain his title.\nAt 35, Joshua is in the latter stages of his career, but Wardley is convinced he can \"reach the heights\" he once did.\n\"He isn't done yet,\" Wardley said.\n\"Regardless of whether is Fury or not, there is more to give. There's more to prove to other people rather than more to achieve, maybe.\n\"He has done everything you can think of but in our own brains, us boxers are not always the most methodical.\n\"A lot of us make decisions on heart and instinct, and in his soul he may feel there is more to his career and legacy.\"\nAs for Usyk, the 38-year-old has said he expects to fight just twice more before retiring. \nIt appears to rule out a mooted return to cruiserweight to face the big-hitting Jai Opetaia, but don't expect any quick decisions from the Ukrainian.\nThe next big fight will likely be decided by the outcome of Dubois' title defence.\nA win for Dubois could lead towards a fight with Usyk, and another opportunity for a Briton to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999.\nA victory for Parker would derail those plans and open the door to a huge rematch, either against Dubois or Joshua.\nIt seems unlikely Usyk will be able to hold on to all three of his belts and a scattering of the titles would open the doors to a host of fights and potential new champions.\nElsewhere there are plenty of fights to make. Derek Chisora's final fight, Wardley and Itauma's next move and a perhaps rematch between Johnny Fisher and Dave Allen.\nClarke remains a dangerous prospect while the outcome of Whyte v Joyce could have a big impact on the division.\n\"The future in heavyweight boxing across the world is bright, but especially in the UK,\" Wardley said.\n\"We have Daniel, myself and Moses [Itauma] - it looks like we will have a strong grip on the division for the next coming years.\n\"It can be one of those golden eras where we all muck in, fight and get stuck in.\"\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Cole Palmer started as a false nine against Brighton, but struggled to influence the game\nBefore Friday's Premier League game against Brighton, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said they \"need to find something different\" without a genuine centre-forward currently available.\nAfter being thumped 3-0 while failing to muster a shot on target, presumably the Italian is still searching.\nDespite spending more than \u00a31.5bn since the Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly takeover went through less than three years ago, a recent injury crisis has left Chelsea's squad looking remarkably threadbare - none more so than up front.\nHow have they ended up with no fit strikers to call upon and how do they solve their problems in attack?\nChelsea have signed a lot of attacking players since the takeover.\nThe Blues have forked out \u00a3445m on forwards - but aside from a now-injured Nicolas Jackson none have proved to be a high-quality number nine.\nPierre Emerick Aubameyang was signed for former manager Thomas Tuchel at a cost of \u00a312m from Barcelona, but the veteran was frozen out soon after the German was sacked following a 100-day review from the ownership without a chance to prove his worth. He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".That all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.Latest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022How has Maresca tried to solve the problem?Maresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.The France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.He opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.But the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.As a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.They completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.Speaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. \"Related topicsChelseaPremier LeagueFootball \"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.",

        "article_text": "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nKendrick Lamar's most famous lyric was the heard around the world at last weekend's Super Bowl.\nAn estimated 127 million viewers saw the rapper flash a devious smile to the camera as he delivered the line - a withering takedown of bitter rival Drake.\nTaken from Grammy-winning track Not Like Us, it refers to accusations that the Canadian star had relationships with underage women - something he's denied.\nBut as 70,000 fans inside New Orlean's Caesars Superdome belted it out with him, it felt like Kendrick's winning play in the pair's long-running beef. \nIt's been public, personal and petty, but Kendrick has implied that he's waging a much wider war. \nNot just against Drake, but against what he represents.\n\"Drake is the face of the hip-hop scene as it is,\" says Margs, a London rapper who hosts rap battles on his channel Pen Game. \nThe Canadian is a huge commercial success - the most streamed artist of the 2010s, 143 million Instagram followers and a fixture on party playlists and nightclub set lists.\nHis style is melodic and accessible. He sings. \nIn other words, he's as much a pop star as he is a rapper. And where Drake goes, others follow.\n\"A lot of people see him as being responsible for the watering down of the product,\" says Margs.\n\"There's people that like the commercial side of music that just want to dance and enjoy themselves and it have no substance to it. \n\"And then there's the other side which is deep-rooted in the hip-hop culture.\"\nIt's a culture Kendrick wants to defend and celebrate.\nSpeaking before the Super Bowl show, he said the \"grit\" had gone from the genre. \n\"When people talk about rap, the conversations I'm hearing, they think it's just rapping, it's not an actual art form,\" he said.\nKendrick also took issue with rap being \"minimised to a catchy song or verse\", and said his feud with Drake actually came \"more from a space of more people putting rap to the back\".\n\"You didn't see that grit, you didn't see that bite any more. So I always took that into consideration with my music,\" he said.\nNot everyone agrees that a more mainstream-friendly version of rap makes Drake less credible.\nHis one-time rival Common recently defended him against the \"pop star\" label - saying that \"he's still an MC\" even though his songs are popular.\nKendrick, though, is passionate about rap as an artform, and said the success of Not Like Us and being chosen as the first solo hip-hop artist to front the halftime show \"meant everything\".\n\"To represent it on this type of stage is just everything that I've worked for and everything I believe in for the culture, I live and die by it,\" he said.\nHip-hop, a genre which has been around for 50 years, has a long history of protest.\nMargs says \"a lot of that has been lost\" when comparing current trends with the genre's origins.\n\"They cared about the message and what it stands for because hip-hop was something that was heavily politicised,\" he says.\n\"People used to use their voices in hip-hop to protest and get their messages out.\"\nThe political messaging in Kendrick's halftime show came from the start when actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as US government icon Uncle Sam, introduced the rapper.\nFrom there, it included references to the black power movement, imagery of a divided United States and, just before the finale, the line: \"This is bigger than the music.\"\nIt's a time of political change in the US following the re-election of Donald Trump, who was at the Super Bowl.\n\"There's no better time for people to stand on business and talk about things that matter,\" Margs says. \nKendrick - and his beef with Drake - also hark back to the origins of hip-hop in another way. \nHe's said he sees rap as a sport - and battle raps were his inspiration for the back-and-forth with Drake.\nThese face-offs - as seen in the Eminem film 8Mile - are where artists compete live, swapping disses and trying to spit the best bars to take home the prize.\nIt's rap in its purest form - substance over style and a focus on lyricism.\nKendrick said it's always been that way for him, and it's a vital part of finding the \"grit\" and \"bite\" he feels is missing.\n\"I still watch battle raps, this has always been the core definition of who I am and it's been this way since day one,\" he said.\nMargs thinks Kendrick's success will shine a light on battle rap, but he acknowledges emerging rappers are now finding new ways to cut their teeth. \nAmong them is Layyah, who was the first female rapper to win The Rap Game UK.\nShe's Team Kendrick, but doesn't plan on following his example on battle rap. \nLayyah says rap artists she looks up to like Central Cee are \"definitely not battle rappers\" but have found success and respect through other routes. \n\"We have so many platforms,\" she says. \"It's more like who can make a great song and then who can make the best routine to it.\n\"If that goes viral then it's a great song, you don't really have to do the battle raps.\"\nMargs thinks that's \"taken away from the art form a little bit\".\n\"You can win a battle on social media just through popularity or being funny... whereas with battle rap it's all about your lyrics and your skill.\"\nAs for Kendrick's beef with Drake, it's stayed quiet since Not Like Us was released last summer.\nSome people took the \"Game Over\" at the end of Kendrick's Super Bowl set as the end of the battle, and Drake's just released Gimme a Hug.\nIn that he suggests he wants to put the beef behind him and \"get the party lit\".\nBut there's still an ongoing legal case over Not Like Us - with the potential of a bitter courtroom face-off.\nMargs says that's a big contrast to settling scores on the battle rap stage. \n\"There's a sportsmanship to it but never spills over into more than that,\" says Margs.\n\"After the fight, they always hug it out and show respect for their competitor.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues. \nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model. They've got some outstanding young German coaches. We have one coaching our national team, which is fantastic.\n\"What you see - and this is over the last 10 years - is that they have younger coaches who have been given opportunities in the Bundesliga.\n\"They've been more exposed to that level earlier, so maybe that's something we can look at. But, for me, it's not about the nationality of a manager, it's about the qualities that they bring.\"\nWith just 20 managerial spots available does the Premier League feel a bit of a closed shop?\n\"Sometimes,\" says Still. \"But it's difficult to sort of have a grasp or a proper sense of what the reality is.\n\"I don't know what those Premier League clubs are thinking. I don't know how they're working. I don't know what their next step in their recruitment process is.\n\"It's the best league in the world for a reason so you've got to be one of the best in the world and that's what I think we all aspire to do.\"\nRosenior sees it somewhat differently.\n\"I think it depends on what your ultimate goal is,\" he says. \"My ultimate goal isn't to be in the Premier League.\n\"I don't think football is a linear thing where you say, 'Right, I worked in the Championship, I'm going to go to the Premier League'.\n\"My ultimate goal is to be the best coach I can be and it's up to the decision makers at each football club to pick who they think the right coach is for their club.\"\nThere was a time when few British players ventured overseas, but the numbers are growing season upon season. Should British coaches seek to do similar?\n\"I think it's a great experience,\" says Still \"I think learning about different cultures, different ways of playing the game, different opposition, different players. I'd definitely encourage it because you open yourself up to a lot more.\"\nRosenior adds: \"It's not for me to say to anyone where they should take their careers. And it's not about nationality. It's just about being the best person you can be and working as hard as you can every day.\"\nBoth Rosenior and Still have worked exceptionally hard to get to where they are right now in their careers and the decisions they have made have set them on a collision course which will culminate, temporarily at least, at Lens' Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Sunday.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola describes him as a 'mini-Rodri' but could Nico Gonzalez end up having a huge impact on what is left of Manchester City's season?\nThe \u00a350m midfielder's impressive display on his Premier League debut, Saturday's 4-0 win over top-four rivals Newcastle, brought the Rodri comparison from his beaming manager and impressed former City defender Micah Richards, who analysed Gonzalez for MOTD2.\n\"Gonzalez gave City the control they have been missing, with and without the ball,\" said Richards.\n\"That made a massive difference to the whole team, and he was a positive influence on the players around him too.\"\nNext up is an even tougher test, but could the 23-year-old Spaniard have a similar effect against Real Madrid on Wednesday, and help City turn around a Champions League play-off tie where they trail 3-2 after the first leg?\n\"The balance of the team looks much, much better already with Gonzalez in it,\" Richards added.\n\"City have got players who can score goals and hurt Real, but he brings some stability behind them, which they will need if they are to manage the game in Madrid.\n\"Do they have more chance of beating Real with him in the starting XI? Without a doubt.\"\nGonzalez made his Premier League debut against Newcastle. He may have been described as being a 'mini-Rodri' but at 6ft 2in he is only one inch shorter than his new City team-mate\nOne of the re-occurring themes of City's calamitous campaign is how often they have been cut open on the counter-attack since Rodri was injured in September.\nGuardiola has tried plenty of other players in the number six role, without replacing Rodri's calm authority in the heart of midfield, which was a hallmark of his team and helped them win trophy after trophy.\nAgainst Newcastle, it was different. City often stopped breakaways early, in the opposition half, with Gonzalez - a former Barcelona trainee who arrived at Etihad Stadium from Porto at the end of the January transfer window - seeing the threat early and expertly pouncing to snuff it out.\nThis video can not be played\nGonzales was 'our mini-Rodri' during big Man City win - Guardiola\n\"I saw a couple of situations against Newcastle where, in previous games, City would have been in big trouble,\" Richards explained.\n\"In the past, they were playing the ball forward to the edge of the opposition box, losing it, then someone in midfield would get turned and suddenly the defence was having to drop back rapidly from the halfway line because the opposition were running through unchallenged.\n\"That did not happen on Gonzalez's watch because he did not just stop counter-attacks when they happened, he anticipated the danger so they never happened in the first place.\n\"In one of the clips I picked out for MOTD2, he starts sprinting forward to pick up the second ball before the Newcastle defender on the edge of their area has even headed clear.\n\"Gonzalez is not just sitting deep, waiting, instead he gets up the pitch and into the right position to stop a group of Newcastle players getting on the ball and springing a break.\nCity play a high ball up to Phil Foden but it is about to be headed away, beyond Foden and Erling Haaland who is stood by the referee. Gonzalez (highlighted) has already started running to where he thinks the ball will go...\n... Gonzalez is right, and he collects the ball before three Newcastle players can react and quickly feeds it to Josko Gvardiol (number 24) to his left\n\"That was not the only time he made a difference defensively.\n\"There was another clip I chose from the Newcastle game which was a mirror image of how City conceded their second goal against Juventus in their Champions League defeat in Turin in December.\n\"A City attack had just broken down and Ilkay Gundogan, who was playing as the deepest midfielder, got pulled across to the right, leaving a big hole in the middle for Juve to drive through, with only the defence to deal with it.\nAgainst Juve, Gundogan was drawn over to cover behind Kyle Walker (number 2) who is the City player nearest the ball on the right...\n... but Juve quickly switched the ball into the space inside, and drove forward. Rico Lewis has come inside from the left, leaving space on his flank - where the cross for Juve's second goal comes from\n\"This time, however, Gonzalez leaves the runner to his left and he is not worried about him. Instead he reads the play and - bam! - he goes straight in for the challenge in the centre of the pitch to stop the counter. \n\"It's perfect midfield play, because he does not jump too early either. His timing is excellent, and he gets the ball back, with energy and purpose.\"\nAgainst Newcastle, Gonzalez leaves his man, who is running out to the right and switches his attention to the Newcastle players in the centre...\n... this time, when Newcastle play the ball inside, there is no gap for them to run through. Gonzalez reads the danger and is across to engage and win the ball back for City \nGonzalez was forced off injured on his City debut, last week's FA Cup win at Leyton Orient. He was hurt when he was caught on the ball, seconds before Jamie Donley's stunning long-range strike, which cannoned off the bar and went in via Stefan Ortega, put the home side ahead.\nOn Saturday, he lasted the full match, topping the ranking from both teams for most touches [114] and passes [103], with a 97% success rate.\nGonzalez attempted 103 passes against Newcastle, and completed 100 of them. He played 15 passes into the final third, more than any other player\nHis careful use of the ball helped give City the control of possession that Guardiola craves - they enjoyed 62% of it against the Magpies - but he was brave with his distribution too.\n\"There were times when Gonzalez took out three or four Newcastle players with one pass forward,\" Richards added. \"That's another thing City have been missing when they are starting attacks, or facing packed defences, someone who can break the lines from deep like that.\n\"Most of the time, though, you might have looked at his passing and think well he is actually not doing anything special. He was just in the right position, recycling the ball and keeping things moving.\n\"Again, though, that's exactly what City have needed this season, because there have been too many games where they have not starved the opposition of the ball the way they would in the past.\n\"I loved how Gonzalez has got the personality to come to the Premier League and play like this, straight away, against a team renowned for their physicality and intensity in midfield.\n\"As well as character, he also had the intelligence to know when to take a chance, and when to just hold on to the ball. Having someone with that kind of football IQ in your team is priceless.\"\nIt was striking to see exactly where Gonzalez got on the ball, with none of his touches taking place in the final third of the pitch.\nFor Richards, that was further evidence that he was constantly thinking about his role in the side, and also showed how he might think differently to Mateo Kovacic and Ilkay Gundogan, who have both filled in for Rodri as a defensive midfielder but had to wrestle with their attacking instincts.\n\"I think Gonzalez can get forward and into the box if he wants to,\" Richards added. \"Rodri always did that too - he scored nine goals last season.\n\"But on Saturday he wasn't worried about getting forward, he was just thinking about what was best for the team - looking at where the space was and filling the gaps at the right moments in midfield, whether City had the ball or not.\n\"That was great for his team-mates, because they knew they had him giving that protection behind them, and it particularly benefited Rico Lewis.\n\"Without Rodri alongside him, Rico has often seemed like he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. While his form has not been at the level we saw when he first broke into the team, he has found the role that Pep asks him to perform much more difficult this season.\n\"When City play with four at the back and Lewis is right-back, he is asked to come inside to create an overload in midfield.\nGraphic showing the average position of touches by each Manchester City player against Newcastle on Saturday. Nico Gonzales is number 14 and Rico Lewis is number 82\n\"Without Rodri, and before Gonzalez signed, Lewis was coming into midfield too early, and getting stuck in those central areas. Against Newcastle, however, he had Gonzalez behind him and it allowed him to get forward quicker, and give City more options out wide on the right.\n\"On top of that, Gonzalez helped Lewis defensively too, although City's dominance against Newcastle meant this was not as easy to spot.\n\"Lewis is still a defender, first and foremost, so when City have been losing the ball in the areas I spoke about earlier, he has to decide whether to get back in his right-back slot, or stay in midfield.\n\"It actually happened on the opposite flank for the Juventus goal I mentioned earlier, when he was at left-back but came across into midfield and left space out wide. With Rodri there, he does not have to come inside when attacks break down, and the same applies with Gonzalez in the team too.\n\"I loved the way Gonzalez seemed aware of exactly where to be at all times, and he also had the legs to get there quickly when he had to.\n\"That energy and physicality is something else City have lacked in their midfield, and it is another reason he looks like a gem of a player, who was the perfect signing for Pep.\n\"Going forward, he's going to be an important player alongside Rodri, not just instead of him. \n\"He definitely gives City more hope against Madrid, too. They are not the favourites, but of course they still have a chance of getting through.\"",

Somebody has worked hard to get it good,\" she said.\n\"I think if they just add a little more honesty when they are visiting these places, I think that is definitely needed.\"\nAshley French, an owner of the restaurants French Village and Orto in Belfast, said that influencers are a \"mixed bag\".\n\"It depends who it is really; there are ones who are genuine\u2026 then you have others who are potentially just wanting an invite to the opening of an envelope,\" he said.\nMr French said that while his restaurants will often be visited by influencers, he doesn't invite them or offer them payment or a discounted meal.\n\"Our feeling is that we would rather look after the paying public\".\nHe said that people are more likely to decide to eat at his restaurants based on word of mouth than social media.\nJohnny Mooney and Ben Kane, the content creators behind @foodandcraic, told BBC News NI that they \"definitely\" don't consider themselves food critics.\nMr Kane said they make videos purely \"to talk highly about places that we enjoy\".\n\"If we don't enjoy the experience, we don't post it,\" Mr Mooney added. \n\"Our content allows you to visually see what you're getting... so the opinion you'll form from our content will probably be more well-rounded than from written [content],\" he said.\nMs Jackson said branded is \"very important\" to help influencers \"stay afloat\".\nBut she added that she won't recommend something that she didn't enjoy in paid-for reviews.\nEd Senior, a compliance executive at the Advertising Standards Agency, told BBC News NI that the \"whole point\" of influencer marketing is that people can \"produce advertising in a style that they know their followers connect with because it's the same as their editorial content\".\n\"For us that's why it's exceptionally important that actually when it is advertising that it's absolutely clear that it's disclosed as such,\" he added.\nHe said that if a brand asks a creator to make content and pays them either with money or with a free or discounted meal, then it should be classified as advertising. \nHe said that once something is disclosed as advertising, it also needs to meet certain regulations, including whether it is \"accurate and fair\".\nAlongside work educating creators, Mr Senior said that \"targeted enforcement action, when necessary against those [creators] who are established, helps to bring about compliance from the sector as a whole\".",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

        "article_text": "David Moyes has led Everton to four wins in six league games since returning to the club\nOne point clear of the Premier League relegation zone and with just three wins in 19 matches, Everton were in a perilous position when David Moyes was reappointed as manager on 11 January.\nA little over a month later, however, the Merseyside club are suddenly the in-form team in the top flight.\nSaturday's victory at Crystal Palace means Moyes has picked up 13 points since returning to Goodison Park - with no team having secured more in that time (Arsenal are also on 13).\nThe Scot's tally of four wins in six league matches is also more than his predecessor Sean Dyche managed in the 19 games before his dismissal.\nThat stunning resurgence has lifted Everton 13 points above the bottom three, and only seven points below the top half, with 13 games of the 2024-25 season left to play.\nIt would take an extraordinary set of results for the Toffees to slip back into the relegation picture, and fans can surely start to look forward to watching top-flight football at their new stadium on Bramley Moore Dock next season.\n\"It was a great win because for large parts we weren't at our best,\" Moyes told BBC Match of the Day after the 2-1 victory at Selhurst Park. \"I thought Crystal Palace were on top, but thankfully we got the three points.\n\"Everton have had a difficult period, but I certainly think there's light at the end of the tunnel now.\"\nAlcaraz scores late winner for Everton at Palace\nThis video can not be played\nLight at end of tunnel for Everton - Moyes on new owners\nEven the most optimistic Everton supporters could not have expected such a remarkable revival under Moyes, who took charge of more than 500 games during an 11-year spell at the club between 2002 and 2013.\nBefore his return, the Toffees had managed only 15 goals in 19 league matches - the fourth-lowest tally in their history - while their expected goals (xG) tally of 18.33 was the lowest in the division.\nIn just six league games under Moyes they have already managed 12 goals - from an xG of 8.12.\nThat improvement is made all the more impressive by a personnel crisis that left them without nine first-team players against Palace, including Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Iliman Ndiaye and the suspended Abdoulaye Doucoure - who missed the trip to London after his celebrations in front of Liverpool supporters led to him being shown a red card at the end of Wednesday's dramatic Merseyside derby draw.\n\"Since the manager has come in we have definitely improved,\" defender James Tarkowski told Sky Sports. \"Winning and scoring goals brings [the belief] back.\n\"We were low on numbers today, with all the emotions of Wednesday [but] we stuck at it and got the win.\"\nWhen asked to shed light on Everton's upturn in form, Moyes said: \"I don't know if there's any secret. Sometimes in football you're given opportunities and you have to take your chance.\n\"There's a much better togetherness with the supporters and the players. This is certainly a club which thrives off its support.\n\"Hopefully we're getting them all back on side again.\"\nNo player epitomises the Toffees' improvement quite like Beto, who continued his fine form with another goal at Selhurst Park.\nThe Guinea-Bissau striker's opener in south London was his fourth goal in three league games - as many as he managed in 42 matches under Dyche.\nThe 27-year-old joined Everton from Udinese in August 2023 for a fee reportedly worth up to \u00a330m, but scored only three goals in 30 top-flight appearances as he struggled to adjust to life in England.\nAfter opening his account for the 2024-25 campaign in a 1-1 draw with Fulham in October, Beto then went nine league games without a goal before netting a double at home to Leicester City earlier this month.\nHe sent Goodison Park wild with a calmly taken opener in the derby before opening the scoring at Palace with a similarly composed finish.\nWith a hamstring injury ruling out Calvert-Lewin for the rest of the season, Beto could hardly have picked a better time to hit a purple patch.\n\"What a week it has been,\" Beto said in an interview with Match of the Day. \"I'm happy to score, [as] last season I wasn't so confident.\n\"Now I feel all my training, all my mental work and all the work I do with my team-mates is paying off. I believe that I belong in the Premier League and I'm a Premier League player.\"\nHis goalscoring exploits have delighted his manager, who believes the forward is still \"getting better\" as Everton climb the table.\n\"His chances have come through injuries [to other players],\" Moyes said. \"He probably saw a chance to play half a dozen games or so.\n\"It was down to him to show if he was capable.

        "summary": "'What a week' - in-form Everton's revival under Moyes keeps rollingImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, David Moyes has led Everton to four wins in six league games since returning to the clubMatthew HowarthBBC Sport journalistPublished15 February 2025691 CommentsOne point clear of the Premier League relegation zone and with just three wins in 19 matches, Everton were in a perilous position when David Moyes was reappointed as manager on 11 January.A little over a month later, however, the Merseyside club are suddenly the in-form team in the top flight.Saturday's victory at Crystal Palace means Moyes has picked up 13 points since returning to Goodison Park - with no team having secured more in that time (Arsenal are also on 13).The Scot's tally of four wins in six league matches is also more than his predecessor Sean Dyche managed in the 19 games before his dismissal.That stunning resurgence has lifted Everton 13 points above the bottom three, and only seven points below the top half, with 13 games of the 2024-25 season left to play.It would take an extraordinary set of results for the Toffees to slip back into the relegation picture, and fans can surely start to look forward to watching top-flight football at their new stadium on Bramley Moore Dock next season. \"Alcaraz scores late winner for Everton at PalaceToffees rediscovering scoring touchThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Light at end of tunnel for Everton - Moyes on new ownersEven the most optimistic Everton supporters could not have expected such a remarkable revival under Moyes, who took charge of more than 500 games during an 11-year spell at the club between 2002 and 2013.Before his return, the Toffees had managed only 15 goals in 19 league matches - the fourth-lowest tally in their history - while their expected goals (xG) tally of 18.33 was the lowest in the division.In just six league games under Moyes they have already managed 12 goals - from an xG of 8.12.That improvement is made all the more impressive by a personnel crisis that left them without nine first-team players against Palace, including Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Iliman Ndiaye and the suspended Abdoulaye Doucoure - who missed the trip to London after his celebrations in front of Liverpool supporters led to him being shown a red card at the end of Wednesday's dramatic Merseyside derby draw. \"In-form Beto firing when it mattersNo player epitomises the Toffees' improvement quite like Beto, who continued his fine form with another goal at Selhurst Park.The Guinea-Bissau striker's opener in south London was his fourth goal in three league games - as many as he managed in 42 matches under Dyche.The 27-year-old joined Everton from Udinese in August 2023 for a fee reportedly worth up to \u00a330m, but scored only three goals in 30 top-flight appearances as he struggled to adjust to life in England.After opening his account for the 2024-25 campaign in a 1-1 draw with Fulham in October, Beto then went nine league games without a goal before netting a double at home to Leicester City earlier this month.He sent Goodison Park wild with a calmly taken opener in the derby before opening the scoring at Palace with a similarly composed finish.With a hamstring injury ruling out Calvert-Lewin for the rest of the season, Beto could hardly have picked a better time to hit a purple patch. \"Everton's league results since Moyes' return15 January: Everton 0-1 Aston Villa19 January: Everton 3-2 Tottenham25 January: Brighton 0-1 Everton1 February: Everton 4-0 Leicester12 February: Everton 2-2 Liverpool15 February: Crystal Palace 1-2 EvertonRelated topicsPremier LeagueEvertonFootballMore on this storyLatest Everton news, analysis and fan viewsGet Everton news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022 \"When asked to shed light on Everton's upturn in form, Moyes said: \"I don't know if there's any secret.",

        "article_text": "A star-studded cast have taken part in a three-hour special to celebrate the 50th anniversary of legendary US comedy show Saturday Night Live.\nThe SNL50 show took place on Sunday (not Saturday) - but it was live, as always, from Studio 8H in New York City's Rockefeller Centre.\nThe programme, famed for its sketches and celebrity hosts, premiered in October 1975 and is responsible for launching the careers of comedy legends including Eddie Murphy and Bill Murray.\nSome returned for the anniversary special, alongside younger acts. Here are some of the highlights:\nWoman of the moment Sabrina Carpenter kicked off the show by performing a duet alongside Paul Simon of folk rock duo Simon and Garfunkel. The pair sang a rendition of the band's 1966 hit Homeward Bound.\nSimon first appeared on the comedy series back in 1976, singing the same song with The Beatles' George Harrison.\nEspresso singer Carpenter joked that neither she nor her parents had been born then.\nNirvana returned to the stage with surprise guest Post Malone - introduced by actor Adam Sandler. The actor reminisced about the original bandmates' last SNL performance with frontman Kurt Cobain shortly before his death.\nPost Malone joined Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear to play the band's iconic hit Smells Like Teen Spirit.\nIt came after the surviving members of the 90s rock band reunited for another special performance last month to raise money for the LA fires relief fund.\nSNL's jokes regularly centre around politics or news events, so it seemed unlikely that one of the most high-profile current celebrity showdowns - between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively - would be spared.\nThe It Ends With Us stars are currently embroiled in a bitter legal dispute, with a court date set for 2026.\nIn what appeared to be a reference to the drama, Lively's husband (who is also named in the complaint) Ryan Reynolds was part of a Q&A in which Tina Fey and Amy Poehler appeared on stage to take questions from the audience.\nAsked how he was doing, Reynolds replied \"Great!\" Then, seeming concerned, he asked: \"Why, what have you heard?\"\nUS actress Aubrey Plaza made one of her first public appearances since the death of her husband.\nDirector and screenwriter Jeff Baena died in January at the age of 47. The pair had been together for more than a decade and married in 2021.\nOn Sunday, Plaza popped up in the audience to introduce Miley Cyrus and Brittany Howard for a performance of Sinead O'Connor's Nothing Compares 2 U. \nShe paid tribute to Baena wearing a tie-dye shirt - it is unclear if it belonged to him but the couple wore tie-dye outfits for their wedding after the director got into the hobby during Covid.\nAn almost unrecognisable Meryl Streep made her SNL debut in a sketch hitting on Pedro Pascal and calling her character a \"bad girl\".\nShe also referenced her iconic film in which she played fierce fashion boss Miranda Priestly, joking: \"This devil wears nada.\"\nWhat would this special be without a face from the very first season of the show? It was fitting for Garrett Morris, an original cast member and the first black person on set of Saturday Night Live, to return to the studio.\nHe started the sketch declaring \"I am Garrett Morris\" to a big cheer, and joked that back when he joined the cast he had \"no idea ya'll that I would be required to do so many reunion shows\".\nDomingo was back. There was no surprise that arguably the most viral character of the last season would return for this special.\nPreviously, we saw him at the wedding of Kelsey and Matt, when her bridesmaids revealed in a musical ensemble that she had been having an affair with Domingo.\nOn the anniversary special, Domingo's brothers turned up at the couple's vow renewal. Santiago, aka musician Bad Bunny, and Reynaldo, played by Pedro Pascal, joined in when the groomsmen formed their own ensemble.\nIt was revealed, this time round, that Matt and Santiago had got to know one another.\nThe last time Kim Kardashian was on SNL, she made headlines for kissing comedian Pete Davidson on Aladdin's magic carpet - a kiss that was rumoured to be the start of their relationship.\nOn Sunday, Kardashian returned for an updated version of the singing Maharelle Sisters with former cast members Ana Gasteyer, Kristen Wiig and Scarlett Johansson - whose husband is the regular \"Weekend Update\" anchor Colin Jost.\nIntroduced by his rarely seen Anger Management co-star Jack Nicholson, actor Adam Sandler sang about the show's history. \nHe gave a long list of previous cast members, noting several who had died including veteran SNL-ers Chris Farley and Norm MacDonald along with Gilda Radner, Jan Hooks and Phil Hartman.\nTom Hanks, wearing a black suit and tie, aptly performed a spoof segment named \"In Memoriam\".\nHe introduced a tribute to \"SNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly\", describing the subsequent montage as \"unquestionably in poor taste\".\nHe pointed out to the audience in spite of that: \"You all laughed at them. So if anyone should be cancelled, shouldn't it be you the audience? Something to think about.\"",

If untreated, it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis C cause inflammation of the liver and come from viral infections, according to the NHS. Both can be contracted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.  \nOpt-out testing for blood-borne viruses has been seen by health officials and ministers as a resounding success for the NHS, which has not yet released the names of the latest hospitals added to the scheme.\nThe BBC understands health leaders hope to expand opt-out testing to detect more diseases in the future. \nSean Connaughton, from London, told the BBC he would \"have been dead\" had it not been for the opt-out testing. \nHe is one of the hundreds of people to discover they were living with HIV after being diagnosed through the scheme.\nHe attended hospital in October 2023 after suffering from seizures and losing 20kg (44lbs) through repeated sickness.\n\"Unless I had gone to A&E and I had done that test, my diagnosis would never have been known,\" Mr Connaughton said.\nWithout a diagnosis, doctors told him \"some of the other infections I had would have gone into my spine and into my brain\", he told the BBC.\n\"Two days prior to being admitted, I'd had a seizure in the bathroom and smashed my head into the basin and passed out, so the body was already breaking at that point. \n\"I wouldn't have survived, I don't think, another couple of weeks, if I hadn't been tested.\"\nRichard Angell, the chief executive of sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said opt-out testing was a \"win-win for everyone\".\n\"The benefit of opt-out testing is that you can get a test to people that would otherwise never come forward for a HIV test,\" Mr Angell said.\nHe added \"that means a transformation for the individual\" who can begin to take medication, which \"means the virus is no longer attacking their immune system and they can't pass it on if they're having sex or having a baby\".\nMr Angell said early testing also makes \"good money sense for the NHS\" as it allows early treatment, which stops HIV progressing, preventing severe illness, emergency visits and more costly treatments.\nThe testing forms part of a pledge by Sir Keir Starmer to eliminate new transmissions of HIV by 2030.\nEarlier this week, Sir Keir became the first sitting prime minister to publicly take an HIV test.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

We knew Huddersfield were going to push us right to the end and I saw the gap in the line, so I had to back myself.\n\"Round one's never pretty \u2013 you'd like to think you've got all the cobwebs out in pre-season. We haven't really had a side that's played 80 minutes yet, with people in and out through trials.\n\"I thought we were a bit clunky first half, we lacked a bit of direction and we got that sorted at half-time and ran a lot more smoothly.\n\"It comes down to the effort areas, staying connected through the whole game. We had a new structure come in last year so we've already got that in place and moving forward we can build on what we had last year.\"\nHuddersfield Giants head coach Luke Robinson told BBC 5Live Sports Extra:\n\"We've had really freakish injuries, so it's been a torrid pre-season for us. Someone's got a voodoo doll with my face on it and they're prodding needles in it all the time.\n\"I'm extremely proud of each and every one of them, one to 17. Effort-wise, they were brilliant, they did everything we asked of them and stuck together.\n\"The one thing I am a little bit disappointed with is the game management. At the end of the first half they had loads of sets on our goal-line and we worked extremely hard, got the ball back and pretty much gifted them a try.\n\"If we'd just reacted a bit differently in some key moments, it could have been a different result. But if we put that much effort and desire in, we'll get some points on the board.\"\nHuddersfield: Gagai; Swift, Hewitt, Jake Bibby, Wallis; Lolohea, Richardson; Wilson, Woolford, Burgess, Murchie, Greenwood, Cudjoe.\nInterchanges: Golding, English, Rogers, Rushton; Jack Bibby.\nWarrington: Dufty; Thewlis, Lindop, King, Ashton; Williams, Ratchford; Vaughan, Walker, Yates, Holroyd, Russell, Currie.\nInterchanges: Powell, Crowther, Musgrove, Philbin; Taylor-Wray.\nReferee: Tom Grant",

Warrington fight back to seal win at HuddersfieldImage source, SWPixImage caption, Toby King's second-half try gave Warrington some breathing space against HuddersfieldPublished16 February 2025, 16:57 GMT43 CommentsUpdated 5 hours agoBetfred Super LeagueHuddersfield (6) 12Tries: Lolohea, Greenwood Goals: Richardson 2Warrington (4) 20Tries: Lindop, Ashton, King, Dufty Goals: Ratchford, ThewlisWarrington Wolves recovered from a sluggish first-half display to hold off Huddersfield Giants as they opened their Super League campaign with victory at John Smith's Stadium.Sam Burgess' side looked untidy at the start and fell behind when Tui Lolohea marked his 250th career appearance with the game's opening score.Arron Lindop's try on the stroke of half-time revitalised the visitors and they seemed to be firmly in control after Matty Ashton and Toby King both crossed the line.Joe Greenwood scrambled over to reduce the gap to two points, but the Giants' hopes were finally extinguished as Matt Dufty scampered on to his own kick for Warrington's fourth try.Huddersfield, who gave debuts to four players, opted to kick long and put the Wolves defence under pressure but, although those tactics paid off in terms of possession, the scoreboard remained blank for 25 minutes.Wire appeared rusty, with several passes going astray and also lost their captain's challenge inside 10 minutes with a failed attempt to overturn a Giants seven-tackle set after George Williams' kick in-goal was caught by Lolohea.It was the Tonga international stand-off who opened the home side's account for the season, collecting a looped pass from Zac Woolford and bursting clear to dive over on the right, with Danny Richardson adding the extras.Huddersfield's captain's challenge also failed after they were penalised for a steal close to their own line \u2013 but the visitors failed to take advantage, choosing to tap and run only for the move to flounder with Stefan Ratchford's knock-on.However, the visitors hit back with the final action of the first period, retrieving possession after Lolohea's pass thudded off Greenwood's chest and Lindop held off his man to score in the corner.Although Ratchford's awkward conversion attempt drifted fractionally wide, the try itself was enough to give Warrington a boost and they carried that momentum through into the second period.Dufty fed Ashton to exploit gaps in the Huddersfield defence and put his side in front for the first time, with centre King scooting over soon afterwards to stretch the Wolves' advantage to 14-6.Sandwiched between those tries, the Giants were unable to take advantage of Greenwood's 40-metre charge following an interception \u2013 but the second row did later narrow the deficit, bundling the ball over the line for a try confirmed by video referee Aaron Moore.Huddersfield's hopes of a late comeback never materialised, though, and Dufty made the points safe with five minutes remaining, following his own close-range kick through to score.Warrington Wolves full-back Matt Dufty told BBC 5Live Sports Extra:\"It was a tough-fought win. \"The one thing I am a little bit disappointed with is the game management. \"Round one's never pretty \u2013 you'd like to think you've got all the cobwebs out in pre-season. \"I thought we were a bit clunky first half, we lacked a bit of direction and we got that sorted at half-time and ran a lot more smoothly.",

        "article_text": "The UN climate summit in the United Arab Emirates in 2023 ended with a call to \"transition away from fossil fuels\". It was applauded as a historic milestone in global climate action.\nBarely a year later, however, there are fears that the global commitment may be losing momentum, as the growth of clean energy transition is slowing down while burning of fossil fuels continues to rise.\nAnd now there is US President Donald Trump's \"national energy emergency\", embracing fossil fuels and ditching clean energy policies  \u2013 that has also begun to influence some countries and energy companies already.\nIn response to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan aimed at ramping up fossil fuel extraction, and the US notifying the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Indonesia, for instance, has hinted that it may follow suit.\n\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara. \nIndonesia has remained in the list of top 10 carbon-emitting countries for years now.\n\"Indonesia produces three tons of carbon [per person a year] while the US produces 13 tons,\" he asked at the ESG Sustainable Forum 2025 in Jakarta on 31 January.\n\"Yet we are the ones being told to close our power plants... So, where is the sense of justice here?\" \nNithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.\nShe said the \"richest country and the largest oil producer in the world\" increasing its production gives other states \"an easy excuse to increase their own - which they are already doing\".\nIn South Africa, Africa's biggest economy and a major carbon emitter, a $8.5bn foreign-aided transition project from the coal sector was already moving at a snail's pace, and now there are fears that it may get derailed further.\nWikus Kruger, director of Power Futures Lab at the University of Cape Town, said there was a \"possibility\" that decommissioning of old coal-fired power stations would be \"further delayed\".\nHowever he said that while there was some \"walk back\" from transition to renewables, there was still growth in the clean energy sector that was expected to continue.\nArgentina withdrew its negotiators from the COP29 climate meeting in Baku last November, days after Trump won the US presidency. It has since followed Trump's lead in signalling it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement of 2015 - which underpins global efforts to combat climate change.\n\"We now expect our oil and gas production to go up,\"  Enrique Viale, president of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers, told the BBC.\n\"President Milei has hinted that he intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and has said environmentalism is part of the woke agenda.\"\nMeanwhile, energy giant Equinor has just announced it is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production,  and another oil major, BP, is expected to make a similar announcement soon.\nTrump has not just said \"drill, baby, drill\" but also: \"We will export American energy all over the world.\"\nPotential foreign buyers are already lining up.\nIndia and the US have agreed to significantly increase the supply of American oil and gas to the Indian market.\nAt the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".\nA few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.\nOfficials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.\nScientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.\n\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.\n\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"\nGlobal energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels.",

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

        "article_text": "Thousands of Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers are logging off during peak hours on Valentine's Day in a campaign for better pay and working conditions, a union says.\nThe strike action is taking place across the UK from 16:00 to 22:00 GMT.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would unite \"drivers up and down the country faced with low pay and insecure conditions\". \nUber, Bolt and Addison and Lee have defended their working conditions after the IWGB said drivers in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Brighton were backing the strike.\nVasilica Dumitrescu has been working for various platforms, including Uber and Bolt, for the last nine years. The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

If untreated, it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis C cause inflammation of the liver and come from viral infections, according to the NHS. Both can be contracted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.  \nOpt-out testing for blood-borne viruses has been seen by health officials and ministers as a resounding success for the NHS, which has not yet released the names of the latest hospitals added to the scheme.\nThe BBC understands health leaders hope to expand opt-out testing to detect more diseases in the future. \nSean Connaughton, from London, told the BBC he would \"have been dead\" had it not been for the opt-out testing. \nHe is one of the hundreds of people to discover they were living with HIV after being diagnosed through the scheme.\nHe attended hospital in October 2023 after suffering from seizures and losing 20kg (44lbs) through repeated sickness.\n\"Unless I had gone to A&E and I had done that test, my diagnosis would never have been known,\" Mr Connaughton said.\nWithout a diagnosis, doctors told him \"some of the other infections I had would have gone into my spine and into my brain\", he told the BBC.\n\"Two days prior to being admitted, I'd had a seizure in the bathroom and smashed my head into the basin and passed out, so the body was already breaking at that point. \n\"I wouldn't have survived, I don't think, another couple of weeks, if I hadn't been tested.\"\nRichard Angell, the chief executive of sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said opt-out testing was a \"win-win for everyone\".\n\"The benefit of opt-out testing is that you can get a test to people that would otherwise never come forward for a HIV test,\" Mr Angell said.\nHe added \"that means a transformation for the individual\" who can begin to take medication, which \"means the virus is no longer attacking their immune system and they can't pass it on if they're having sex or having a baby\".\nMr Angell said early testing also makes \"good money sense for the NHS\" as it allows early treatment, which stops HIV progressing, preventing severe illness, emergency visits and more costly treatments.\nThe testing forms part of a pledge by Sir Keir Starmer to eliminate new transmissions of HIV by 2030.\nEarlier this week, Sir Keir became the first sitting prime minister to publicly take an HIV test.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "Ukraine's future is the focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), just days after a shock phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the Ukraine war.\nDescribing the call earlier this week as \"great\", Trump said there was a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war\". \nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country must not be left out of any peace talks.\nEuropean allies seemed surprised at the nature of the call, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning that any peace agreement which involved capitulating to Russia would end \"badly for everyone\".\nIt is still unclear when peace negotiations could begin, but when they do issues around territory, security negotiations and Ukraine's future in Nato will be among the key topics for discussion. Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "Peaky Blinders will continue beyond the upcoming film, says creator Steven Knight, sparking rumours of a potential new series.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, he said that work so far on The Immortal Man: A Peaky Blinders Film looks \"fantastic\" and will prove to be \"a very fitting way to end this part of the Peaky story.\"\nWhen quizzed on what he meant by \"this part\" by presenters Jon Kay and Sarah Campbell, Knight added: \"It's not over, let's just put it like that. I'm not allowed to announce it... but I'm just saying that the world of Peaky will continue.\"\nThe writer and producer was appearing on the show to promote his new Disney+ period drama, A Thousand Blows, starring Stephen Graham.\nThere have been six series of the Bafta-winning hit BBC TV show Peaky Blinders, from 2013-2022, with the upcoming Netflix film continuing the story of Tommy Shelby and his Birmingham crime gang.\nIt will see Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy reprise his lead role alongside an ensemble cast including Graham, Sophie Rundle, Ned Dennehy, Packy Lee and Ian Peck; as well as Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth, Jay Lycurgo, and Barry Keoghan.\n\"I think we've got the best British actors all in one place, including Stephen,\" noted Knight.\n\"The stuff that I'm watching, the rushes... no-one will be disappointed.\n\"It is quite an incredible thing.\"\nSpeaking on the breakfast sofa, Knight also described himself as a \"BBC loyalist\", despite the fact his new period drama A Thousand Blows is launching on Disney+.\nIn his latest creation, Graham stars as notorious boxer Sugar Goodson making his way in the dangerous world of illegal boxing in 1880s Victorian London.\nIt follows the tale of two friends from Jamaica, Hezekiah Moscow (Small Axe star Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), who find themselves thrust into the capital's bare-knuckle boxing scene.\nIt's here that Hezekiah meets Mary Carr (The Crown star Erin Doherty), queen of an all-female criminal gang known as the Forty Elephants,  who hopes to use his talents to her and her gang's advantage. \nAsked by BBC Radio 4's Today presenter Nick Robinson if this type of show could still be made by the BBC, Knight replied: \"Peaky is a BBC show and there was no issue with making that at the BBC. I'm a huge BBC loyalist, as I think you know.\n\"I love to work with the BBC creatively. There is no place like it.

        "article_text": "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the latest move in a row between the Trump administration and career US attorneys. \nSeven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case. \nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News on Friday that it was her understanding that the case against Adams would be \"dismissed today\". \nAdams was indicted last year on fraud and bribery charges. He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe request to drop the charges will require approval by a judge.\nEarlier in the week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove - Bondi's second-in-command - ordered the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office to end the case.\nBove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. \nThe motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case \"would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies\".\nBut several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.   \nSassoon resigned from her post on Thursday and was followed by six of her colleagues.\nShe said dropping the case would set a \"breathtaking and dangerous precedent\".\nThe latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for \"using prosecutorial power\" to influence elected officials.\n\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\nIn a letter accepting Sassoon's resignation, Bove said his office would be investigating the attorney, claiming she had \"lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice\". \nIn a statement, Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle defended the decision to dismiss the charges, saying it showed \"that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\".\nMr Mizelle said that prosecutors who refuse direct orders \"have no place\" in the department.\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. \nIn Sassoon's resignation letter, she also said  Adams' lawyers had met justice department officials and asked for a \"quid pro quo\", saying the New York City mayor could help enforce Trump's immigration policies if the case against him was dismissed.\nBut Adams denied that was the case. \n\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered - nor did anyone offer on my behalf - any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\nAdams, a Democrat, has accused investigators of pursuing a politically motivated case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\nThe New York mayor has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he won the White House. He flew to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida days before the Republican president took office. \nAfter a meeting with US border tsar Tom Homan on Thursday, Adams said he would agree to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to re-establish an office at the city's Rikers Island jail. \nTrump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the case against Adams. \nBut Bove's letter described his instructions to drop the case as \"direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\".\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.\nWhile she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was \"consulting with other leaders in government at this time\". \n\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious,\" she said. \"But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction.\"",

It's incredible.\"\nMoloney said he particularly enjoyed filming at the beaches in the west of the island.\nHe said: \"I loved filming in the gorgeous St Brelade's Bay, where we lucked out with some lovely August weather and we could swim at lunchtime and have ice cream.\n\"We had another great day on Gorey pier, and in the Driftwood Caf\u00e9 on Archirondel Beach, I loved that place.\"\nThe government, which committed \u00a31.2m to the reboot, said it hoped the series would boost tourism in the island.\nMoloney added: \"I think fans of the original series will love seeing Jersey back on their screens.\"\nZo\u00eb Wanamaker, who plays Charlie Hungerford, said she could \"see why people love it in Jersey\".\nShe said: \"The buildings are gorgeous, and I found out that a lot of them were constructed in the same way as Devon was built on hills in the 1800s. \n\"I also got to visit St Brelade's Bay Hotel, which is right next to another stunning beach - it was a busy summer's day when we were there, and I loved seeing so many families spending time in the sun.\"\nWanamaker said she had \"many friends\" who had featured in the original and that the new series was \"an emotional, challenging ride\".\nWriter Tom Whithouse said Jersey and Bergerac were \"utterly indivisible\".\n\"If you were setting it anywhere else it would have to be a different show. What is interesting about it is that it's a fascinating, strange, incredibly beautiful and very welcoming island,\" he said.\nWhithouse said he hoped fans would enjoy the remake.\nHe said: \"We've taken the fundamental elements from the original show - the rich John Nettles version of the character had a complexity and a darkness to him.\n\"He was always in the tradition of the maverick cop who found himself at odds with the system around him and found that frustrating, because underneath there was a pure drive to do his job and do it well.\"\nExecutive producer Clare Alan said in August that Jersey was \"a character within the series\".\nDirector Colm McCarthy said keeping the show based in Jersey made sense: \"Jersey, both as a location and a character in the story are a big part of what gives Bergerac its distinctive feel.\n\"It's very near to France, so it has this different feel to anywhere else in the UK, it's got a luxurious quality to it.\n\"But also, people come with their own baggage about the ideas of Jersey... all of those different facets give it a place, a feeling that is familiar because it's still British to a British television audience.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

The tribunal states that whether its decision has any benefit to the club, therefore, depends on whether the new APT rules are found to be lawful as part of the second challenge issued by the club last month. \n\"The League continues to believe that the new APT Rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter.\n\"The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to the Premier League for fair market value assessment.\"\nAPTs are commercial deals involving clubs and companies to which they have close ties. Restrictions on fair market values (FMVs) were introduced in December 2021, shortly after a Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle.\nThe Premier League has the right to assess the value of such deals to ensure they have not been inflated, which could give clubs more to spend under current financial rules.\nLast year, a tribunal ruled that low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the APTs. It also ruled that changes made to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\nFollowing the ruling, City criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion the regulations could be swiftly amended and said there should be no vote on changes before a further determination by the panel.\nHowever, in November, the Premier League voted through the amendments.\nThe Premier League said the rule changes related to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\nEarlier this month, City launched a fresh legal challenge, claiming the amendments are \"unlawful\".\nThe Premier League has already had to spend tens of millions of pounds on legal bills due to a range of recent disputes over its financial regulations. \nNow it faces the threat of further costs after a significant defeat that could lead to some clubs seeking compensation for what some sources believe could be dozens of commercial deals undervalued or rejected as a result of rules that have now been deemed to be unenforceable.\nWhile City feel vindicated by this ruling, the league's governance and ability to uphold its rulebook will now come under renewed scrutiny. But it could get worse for those in charge of the top-flight.\nIf the same arbitration panel decides that the amended set of rules are also void, the league could face a crisis.\nThere could be little preventing clubs like Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City and Saudi-owned Newcastle United from signing more lucrative deals with state-linked companies. While such clubs would welcome less restrictions on sponsorships and loans with 'associated parties', some rivals fear the league's competitive balance would be on the line.\nEnglish football is already braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the Premier League's separate disciplinary case against City.\nThe champions, who are facing 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches, deny any wrongdoing.\nBut the next few weeks could now feature another legal decision that also has a profound impact on the league's future direction.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. \n\"I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences.\"",

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodiverse people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's future is the focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), just days after a shock phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the Ukraine war.\nDescribing the call earlier this week as \"great\", Trump said there was a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war\". \nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country must not be left out of any peace talks.\nEuropean allies seemed surprised at the nature of the call, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning that any peace agreement which involved capitulating to Russia would end \"badly for everyone\".\nIt is still unclear when peace negotiations could begin, but when they do issues around territory, security negotiations and Ukraine's future in Nato will be among the key topics for discussion. Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "Cole Palmer started as a false nine against Brighton, but struggled to influence the game\nBefore Friday's Premier League game against Brighton, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said they \"need to find something different\" without a genuine centre-forward currently available.\nAfter being thumped 3-0 while failing to muster a shot on target, presumably the Italian is still searching.\nDespite spending more than \u00a31.5bn since the Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly takeover went through less than three years ago, a recent injury crisis has left Chelsea's squad looking remarkably threadbare - none more so than up front.\nHow have they ended up with no fit strikers to call upon and how do they solve their problems in attack?\nChelsea have signed a lot of attacking players since the takeover.\nThe Blues have forked out \u00a3445m on forwards - but aside from a now-injured Nicolas Jackson none have proved to be a high-quality number nine.\nPierre Emerick Aubameyang was signed for former manager Thomas Tuchel at a cost of \u00a312m from Barcelona, but the veteran was frozen out soon after the German was sacked following a 100-day review from the ownership without a chance to prove his worth. He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer.

Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".That all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.Latest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022How has Maresca tried to solve the problem?Maresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.The France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 league matches in all competitions.He opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.But the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.As a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.They completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.Speaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. \"Related topicsChelseaPremier LeagueFootball \"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.",

In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, which quickly became public, Sassoon said there was no legal justification for dismissing the case.\nShe made explosive allegations of a quid-pro-quo proposed by Adams' attorneys to the justice department, and said that the top official who ordered them to stop, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, had not provided sufficient legal justification for his actions.\nAdams and his attorney, Alex Spiro, have denied Sassoon's allegation.

She is a member of the Federalist Society, a professional group of conservative lawyers and scholars.\nShe prosecuted the fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, which resulted in a guilty verdict and a sentence of 25 years in prison.\n\"There was an abundance of evidence in that case and the outcome was expected by all, but it was complex and the prosecutors were very professional, organized and cogent,\" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School who followed the case closely.\nDespite her work on such high profile cases, Sassoon kept a low profile, as is typical for federal prosecutors.\nShe was temporarily leading the Southern District of New York, while Trump's choice for the top job, Jay Clayton, awaited US Senate confirmation. \nWith her conservative bona fides, she could have potentially found work in the new Republican administration.\nBut then came Bove's instruction to drop the corruption case against Adams, who was accused of accepting bribes and improper campaign contributions from foreign nationals. \nAdams has denied the claims and pleaded not guilty. His trial was set for April.\nSassoon's decision to defy orders, and reveal secretive justice department discussions on her way out the door, was extremely unusual, Manhattan attorneys said.\n\"This is the stuff you never see,\" said Arthur Aidala, a criminal defence attorney.\nThe justice department could still take retaliatory measures. \nIn his response to Sassoon, Bove wrote that he was putting assistant US attorneys involved in the Adams case on leave pending an investigation. He also said the justice department would \"evaluate your conduct\".\nBut New York lawyers say that Sassoon's act of defiance may have sprung from necessity as much as conviction.\n\"Both from a moral perspective and a practical perspective she had no choice,\" said Mark Zauderer, a high-profile appellate attorney. \"The office would have been in shambles.\"\nTo comply with Bove could have prompted a staff exodus and put the office's reputation at risk, he said.\nMs Cohen, who still considered Sassoon a friend, said she recalled the prosecutor as a staunch advocate for her colleagues.\n\"You can see that support in her decision to put the office, and her oath of office, at the forefront of her decision to resign,\" Ms Cohen said.",

He also said the justice department would \"evaluate your conduct\".\nBut New York lawyers say that Sassoon's act of defiance may have sprung from necessity as much as conviction.\n\"Both from a moral perspective and a practical perspective she had no choice,\" said Mark Zauderer, a high-profile appellate attorney. \"The office would have been in shambles.\"\nTo comply with Bove could have prompted a staff exodus and put the office's reputation at risk, he said.\nMs Cohen, who still considered Sassoon a friend, said she recalled the prosecutor as a staunch advocate for her colleagues.\n\"You can see that support in her decision to put the office, and her oath of office, at the forefront of her decision to resign,\" Ms Cohen said.",

Hagan Scotten, another federal prosecutor, wrote in his own resignation letter that he was \"entirely in agreement\" with Sassoon's decision not to drop the Adams case.Those who worked with Sassoon say they are not surprised she took this extraordinary stance.Carrie Cohen, a former colleague at the Southern District of New York, described her as \"an excellent, diligent, tough, but fair prosecutor, exactly the type of prosecutor that people should want serving their country\".On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James lauded Sassoon as a \"profile in courage\".Even those who worked against Sassoon's team of prosecutors in court praised her decision.Sassoon and her team were \"fierce advocates for the office\", said criminal defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman. \"On Thursday, Sassoon, who had served just three weeks as the interim head of the Southern District of New York offered the country a peek behind that curtain of power.The 38-year-old federal prosecutor resigned on Thursday, after refusing to comply with the Justice Department's order to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.She did not go quietly. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, which quickly became public, Sassoon said there was no legal justification for dismissing the case.She made explosive allegations of a quid-pro-quo proposed by Adams' attorneys to the justice department, and said that the top official who ordered them to stop, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, had not provided sufficient legal justification for his actions.Adams and his attorney, Alex Spiro, have denied Sassoon's allegation.

It's a difficult one.\"\nSinner was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol in March.\nWada had been seeking a ban of up to two years, having launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) following the 2024 decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to suspend Sinner.\nHowever, it reached a deal after accepting the player was inadvertently contaminated by a banned substance and \"did not intend to cheat\".\nWorld number 766 Broady said he was a \"little bit upset at the verdict\", adding that \"it doesn't seem like there's much being lost from this ban\".\n\"It does appear to be favouritism towards the better players on the tour,\" Broady added.\n\"I wouldn't say that he's done it on purpose, but if that had happened to another player, would we be treated the same way?

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodiverse people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

        "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney gives you his team and manager of the week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Brentford have been iffy but he was a huge part of why they were able to walk away with a 1-0 victory against West Ham. It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

America is still in Nato but Europe can no longer automatically rely on the US to come to its aid.\nIn Brussels, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Nato's European members to spend much more on defence, saying they would have to provide the \"overwhelming\" share of military funding for Ukraine.\nThe US and Russia are going to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, whether Europe and Ukraine like it or not. \nThe talks in Saudi Arabia will end a three-year freeze in talking to Vladimir Putin, despite urgent warnings by Kyiv that the Russian leader is not to be trusted.\nThey follow a phone call between Donald Trump and Putin on Wednesday.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, US officials said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly said he would not accept any deal struck without his country's input, said Kyiv had not been invited to the talks.\nEurope, everyone agrees, needs to rapidly raise its defence spending if it has any hope of deterring a newly emboldened Russia. \nThe current Nato-mandated minimum of 2% of GDP is likely to rise to 3%. Russia currently spends more than twice that on defence in percentage terms.\nIn January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income on defence. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending.\nBut Europe as a whole has already overtaken the US in terms of aid to Ukraine. In total, it has allocated \u20ac70bn ($73bn; \u00a358bn) in financial and humanitarian aid as well as \u20ac62bn in military aid. This compares to \u20ac64bn in military aid from the US as well as \u20ac50bn in financial and humanitarian allocations.\nUS Vice President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on Friday was called \"ill-judged\" and \"insulting\" by many of the delegates at the Munich Security Conference. \nThey had hoped he would reassure them the US was not abandoning Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. \nBut the speech appealed to others on both sides of the Atlantic and Donald Trump  called it \"brilliant\".\nWhile the Munich conference was occupied by the geopolitical, Donald Trump announced plans to bring in a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from March.\nIt was evidence there are now very obvious rifts between Washington's positions and Europe's on several issues, from trade to dealing with Russia. \nIt is a divide that the UK is struggling to bridge, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling reporters both relationships were important and Britain was \"not choosing between the US and the EU\". \nBut the Trump team's own messaging is sometimes contradictory, rowing back on grand pronouncements the day after they have been made.",

        "article_text": "Pope drama Conclave and immigration epic The Brutalist walked away with some of the biggest prizes at the Bafta film awards on Sunday.\nConclave, made by German director Edward Berger, picked up four awards in total including best film and best British film; the first time a movie has won both in the same year since the 2019 war drama, 1917. It also won best adapted screenplay and best editing.\nUS filmmaker Brady Corbet's The Brutalist also won four - Corbet picked up best director while Adrien Brody won best actor for his portrayal of Hungarian architect and Holocaust survivor,  L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th. The film also won best original score and cinematography.\nOther winners included Mikey Madison (best actress, for Anora), Kieran Culkin (best supporting actor, for A Real Pain) and Zoe Salda\u00f1a (best supporting actress, for Emilia P\u00e9rez).\n\nAnora, about a New York stripper who has a whirlwind romance with the son of a Russian oligarch, had been picking up best picture momentum ahead of the Oscars next month - but instead came away with best actress and best casting.\nThe best actress win for Madison was something of a surprise, despite her impressive performance in Sean Baker's film. Madison herself, on accepting the prize, said: \"Wow, I really wasn't expecting this. I probably should have listened to my publicist  and written a speech or something!\"\nThe 25-year-old starred in US comedy series Better Things and also had roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and horror film Scream. But her leading role in Anora has catapulted her into the spotlight.\nMadison added: \"I want to take a moment to recognise the sex worker community. I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be an ally and a friend.\"\nDemi Moore, who stars in body horror The Substance, has been picking up best actress prizes in the last couple of months, including at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards.\nMany thought she would win the Bafta, too. She will still be a favourite at the Oscars although Madison's Bafta win does make things more interesting.\nThe Substance only picked up one win on Sunday for make-up and hair. The film sees a TV aerobics presenter in her 50s (Moore) who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. Full of gory effects, the film is the favourite to pick up the same prize at next month's Oscars.\n\n\nConclave, about a a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals who gather in Rome to elect a new Pope, which stars Ralph Fiennes, had led the charge with 12 nominations.\nBerger said he was \"deeply moved\" to win best film, and that winning outstanding British film, was \"a huge, huge honour\".\n\"Best British and I'm not even from here, so I feel so welcome in your midst,\" he added.\nBafta rules state that films in this category \"must have significant creative involvement by individuals who are British\".\nBerger added that we \"live in a time of a crisis of democracy\", and ended his speech by quoting Leonard Cohen, saying: \"There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.\"\nBrody, collecting his best actor win, told the audience The Brutalist \"is really about the pursuit of leaving something meaningful\", while Corbet said he was \"humbled and very grateful\".\nThe ceremony was hosted by David Tennant at London's Royal Festival Hall. The actor wore a kilt and opened the ceremony by belting out The Proclaimers' classic song, I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), joined by other stars including James McAvoy and Colman Domingo.\nIn what has been an unpredictable awards season, the Baftas followed a similar pattern, with no single film sweeping the board, and several movies sharing the spoils.\nThis was the third year in a row that no British stars won any of the four acting prizes at the most prestigious night in the British film calendar.\nFilms that had multiple nominations but lost out on the night included A Complete Unknown, the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Nosferatu, Blitz, Gladiator II and The Apprentice.\n\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, the French-made film, about a dangerous Mexican drug lord who decides to leave the world of crime and live a new life as a woman, has been the subject of controversy in recent weeks. Offensive social media posts by its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, were unearthed.\nSome wondered if the saga would affect its chances. With 11 nominations, it ended up winning best international film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a's win. She is now a favourite to replicate her Bafta win at next month's Oscars. \nOn accepting the international film prize, the film's director, Jacques Audiard, thanked the cast, including Gascon, as did Salda\u00f1a.\nKieran Culkin's win for a A Real Pain was widely expected. The award was collected by his co-star and the film's writer and director, Jesse Eisenberg.\nEisenberg's film, about two cousins who explore their Jewish grandmother's roots in Poland, also picked up the award for best original screenplay.\nActor and TV presenter Warwick Davis was awarded the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy. He thanked his mother - his \"first agent\" and his \"wonderful wife Sammy who died almost a year ago\". \nThe In Memoriam segment, which honours those from the film community who we have lost in the past year, paid tribute to the likes of Dame Maggie Smith, James Earl Jones, David Lynch, Dame Joan Plowright and Donald Sutherland.\nOther winners included Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part 2, which won special effects and sound.\nBlockbuster musical film Wicked won best production design for Brits Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales. It was Crowley's first Bafta and his sixth nomination, although Sandales has won twice previously. It also picked up best costume design.\nAardman's latest Wallace and Gromit film, Vengeance Most Fowl, won best animation - perhaps surprisingly, it's the first time they have won this award. They also picked up the inaugural award for best children and family film. \n\nWest Belfast rap group Kneecap won the Bafta for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.\nThe Irish-language film is based on a semi-fictionalised account of how the band was formed.\nThe film's English director, Rich Peppiatt, said on accepting the prize: \"Kneecap is more than a film, it's a movement,\" adding that everyone should have their language and culture respected.\nSuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve story, a film about the life of the Superman star who was paralysed in a horse riding accident 10  years before his death in 2004, won best documentary. His children took to the stage to honour their late father.\n\nRead more about this year's main Bafta winners:",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Today we praise VAR' - MOTD pundits discuss Liverpool v Wolves\nThe Premier League title race is heading towards the final straight - and this is when the nerves start to show.\nWhen Liverpool edged past Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 on Sunday, Anfield roared with relief as much as joy.\nThe Reds did not manage an attempt on goal in the second half, but did just enough to ensure they remain seven points clear at the top of the table.\n\"Everyone gets nervous,\" accepted Liverpool full-back Andy Robertson after the Wolves win.\n\"The players get nervous, the crowd gets nervous - that's only natural. But another game down. This result is big.\"\nWith 13 games remaining, how likely are Liverpool to be caught? And who has the toughest run-in?\nHow the top six in the Premier League looks after 25 games\nLiverpool's performance against Wolves on Sunday was hardly one to set the pulses racing. \nThey were good value for their two-goal lead at half time - thanks to a Luis Diaz finish and a Mohamed Salah penalty - but after the break it was struggling Wolves who were the better side.\nThis was the first time on record (since 2003-04) that Liverpool failed to attempt a shot in the second half of a Premier League game at Anfield, according to Opta. \nIn fact, it was the first time in this period that the Reds went an entire half of football without attempting a shot in a home league match.\nBut Liverpool boss Arne Slot was happy to see his side show they are able to win in different ways.\n\"We had to show a different mentality, which we did and got it over the line,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"In a season like this we have played so many great games, but in a season if you want to win something you have to win the difficult ones as well when you are not playing your best. \n\"If you want to achieve something it is not only about bringing the ball out from the back or Mo scoring goals, it is also about defending.\"\nOpta's supercomputer predicts Liverpool to win the Premier League pretty comfortably and has them to finish on 87 points, seven clear of Arsenal.\nThe statisticians give them an 87.65% chance of winning the title, with the Gunners on 12.35%. Every other team has been given 0% chance of finishing first.\nLiverpool's recent form: WWWDW\nIt is a hectic few weeks for Liverpool, with the Reds having league games pretty much every three days until the end of the month.\nBut things ease considerably in March, when the Reds play just one league game - a home fixture against bottom club Southampton.\nThat's not to say it is a quiet month, however, with Liverpool having the small matter of the EFL Cup final against Newcastle on 16 March.\nOn either 4 or 5 March, Liverpool will also have the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, when they will travel to one of Paris St-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest.

        "article_text": "It has been more than a decade since James Howells' hard drive - containing Bitcoin now worth hundreds of millions of pounds - ended up on a landfill site. \nBut despite facing numerous setbacks, he is determined to continue on his mission to retrieve it.\n\"This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,\" he said, adding he would \"absolutely not\" give up.\nThe value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about \u00a3620m, Mr Howells said \"it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this\" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies. \nMr Howells, from Newport, claimed his ex-partner mistakenly threw out the hard drive, containing 8,000 bitcoins, in 2013, with it ending up in a tip owned by Newport City Council. \nLast month, a High Court judge threw out his efforts to access the landfill or get \u00a3495m in compensation, saying there were no \"reasonable grounds\" for bringing the claim and \"no realistic prospect\" of succeeding at a full trial.\nHe is now planning a case \u2013 representing himself using artificial intelligence to support his claim \u2013 at the Court of Appeal. He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year. \nNewport council said it was making no further comment on the matter.\nMr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value.\nHe has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive \u2013 about the size of a mobile phone \u2013 containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013. As its value soared, he organised a team of experts to attempt to locate and recover it.\nHe repeatedly asked permission from the council for access to the site, offering it a share of the missing Bitcoin if it was successfully recovered.\nAfter Mr Howells launched legal proceedings, the council applied for a High Court hearing to ask a judge to dismiss the claim before going to trial \u2013 which the judge did last month.\nThe council argued its environmental permits would forbid any attempt to excavate the site for the search and previously said such work \"would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area\".\nUnwilling to give up, Mr Howells now believes he has two options open to him to retrieve the digital wallet \u2013 launch a case at the Court of Appeal, or work with investors to try to buy the landfill site from the council, after it announced the site is \"coming to the end of its life\" and it plans to close it within the next two years.\nMr Howells told BBC News he was pleased with the work his legal team had done in the High Court trial, but that he would now be representing himself in a case filed with the Court of Appeal \u2013 using an \"artificial intelligence agent\" to assist his claim.\nHe described AI as \"an absolutely amazing technology\" that had helped him better understand court processes and the law, and that he believed he had about seven \"solid grounds in law\" for his case, which he hopes to be able to present in-person to the Court of Appeal.\nOne of the arguments in his case will centre on the council's plans to close the site, something he argued should have been revealed during the High Court trial.\n\"That is material information that should have been made [at the trial] \u2013 the judge should have been aware of that, as well as myself,\" he said.\nMr Howells also said buying and fully excavating the site would save the council what he argued were significant maintenance costs once the site closes.\n\"Every single piece would be extracted or recycled, and at the end of the process we would have a hard drive in our hands - and we would also have an empty landfill,\" he said.\nIn the High Court trial, the council also argued that the hard drive became its property as soon as it entered the landfill site, but Mr Howells said this failed to take into account the fact it was his ex-partner who threw it out.\n\"It was taken without my permission or consent,\" he said.\nMr Howells said he was also exploring the option of buying the site from the council, adding he had \"preliminary agreements\" with investors \u2013 including those in the Middle East and the United States \u2013 who could make funding available if he had permission to buy the site.\n\"They're not just going to put millions of quid in my back pocket... but if the council show a willingness to sell the site, then the funding will be available,\" he said.\nThe council has made no indication it is interested in selling the site and, as part of its closure, has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.\nHaving spent many years pursuing it, including opening legal cases, Mr Howells said he was certain the hard drive remained on the landfill, which holds more than 1.4 million tonnes of waste.\nHe said he had done his \"due diligence and research\", having spoken to a site manager at the landfill.\n\"Anything that was put into that site is still there. So, where else could it be?\"\nAsked if he would ever give up his mission to retrieve it, he said: \"Absolutely not. This is like the final battle in Braveheart.\"\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.\nBitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit. \nSatoshis are named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 believed to be a pseudonym \u2013 who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.\nThose investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a \"very small\" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.\nBitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being \"very quickly enamoured with it\", Mr Bambrough said.\nPrices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when \"stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely\".\n\"A lot of people got very rich, but a lot of people also lost money,\" Mr Bambrough said.\nThe cryptocurrency also saw rapid increases in late 2024, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the US general election, with his administration being seen as far friendlier towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.\n\"A lot of people in the crypto and Bitcoin worlds say the price has gone up so much in such a short amount of time, they claim it could go higher and higher,\" Mr Bambrough said.\n\"So I can understand why James [Howells] is keen to find his Bitcoin.\"",

        "article_text": "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.\nRakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.\n\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.\nWhen Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.\n\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.\nHer teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.\nFor a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.\nA middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.\nThere was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.\nHowever, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.\nHe invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.\nWhen they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"\nCompetition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.\nOver time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.\nThey won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.\nRakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.\nThey missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.\nSimran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.\nBut in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.\nBut the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.\nSimran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.\n\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.\nSimran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.\nTheir first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.\n\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.\nBut by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.\nRiding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.\nBut Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.\nAlthough guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.\n\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.\nBoth Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.\nDespite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.\nRakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"\nThe BBC Indian Sportswoman Of The Year (ISWOTY) Award is back with its fifth edition to celebrate and honour the remarkable achievements of women athletes in India. Find out about the nominees - the winner will be announced on 17 February.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank.",

        "article_text": "Thousands of Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers are logging off during peak hours on Valentine's Day in a campaign for better pay and working conditions, a union says.\nThe strike action is taking place across the UK from 16:00 to 22:00 GMT.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would unite \"drivers up and down the country faced with low pay and insecure conditions\". \nUber, Bolt and Addison and Lee have defended their working conditions after the IWGB said drivers in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Brighton were backing the strike.\nVasilica Dumitrescu has been working for various platforms, including Uber and Bolt, for the last nine years. The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

US officials said that Ukraine had also been invited - though President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has received no such invitation.\nConservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told Victoria Derbyshire it was \"too premature to make assumptions\" about the way the peace talks were heading.\n\"We all have to have very, very cold and calm heads right now, primarily because this conflict is still raging.\"\nShe said Ukrainians should be the ones to determine their future because the war was about their \"independence and sovereignty\". \nAsked if she supported President Trump's proposal that Ukraine give up territory to end the conflict, she said: \"We have to understand in more detail what they are saying, it's too easy to generalise.\n\"It's very early days in those talks, and I think right now, the United Kingdom, along with Nato allies, we must continue to be firm and solid and strong in that support we're giving.\" \nDame Priti added that as a priority, the UK needed to step up its spending on defence.  \nAppearing on the same programme, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said it was \"no surprise\" Trump and his team were taking \"a completely different\" approach by putting \"everything up for grabs\" in terms of Ukraine.\nHe described it as a \"massive wake-up call\" for European leaders to take responsibility for their own defence.  \nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Ukraine had to be \"at the front and centre\" of any peace talks.  \nHe warned that the Trump administration's moves could leave Ukraine and the rest of Europe \"at risk of future Russian aggression\". \nKarin von Hippel, former director at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said she did not think Trump would \"sell Ukraine down the river\" and European nations should \"stay calm\".\nMeanwhile, Conservative former Prime Minister Sir John Major has warned that democracy was under threat as the US steps back from its role as a world leader.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that Trump's policy of \"isolation\" was creating a power vacuum which would embolden countries like Russia and China to fill it.\nSir John said: \"Many of the gains we made over recent years, when the Soviet Union collapsed, are now being reversed and you see a very aggressive Russia again in Ukraine.\n\"And if they were to succeed with their venture in Ukraine, no doubt they'd be elsewhere before too long.\"",

        "article_text": "US black nationalist leader Malcolm X was assassinated on 21 February 1965, at the age of 39. The BBC reported on the reaction in his adopted home of Harlem, New York, as thousands of people queued to pay their last respects.\nAt a time when black civil rights leaders were preaching peaceful integration, Malcolm X's uncompromising vision of black separatism inspired many people, while terrifying others. He was murdered in February 1965, and a reporter for the BBC's Panorama, Michael Charlton, stated at his funeral that he \"spoke a vengeful message, as forthright and chilled as the winter morning they buried him\". Amid tight security, the many thousands of people who had filed past his body were searched by police as a precaution against bombings. \"To these people, he preached that if the white man didn't answer for the black man's frustration, he must answer for his fury,\" added Charlton.\nHe was internationally famous for his incendiary rhetoric, yet he had been developing a new, more moderate worldview. Asked what the death of Malcolm X meant to him by Panorama, one clearly upset man who was in the queue said: \"It's a blow to every black person in the United States of America.\" A young man described him as a hero, saying: \"He stood out among all black people. He showed the white man where it was at.\" This interviewee was one of several people who feared that more violence would follow. \"Whoever did it, Muslims or whoever did it, there's going to be a whole lot of hurt,\" he predicted. One young woman said: \"I don't believe it. Why would they kill another black man?\" Another woman had no doubt who was responsible: \"The white power structure in America is behind it. They quickly capitalised on it by saying that one of his own kind did it, but they put it up to be done. They know they had more to gain by getting Malcolm X out of the way than they had to let him live.\"\nMalcolm X was shot dead on stage at a New York ballroom as he prepared to deliver a speech to his Organization of Afro-American Unity. His wife and children were in the audience. Three men convicted of his murder were all members of the Nation of Islam, the political and religious body that, a year earlier, Malcolm X had left amid acrimony. One of the men was caught while attempting to flee, and confessed to the murder, but the other two convictions resulted in a long-running miscarriage of justice campaign. In 2021, a New York state judge agreed, and their convictions were quashed. Both men were later fully exonerated after New York's attorney general found prosecutors had withheld evidence that, in all likelihood, would have cleared them of blame for the murder.\nStill a controversial figure 60 years after his death, Malcolm\u00a0X remains to some the ultimate symbol of rage and resistance in the face of oppression. Born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska, he was the son of a Baptist preacher. When\u00a0Malcolm\u00a0was six years old, his father was killed in what many believe was a deliberate racist attack by white supremacists, although nobody knows for sure if this was the case. The shock of his father being killed led his mother to have a mental breakdown, and Malcolm and his seven siblings were shipped out to foster homes. He fell into a life of crime, and in 1946 he was jailed for burglary. While in prison, he discovered a love of learning and self-improvement. There, he encountered the ideas of the Nation of Islam, a political and religious body that argued that equality for black Americans could only be achieved through black and white people living in separate states.\u00a0\nUpon his release from prison in 1952, he formally changed his name to Malcolm X. It was a firm rejection of the surname that had been given to his family by the people who, generations earlier, had enslaved them. He toured the US, spreading the Nation of Islam's message, and discovered that he had the power and charisma to inspire people with his words. Public speaking was a skill he had learnt, having entered prison as a middle-school dropout who, he admitted, \"didn't know a verb from a house\". He was not afraid to use shock tactics to get his message across, condemning white people as the \"white devil\" for the historic oppression of black people.\u00a0When US President John F Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, he said it was \"chickens coming home to roost\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nWhile Malcolm X attracted many followers, he also made a lot of enemies. In March 1964 he announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam, having become disillusioned with its leadership. That same month, he witnessed a debate in Washington DC about the Civil Rights Bill, and he finally met Martin Luther King, Jr, a civil rights leader whose belief in nonviolent protest was often seen as being in stark contrast with Malcolm X's more confrontational philosophy.\u00a0\nTo deepen his Muslim faith, he went on the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He wrote about how he witnessed \"pilgrims of all colours from all parts of this Earth displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood like I've never seen before\". He also toured several countries in Africa, where he made the decision to form a new secular group that sought to reconnect African Americans with their heritage. Upon his return to the US, he renounced the teachings of the Nation of Islam. Around that time, Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz began receiving death threats over the phone, and their home was firebombed.\u00a0\nDespite apparent threats coming from many directions, he continued making his electrifying public appearances. In June 1964, he officially launched his Organization of Afro-American Unity, telling the gathered audience: \"We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary.\" The venue was the Audubon Ballroom in New York's Washington Heights neighbourhood; eight months later he was murdered on that same stage.\nAs mourners continued to file past Malcolm X's body in a Harlem funeral home, Charlton asked several prominent people about what sort of leader he might have become. Malcolm X had become a regular visitor to the United Nations headquarters in New York, according to Daniel Watts, the editor of black nationalist magazine The Liberator. Watts said that he had been highlighting discrimination against black people in the US to members of the Afro-Asian bloc. \"I think for the first time in the history of the struggle here in this country, we had a molecule of hope \u2013 hope in the sense in knowing that we had a heritage, we had roots, we had a motherland to which we could look for,\" he said.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr, a misunderstood icon of US history\n\u2022\u00a0The day Nelson Mandela walked out of prison a free man\n\u2022\u00a0Nina Simone on how racial injustice fuelled her songs\nJames Farmer, director of the Congress of Racial Equality, told Panorama that while Malcolm X had not been a part of the civil rights movement, his \"more extreme stance\" had boosted its position. He said: \"The public saw very clearly that unless they did what the civil rights movement demanded, they might get Malcolm X. In fact, Malcolm said just that to me once after a debate we had. He said, 'You know you ought to stop pushing us around like this.' I asked why. He said, 'Because we help you. We make a lot of noise, people look at us and scream bloody murder, and then turn to you.'\" Farmer said that Malcolm X had been successful in giving younger black people a sense of identity. \"It has been very important because a person cannot have a sense of destiny for the future unless he believes he is somebody first.\"\nFarmer also said that Malcolm X had been trying to broaden his appeal since his split with the Nation of Islam. \"I feel that his position was in a state of flux, and that he was moving closer toward an integrationist and desegregationist position. He was over at my house just six weeks before he died, and there I asked him if his views had changed on racial issues and he indicated it was true, he was giving up black racism. Now he was prepared, he told me, to accept a man on the basis of his deeds rather than his genes. This was a switch.\"\nPoet Maya Angelou was a friend of Malcolm X who had reconnected with him during his Africa trip when he visited Ghana, where she was living at the time. Speaking in 1992, she told the BBC: \"He came to Ghana and said, 'I have found blue-eyed men who I'm able to call brother, so my prior statement that all whites were devils is erroneous.' It takes an incredible amount of courage to be able to say, 'Say everybody, you remember what I said yesterday? I've found out that's wrong.' And that's what he was able to do. That was amazing.\"\nCharlton concluded his Panorama report on Malcolm X's funeral by observing that he \"died too soon after his adoption of more moderate views for us to know what wider appeal he may have attracted\". He said the \"most arresting epitaph\" he heard that week came from a black person who said, \"I don't know how many followers he had, but he had a hell of a lot of well-wishers.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

No casualties were reported, the agency added.\nThe agency remains on \"high alert\" after the incident, with its director general Rafael Grossi saying there is \"no room for complacency\". \nMr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\". \nA catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.\nWhile the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.\nThe radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.\nZelensky posted footage on X appearing to show damage to the giant shield, made of concrete and steel, which covers the remains of the reactor that lost its roof in the explosion.\n\"Another 15 metres [50ft] to the side and there would have been a radiation accident,\" Hryhoriy Ishchenko, chief of the agency that manages the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, told reporters, according to local media.\nSince 1990, Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, while he admits the strike was a \"horrendous attack on a very important structure\", he is \"not concerned\" about the radiation risk.\nProf Smith told the BBC a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" below the damaged outer shield covers radioactive particles and dust from the explosion. \nSimon Evans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was head of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, which oversaw the construction of the protective dome in the 2010s.\nHe described the apparent strike as \"an incredibly reckless attack on a vulnerable nuclear facility\". \nThe shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.\nThe strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.\nThere appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.\nMr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.\n\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.\nZelensky claimed the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"definitely not preparing for negotiations\", after US President Donald Trump said Putin had agreed to begin talks to end the war earlier this week.\nThe incident at Chernobyl comes after increased military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, the IAEA said. \nIn December, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching a drone attack on a convoy of vehicles transporting IAEA experts heading to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear station.\nThe agency last year urged restraint when an attack on Zaporizhzhia raised the risk of a \"major nuclear incident\". Russia and Ukraine traded blame over the attack in August.\n\"I'm more concerned about Zaporizhzhia than Chernobyl,\" Prof Smith said. \n\"The reactors [at Zaporizhzhia] are currently shut down but there is more live fuel there. Chernobyl is still very radioactive, but it's not in a 'hot state' because of its age.\"\nThe number of people who died in the Chernobyl disaster remains disputed. \nAccording to the official, internationally recognised death toll, just 31 people died as an immediate result of Chernobyl while the UN estimates that 50 deaths can be directly attributed to the disaster. \nIn 2005, it predicted a further 4,000 might eventually die as a result of the radiation exposure.",

        "article_text": "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena. \nKay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".\nOne heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".\nAnother had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.\nThe woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".\nBBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".\nThe incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.\nWith this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.\nLarry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".\n\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.\n\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"\nLast year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".\nWhen discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.\n\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply. \n\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"\nDean recalls his shocked response. \n\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" Dean tells the BBC.\nThe Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.\n\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!\n\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"\nHis second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.\nArenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.\n\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.\nHe says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.\n\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"\nAnother British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".\nDean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.\nBut, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.\nAbi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.\nCrucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.\n\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.\n\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\" \nNew comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as an MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.\nFor Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.\n\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.\n\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!\n\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"\nClarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.\n\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"\nThe other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.\n\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"\nShe's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.\n\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"\nHer new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.\nDuring these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".\nWelsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.\nIt's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant. \nHe sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.\n\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.\n\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"\nStag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.\nHilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.\n\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"\n\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.\n\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"\nHe will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certian \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.\nBut it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".\n\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"\nNine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".\nAnd the one that does, \"might have had a bad day, drank too much or they might just be an [idiot]!\n\"I think it's something within people, we like a bit of drama.\"",

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".\nVance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".\nThe Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.\nBut Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.\nHe alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.\n\n\nMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".\nVance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.\nHe raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.\nThe safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.\nBut Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.\nVance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.\nIn response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".\nNine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIn the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties.\n\"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. \"There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, later shared parts of his speech on X, praising it as \"excellent\". The two reportedly met afterwards, according to German public broadcaster ZDF.\nIn his own speech, Pistorius directly addressed Vance, saying: \"Democracy was called into question by the US vice-president for the whole of Europe.\n\"He speaks of the annihilation of democracy,\" Pistorius continued. \"And if I have understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes... that is not acceptable.\"\nVance also made reference to the presidential election in Romania, which was annulled in December after declassified documents suggested it had been targeted by Russian state interference.\nVance told the conference: \"If your democracy can be destroyed with a few $100,000 of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with.\"\nRomanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said his country remains \"a defender of the democratic values that Europe shares with the USA\". \n\"All RO [Romanian] authorities are committed to organising free and fair elections by empowering citizens and guaranteeing the freedom to vote,\" he wrote on X.\nVance later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the conference, which has otherwise mainly focussed on Russia's full-scale invasion.\nZelensky said during the meeting that more work was needed on planning to end the fighting, while Vance said the pair shared a \"fruitful\" conversation.\nTrump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich, but Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the summit.",

        "article_text": "Zakaria is 11 years old and lives in Gaza. He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.\nBut at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.\nAs a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.\nMoments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.\nSeveral of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)",

        "summary": "He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.But at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.As a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.Moments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.Several of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.Some of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.That's where we found Zakaria.Rana gave birth to her baby prematurely and is living in a tent having been displaced three timesEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy.

The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.Renad says all she thinks about is war and \"how we'll survive each day\".We wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.Abdullah, 13, narrates the film.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nThe timing is right - Thomas set to retire at the end of the season\nLife as a cyclist is relentless, so after nearly 20 years of looking forward, eyes fixed on the road ahead, Geraint Thomas has not had much time to reflect on the past.\nThings are different now, though. This season will be Thomas' last of a sparkling career that has seen him win two Olympic gold medals, three World Championship titles, numerous road races and the sport's greatest prize of all, the Tour de France.\nA sport this gruelling does not allow its competitors the indulgence of turning an entire season into a glorified lap of honour but, as the end comes into view, Thomas is more contemplative than usual.\n\"Since I was a kid I dreamt of riding the Tour and being part of the Olympics and winning was obviously a dream as well, but to achieve that was just nuts,\" he tells BBC Breakfast.\n\"I think now the decision is official, you do start to reflect because when you're in it, it's just one thing after the next, year after year, so you don't really appreciate it. I guess at the time you enjoy it but I don't think you sit back and reflect and think, so there will be a bit of that this year.\"\nThis has been something of a long goodbye for Thomas, who indicated he would retire at the end of this year when he signed his most recent Ineos Grenadiers contract in 2023.\nFar from winding down, however, the Welshman has been reinvigorated in the twilight of his career, with last year's third place at the Giro d'Italia securing a Grand Tour podium finish for a third successive season.\nGeraint Thomas: A career in pictures\nThomas savours his moment with history in Rome\nThomas signs new contract with Ineos Grenadiers\nThis summer, the 38-year-old will concentrate on the Tour de France, where he will play a supporting role for the team and \"maybe try to win a stage but just enjoy the race\" that he won in 2018.\n\"Beijing was massive, my first Olympics and winning gold there,\" says Thomas. \"But the Tour's what changed my life, being recognised all over the place.\n\"I was in Alcatraz and some dude recognised me. I think that's when you know it went up a level.\n\"The yellow jersey is iconic. You go anywhere in the world and people will know the yellow jersey, how it signifies cycling and its history. So to be a part of that history and to win it, I just pinch myself.\"\nConsidering how competitive Thomas remains at the highest level, you would be forgiven for wondering why he is retiring.\n\"This is my 19th year as a professional and I didn't want to do one year too many and be the grumpy guy in the team,\" he explains.\n\"I'm still really enjoying it, I still feel competitive and the last year has been good, but I think the timing's right. With my family, I'm looking forward to moving back to Cardiff.\n\"There's stuff I think I'll miss, the racing, being here in Monaco, but it will be nice just to be around more and to take on a new challenge.\"\nGeraint Thomas: Over the Finish Line\nCycling superstar Geraint Thomas talks about deciding to retire, his extraordinary achievements, and life in elite sport. \nThomas has not yet decided what that new challenge will be, but he will have plenty of choice.\nThere is a chance he could stay with Ineos Grenadiers in a new capacity, while there will be no shortage of offers to work in the media.\n\"Having options is always good,\" Thomas says. \"I need a purpose. Since I was about 17 or 18, I've always been working towards a goal.\n\"To not be working towards anything would be nice for maybe a month, then I'll just go crazy, so I'll definitely have to have some goals.\n\"I want to do an Ironman. I only run two or three times a year, so that's something that needs a bit of work! It's about challenging myself in different ways.\"\nA future as a triathlete can wait. Once he retires, what Thomas is most looking forward to is spending more time with family and friends, particularly his wife Sara and five-year-old son Macs.\n\"That's the main thing, just being around more and not missing events - birthdays, weddings, parties or whatever,\" he adds. \"I'm looking forward to that side of things.\"\nRetirement is also bound to bring with it myriad offers to appear on reality TV programmes, although Thomas has been warned off Strictly Come Dancing.\n\"I reckon the fitness would be the only thing I've got. I wouldn't back myself. Although my parents-in-law tell me 'please don't do it, you'll make a fool of yourself' and that makes me want to do it,\" he laughs.\n\"That would be the biggest challenge of my life for sure. Maybe I've got the hips for it.\"\nHaving completed the 2013 Tour de France despite breaking his pelvis during the opening stage of the three-week race, Thomas has proved that he is ready to test that particular area of his anatomy.\nIn fact, there are few parts of Thomas' body that have not been bloodied or bruised at some point over the course of his career, and his physical fortitude has earned him the respect of his peers as well as cycling followers around the world.\nOnce he has navigated his final Tour de France and one last summer on the road, Thomas plans to bring the curtain down on his career at the Tour of Britain in September.\nThe route has not yet been finalised but the closing stage could be held in Cardiff, the city where Thomas was born and bred and where he will return to live after retiring.\n\"It would be epic if that happens. I haven't really thought about it much, but when I do start thinking about it, it's going to be emotional. Maybe I'll shed a tear or two,\" Thomas says.\n\"It would be some way to finish, whether it's Cardiff or wherever, the Tour of Britain as the final race. It's full circle, isn't it? Finishing my career back home.\"",

        "article_text": "With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.\nAll the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.\nThe bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.\nGoing back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.\nIt was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.\n\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.\nBut for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.\n\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.\nAnother farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.\n\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.\nAlso known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThey are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.\nStanding at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.\nBut with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.\n\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.\nIn the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.\nThis decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.\n\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.\nAround Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. \nConservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.\nDozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.\n\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.\nMr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.\nFarmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.\n\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed.

Why Uganda's iconic crested crane faces extinction1 day agoWycliffe MuiaBBC News, MbararaGetty ImagesWith its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died. \"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.Conservationists recommend farmers use scarecrows instead of poison\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.During the BBC's visit to Mbarara it proved difficult to find crested cranes - except early in the morningAnd in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law. \"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.",

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Israel's prime minister has said he is working to make US President Donald Trump's plan to remove and resettle Gaza's population \"a reality\".\nBenjamin Netanyahu said he was co-operating with the US on a \"common strategy\" for the Palestinian territory after a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday.\nThe talks come after US President Donald Trump proposed a US takeover Gaza and removal of the two million Palestinians there to neighbouring countries. \nThe UN has warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly prohibited under international law and \"tantamount to ethnic cleansing\".\nAmerica's top diplomat said President Trump's plan may have \"shocked and surprised\" people, but it took \"courage\" to propose an alternative to \"tired ideas\" of the past.\nNetanyahu said he and Rubio had discussed ways to implement Trump's vision, adding that the US and Israel had a common position on Gaza.\nThe Israeli leader warned that the \"gates of hell\" would be opened if all Israeli hostages held by the armed group Hamas were not released.\n\"Hamas can not continue as a military or government force,\" Rubio added. \"And as long as it stands as a force that can govern or administer or a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.\"\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nThe fighting has caused devastation in Gaza, where more than 48,200 people have been killed during the 16-month war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nMost of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.\nPalestinian and Arab leaders have widely rejected Trump's Gaza takeover plan, with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas emphasising that Palestinian land is \"not for sale\".\nUnlike previous US peace efforts in the region, the US top diplomat did not meet any Palestinian leaders to discuss the future of Gaza.\nSpeaking at a joint news conference on Sunday, Rubio and Netanyahu outlined areas of agreement, including a desire to eradicate Hamas's governing capacity in the enclave, prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon, and to monitor developments in post-Assad Syria.\nRubio went on to accuse Tehran of being \"behind every act of violence, behind every destabilising activity, behind everything that threatens peace and stability\" in the region.\nNetanyahu also condemned what he called \"lawfare\" from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which he said \"outrageously libelled\" Israel.\nHe thanked the US administration for issuing sanctions against the ICC, which last year issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former defence minister over alleged war crimes in Gaza - which Israel denies - as well as a top Hamas commander.\nRubio is visiting Israel on his first tour of the Middle East as the US secretary of state. He is also due to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in coming days for talks on the war in Ukraine - a meeting that neither Ukraine nor other European countries have been invited to.\nHis visit comes after a shipment of American-made heavy bombs arrived in Israel overnight.\nIsrael's Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country had received a delivery of MK-84 bombs from the US late on Saturday, after Trump overturned a block on exporting the munitions placed by his predecessor, Joe Biden.\nBiden initially shipped thousands of MK-84s to Israel after Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, but later declined to clear the bombs for export out of concern for their impact on Gaza.

        "summary": "\"The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.The fighting has caused devastation in Gaza, where more than 48,200 people have been killed during the 16-month war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.Palestinian and Arab leaders have widely rejected Trump's Gaza takeover plan, with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas emphasising that Palestinian land is \"not for sale\".Unlike previous US peace efforts in the region, the US top diplomat did not meet any Palestinian leaders to discuss the future of Gaza.Speaking at a joint news conference on Sunday, Rubio and Netanyahu outlined areas of agreement, including a desire to eradicate Hamas's governing capacity in the enclave, prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon, and to monitor developments in post-Assad Syria.Rubio went on to accuse Tehran of being \"behind every act of violence, behind every destabilising activity, behind everything that threatens peace and stability\" in the region.Netanyahu also condemned what he called \"lawfare\" from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which he said \"outrageously libelled\" Israel.He thanked the US administration for issuing sanctions against the ICC, which last year issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former defence minister over alleged war crimes in Gaza - which Israel denies - as well as a top Hamas commander.Rubio is visiting Israel on his first tour of the Middle East as the US secretary of state. Netanyahu praises Trump's 'bold vision' for Gaza at Rubio meeting22 hours agoIan Aikman & Maia DaviesBBC NewsReutersThe US secretary of state met the Israeli prime minister in Jerusalem on Sunday Israel's prime minister has said he is working to make US President Donald Trump's plan to remove and resettle Gaza's population \"a reality\".Benjamin Netanyahu said he was co-operating with the US on a \"common strategy\" for the Palestinian territory after a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday.The talks come after US President Donald Trump proposed a US takeover Gaza and removal of the two million Palestinians there to neighbouring countries. The powerful 2,000-pound bombs have a wide blast radius and can rip through concrete and metal, destroying entire buildings.Katz said the shipment represented a \"significant asset\" for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and served as evidence of the \"strong alliance between Israel and the United States\".Meanwhile, Hamas said an Israeli air strike had killed three police officers near Rafah in southern Gaza on Sunday, which it called a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire.Israel said it had struck \"several armed individuals\" in southern Gaza.The ceasefire came into force on 19 January and requires a complete pause in fighting for the first 42-day phase. He is also due to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in coming days for talks on the war in Ukraine - a meeting that neither Ukraine nor other European countries have been invited to.His visit comes after a shipment of American-made heavy bombs arrived in Israel overnight.Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country had received a delivery of MK-84 bombs from the US late on Saturday, after Trump overturned a block on exporting the munitions placed by his predecessor, Joe Biden.Biden initially shipped thousands of MK-84s to Israel after Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, but later declined to clear the bombs for export out of concern for their impact on Gaza. The UN has warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly prohibited under international law and \"tantamount to ethnic cleansing\".Trump's mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing'We are tired of war': Israelis and Gazans fear ceasefire collapseHow 15 months of war has devastated GazaAmerica's top diplomat said President Trump's plan may have \"shocked and surprised\" people, but it took \"courage\" to propose an alternative to \"tired ideas\" of the past.Netanyahu said he and Rubio had discussed ways to implement Trump's vision, adding that the US and Israel had a common position on Gaza.The Israeli leader warned that the \"gates of hell\" would be opened if all Israeli hostages held by the armed group Hamas were not released.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "For 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?\nIn the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.\nBut one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.\nThis would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).\nThough EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.\nIn March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.\nDespite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.\n\"In those days, if a theme tune was popular, you'd often release it as a single. So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.\n\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.\n\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"\nAnother key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.\nAfter a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role.

On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week.

It was immediately decided to take him off.\nHowever, Haaland watched the remainder of the game from the bench and went back on to the pitch to shake hands with opposition players after the final whistle.\n\"When he went down, everyone was scared,\" added Guardiola.\n\"But he got up and walked away smiling as always.

        "article_text": "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.\nUK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.\nThe MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.\nAsked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.\nThe Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.\nThe rejection of their applications was controversial because they came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.\nThe inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.\nBBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.\nThe MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.\nThe confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.\nThe Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: \"There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.\"",

They will all be paying the price for this futile, expensive, and extremely short-term bail out.\n\"This restructuring is simply throwing good money after bad.\"\nHenry Swithinbank, policy and advocacy manager at environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, said the cash lifeline was a \"sticking plaster that will allow Thames Water to limp along until it requires another bailout\".\n\"Today the High Court sided with the fat cats and bosses,\" he added.\nThe first \u00a31.5bn of the rescue loans to Thames Water will see the company through to the autumn. \nA second instalment will be used to fund the company as it appeals a decision by Ofwat over how much Thames can raise household bills by \u2013 a process which could take up to a year.\nThe company was set to repay \u00a3200m worth of debt due in March, but following the court ruling, all its debt repayments have been extended by two years.\nLast week, Thames launched an appeal to allow it to increase bills by more than the regulator had granted.\nOfwat has capped bill rises at 35% over the next five years, but Thames has argued they need to increase by 53%.\nIt claimed that the 35% uplift \"does not appropriately support the investment and improvement that is required\" by the business.\nOther water companies are also permitted to lodge appeals against bill settlements with the Competition and Markets Authority.\nSouthern Water is contesting a 53% increase in household bills over five years, that was approved by Ofwat. Southern had originally asked for permission to hike bills by 84%.\nAnglian Water and South East Water have also appealed. \nSix others have said they will not appeal: Severn Trent, United Utilities, Pennon plus Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, SES and Hafren.\nThames Water's problems have been blamed on a combination of poor historical regulation, actions by shareholders, climate change and management failure.\nSome have argued Thames should have been allowed to collapse and be nationalised due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.\nBut others, including water companies, have argued that a growing population and the challenges of a changing climate mean bills need to be higher and were kept at lower levels for too long.",

A second instalment will be used to fund the company as it appeals a decision by Ofwat over how much Thames can raise household bills by \u2013 a process which could take up to a year.The company was set to repay \u00a3200m worth of debt due in March, but following the court ruling, all its debt repayments have been extended by two years.Last week, Thames launched an appeal to allow it to increase bills by more than the regulator had granted.Ofwat has capped bill rises at 35% over the next five years, but Thames has argued they need to increase by 53%.It claimed that the 35% uplift \"does not appropriately support the investment and improvement that is required\" by the business.Other water companies are also permitted to lodge appeals against bill settlements with the Competition and Markets Authority.Southern Water is contesting a 53% increase in household bills over five years, that was approved by Ofwat. \"Today the High Court sided with the fat cats and bosses,\" he added.Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?How much will I have to pay for my water?How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?The first \u00a31.5bn of the rescue loans to Thames Water will see the company through to the autumn. The politician, who gave a witness statement to the High Court opposing the loan, said: \"Allowing Thames Water to take on \u00a33bn more debt is not in the interests of their millions of customers. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.But others, including water companies, have argued that a growing population and the challenges of a changing climate mean bills need to be higher and were kept at lower levels for too long.CompaniesThames Water",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy, with the US said to have identified about 18,000 Indian nationals it believes entered illegally.\nLast week Narendra Modi said India would take back its nationals who were in the US illegally, and also crack down on the \"human trafficking ecosystem\".\n\"These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and promises,\" he said during his visit to Washington.\nNow a new paper by Abby Budiman and Devesh Kapur from Johns Hopkins University has shed light on the numbers, demographics, entry methods, locations and trends relating to undocumented Indians over time.\nHere are some of the more striking findings.  \nUnauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.\nThe number of undocumented Indians among them is contested however, with estimates varying widely due to differing calculation methods.\nPew Research Center and Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) estimate some 700,000 people as of 2022, making them the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador.\nIn contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) puts the figure at 375,000, ranking India fifth among origin countries. \nThe official government data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  offers yet another picture, reporting 220,000 unauthorised Indians in 2022.\nThe vast differences in estimates highlight the uncertainty surrounding the true size of the undocumented Indian population, according to the study. \nIndian migrants make up only a small share of the overall unauthorised migrant population in the US.\nIf Pew and CMS estimates are accurate, nearly one in four Indian immigrants in the US is undocumented - an unlikely scenario given migration patterns, the study says. (Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing groups in the US, surging from 600,000 in 1990 to 3.2 million in 2022.)\nThe DHS estimated in 2022 that the undocumented Indian population in the US dropped 60% from its 2016 peak, falling from 560,000 to 220,000. \nHow did the number of undocumented Indians drop so steeply from 2016 to 2022? Mr Kapur says the data doesn't provide a clear answer, but plausible explanations could be that some obtained legal status while others returned, particularly due to COVID-related hardships.\nHowever, this estimate doesn't reflect a 2023 surge in Indians at US borders, meaning the actual number could now be higher.\nDespite rising border encounters, US government estimates show no clear increase in the overall undocumented Indian population from the US financial year (FY) 2020 to 2022, according to the study.\nEncounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada.\nVisa overstays by Indians have remained steady at 1.5% since 2016.  \nThe number of Indian recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) has also declined from 2,600 in 2017 to 1,600 in 2024. The Daca programme protects migrants who came to the US as children. \nTo sum up: the undocumented Indian population grew both in numbers and as a share of all unauthorised migrants, rising from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.9% in 2015 before dropping to 2% in 2022.\nThe US has two main land borders. \nThe southern border along the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas bordering Mexico sees the most migrant crossings. Then there's the US-Canada border spanning 11 states.\nBefore 2010, encounters involving Indians at the two borders were minimal, never exceeding 1,000. \nSince 2010, nearly all encounters involving Indians occurred along the US-Mexico southern border. \nIn FY 2024, encounters of Indian nationals on the northern border surged to 36% of all Indian crossings, up from just 4% the previous year.\nCanada had become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with shorter visitor visa processing times than the US.  \nAlso, there was a surge in attempted border crossings from 2021 onwards, and the encounters at the Mexico border peaked in 2023.\n\"This is not specific to Indians. It is part of a larger surge of migrants trying to come into the US after Biden was elected. It is as if there was a high tide of migrants and Indians were a part of it,\" Mr Kapur told the BBC.\nThe study finds that the states with the largest Indian immigrant populations -California (112,000), Texas (61,000), New Jersey (55,000), New York (43,000) and Illinois (31,000) - also have the highest numbers of unauthorised Indian immigrants.\nIndians make up a significant share of the total unauthorised population in Ohio (16%), Michigan (14%), New Jersey (12%) and Pennsylvania (11%). \nMeanwhile, states where more than 20% of Indian immigrants are unauthorised include Tennessee, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and California.\n\"We expect this because it's easier to blend in and find work in an ethnic business - like a Gujarati working for a Gujarati-American or a Punjabi/Sikh in a similar setup,\" Mr Kapur said. \nThe US immigration system allows people who are detained at the border who fear persecution in their home countries to undergo credible \"fear screenings\". Those who pass can seek asylum in court, leading to a rise in asylum applications alongside rising border apprehensions.\nAdministrative data doesn't reveal the exact demographics of Indian asylum seekers, but court records on spoken languages provide some insight.\nPunjabi-speakers from India have dominated Indian asylum claims since 2001. After Punjabi, Indian asylum seekers spoke Hindi (14%), English (8%) and Gujarati (7%).\nThey have filed 66% of asylum cases from FY 2001\u20132022, suggesting Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana as key migrant sources.\nPunjabi speakers from India also had the highest asylum approval rate (63%), followed by Hindi speakers (58%). In contrast, only a quarter of Gujarati speakers' cases were approved.\nUS data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed.\nThe requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023.\nWhile this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says.\nMr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\". \nGiven the large number of Punjabi-speakers who seek asylum, it's unclear what has changed in the northern Indian state ruled by the Congress party (2017-22) and latterly the Aam Aadmi Party (2022\u2013present) to drive this surge.  \nUnder Trump's second presidency, asylum requests are set to plummet. \nWithin his first week, a key app for migrants was shut down and removed from app stores, cancelling nearly 300,000 pending appointments, including asylum cases already in progress.\nUS data shows most Indian asylum seekers are Punjabi and Gujarati - groups from India's wealthier states, better able to afford high migration costs. \nIn contrast, Indian Muslims and marginalised communities and people from conflict zones like the regions affected by Maoist violence and Kashmir, rarely seek asylum, the study says.\nSo most Indian asylum seekers are economic migrants, not from the country's poorest or conflict-hit regions.\nThe arduous journey to the US - whether via Latin America or as \"fake\" students in Canada - costs 30-100 times India's per capita income, making it accessible only to those with assets to sell or pledge, the study says.\nNot surprisingly, Punjab and Gujarat - top origin states for unauthorised Indians -  are among India's wealthier regions, where land values far exceed returns from farming.  \n\"Even illegality takes a lot of money to pursue,\" the study says. \nWhile rising asylum claims may seem linked to \"democratic backsliding\" in India, correlation isn't causation, the authors say .\nPunjab and Gujarat have long histories of emigration, with migrants heading not just to the US but also the UK, Canada and Australia. \nRemittances - India received an estimated $120bn in 2023 - fuel aspirations for a better life, driven not by poverty but \"relative deprivation\", as families seek to match the success of others abroad, the study says. \nA parallel industry of agents and brokers in India has cashed in on this demand. \nThe Indian government, says the study, \"has looked the other way, likely because the issue of illegal migration is much more a burden for receiving than sending countries\". \nBetween 2009 and 2024, around 16,000 Indians were deported, according to India's ministry of external affairs.  \nThese deportations averaged 750 per year under Obama, 1,550 under Trump's first term, and 900 under Biden.\nIndian migrant removals spiked between FY 2023 and 2024, but the peak was in 2020 with nearly 2,300 deportations.",

This did not work and it was Merino's arrival and accomplished finishing with both goals in the 2-0 win, that has given Arteta very palatable food for thought and kept the Gunners firmly in the title hunt.\nWilliam Saliba offered himself up as a potential striker solution after Kai Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring injury on Arsenal's sunshine break to Dubai, but this was not an option given his high-class quality in defence.\nArteta suggested another defender, Riccardo Calafiori, might be in the frame and the Italian has shown an eye for a goal - but Merino has made his case in Arsenal's state of emergency, scoring twice in a game for the first time since 2016.\nIt was a tactical switch that had a touch of desperation as well as improvisation, but Arteta and Merino must take the credit as Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 15 games in the Premier League - 10 wins and five draws.

He's got really good timing to arrive in certain areas and execute.\n\"We are going to have various contexts and we are prepared. We have to have the pictures in our heads for these scenarios.

He stole in to head home powerfully from Ethan Nwaneri's right-wing cross with nine minutes left, before finishing with confidence after 87 minutes to wrap up the win that leaves Arsenal four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool having played a game more.\nThe player himself played down the notion he might figure more as a striker, but on this evidence Arteta may give him no say in the matter as he makes his plans without Havertz and Gabriel Jesus until next season.\nMerino said when asked about starting as a striker: \"I don't think so to be honest. It is certainly the first time I have scored two coming off the bench as a striker.\"\nHe told BBC Match Of The Day: \"It was big news for me this morning when one of the assistants told me this was an option. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do.\n\"Mikel told me to use my strengths in the box and I was in the right place at the right time. I've not trained there once but I know what everyone has to do on the pitch. Tactically, we are a rich team and I just tried to emulate all the guys who are out injured.\"\nIf Merino, justifiably, grabbed the headlines, it was 17-year-old Nwaneri who was Arsenal's overall inspiration with a superb performance of skill, confidence, pace and maturity.\nNwaneri delivered the inviting cross for Merino's opener, having previously hit the woodwork twice in Arsenal's only serious moments of threat before those late goals.\nArteta was lavish in his praise of Nwaneri, as well as his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, who ensured Arsenal stayed on level terms by applying a vital touch to Jordan Ayew's cross with Bobby de Cordova-Reid waiting to tap in a simple finish at the far post with the scoreline goalless.\nHe said: \"Physically they are built in a really special way already. Emotionally and mentally, how composed they are, and how they make decisions on the pitch are really impressive, so let them go.\"\nArsenal's nerves and anxiety were mounting until Merino stepped into the breach, the lack of a serious central threat obvious as every attempt floundered near goal with Leicester City holding firm.\nIn among that pre-Merino mediocrity, it was a dismal day for Sterling, who struggled to do a thing right and looked short of confidence and the old pace before Arteta decided he had seen enough.\nSterling looked crestfallen as he walked off, another opportunity missed for the 30-year-old former England forward to show he can still be a going concern at this level as he continues to struggle at Arsenal after being marginalised by Chelsea.\nNo such problems for Merino, who has not had a full effect in midfield since his Arsenal arrival but may now have the chance to do so further forward as Arteta looks to solve his most pressing problem.\nAnd there was a touch of belated romance about Merino's heroics and Arsenal's win as the Spain midfielder said: \"I forgot to give my wife something for Valentine's Day so this goes to her.

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "summary": "India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died9 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, London\u2022@geetapandeybbcGetty ImagesIndia is among a few dozen countries that do not recognise marital rapeWarning: This report contains some disturbing detailsAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.The lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". \"Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.The British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.India government says criminalising marital rape 'excessively harsh'In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriageThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. \"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. \"The court documents make for grim reading.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.Getty ImagesA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to criminalise marital rapeThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".",
