At one point he was 66,000th in the virtual ticket queue but vowed to stay to the bitter end.\n\"I got stuck on about 53,000 for ages,\" he said, \"then all of a sudden it went down to [just] 40-something and quicker from there.\n\"Eventually there was one person in font of me but by the time I got in, everything was sold out, even the super-expensive VIP-type tickets were gone.\n\"It wasn't meant to be this time.\" He went on to say he was \"gutted\".\nFan Emily Pywell, from London, said she was trying to get tickets for her and her boyfriend, Brandon Hall. \nThe pair had tickets to Osbourne's last solo tour No More Tours II, which was cancelled in 2023. \nShe said: \"It's just disappointing for the actual fans that want to (go), that have tried to see them for years, and have lucked out to touts and potentially not as big fans, people that are just going for the experience.\"\nThe 29-year-old said it would be her partner's \"last chance\" to see the singer. \nSpeaking about her ticket-buying experience, she added: \"We had a bigger number in the queue than we'd had during the pre-sales and the rest of the week, [we] only just really got through just now, like two hours after.\n\"It's who can refresh the fastest and click on it the fastest, it's not really a fair system on Ticketmaster.\"\nShe said on Tuesday, the seating map would not load - and when she contacted Ticketmaster on X, she was told to refresh the page only to be kicked to the back of the queue. \n\"Yesterday, I was clicking on seats that are available, but it wasn't selecting them, even though I was clicking on them, so I wasn't able to do it then.\n\"And then today, it's just doing the same, you're just trying to click on them, and it won't select them, or it'll come up saying someone else has already bought them.\"\nMs Pywell now faces a battle to get hotel bookings refunded, after sorting them in advance.\nTicketmaster has been contacted for a comment. \nOthers, though, had better luck. \nSimon Humphreys, from Stourbridge in Dudley, who has an Ozzy tattoo, managed to get two hospitality tickets for \u00a31,088. \nHe explained: \"I said to my missus, this is your birthday, Valentine's, Christmas all done this year - and she's not even into rock or metal.\"\nElsewhere, fans Lauren and James Ashton, from Curdworth in Warwickshire, have been feeling excited. \nThey managed to get tickets on Thursday during a pre-sale event, thereby avoiding Friday's queue, although Mr Ashton joined it for a time just to gauge demand.\n\"I couldn't believe it really,\" he said. \"We logged in and saw we were 77,000.

        "article_text": "Thousands of Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers are logging off during peak hours on Valentine's Day in a campaign for better pay and working conditions, a union says.\nThe strike action is taking place across the UK from 16:00 to 22:00 GMT.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would unite \"drivers up and down the country faced with low pay and insecure conditions\". \nUber, Bolt and Addison and Lee have defended their working conditions after the IWGB said drivers in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Brighton were backing the strike.\nVasilica Dumitrescu has been working for various platforms, including Uber and Bolt, for the last nine years. The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

        "article_text": "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.\nCheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.\nNow, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.\n\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.\n\"That's what we want.\"\nMr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.\nProductions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.\nThe loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.\nBefore the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.\n\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"\nHollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.\nMany say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA. \nBut studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.\nStudios are, however, very responsive to A-list actors.\nMegastar Vin Diesel helped ensure Universal Pictures would finish filming the latest Fast and Furious movie in Los Angeles.\n\"LA really, really, really needs production to help rebuild,\" Diesel said in an Instagram post.\n\"Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago\u2026 and now Fast will finally return home.\"\nNearly 20,000 people \u2013 including actors Keanu Reeves, Zooey Deschanel and Kevin Bacon \u2013 have signed a \"Stay in LA\" petition urging the state's leaders to temporarily remove caps on production tax incentives for LA County.\nIt's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.\n\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.\nBefore the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.\nHe says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.\nIf passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.\nPresident Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".\nIt's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.\nOn a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.\n\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.\nAlthough he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.\nMs Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.\n\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"\nOthers think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.\nPointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.\nHis once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.\n\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.\nAbout a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.\nShe laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.\n\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.\nMs Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.\n\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"\nDoes she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?\n\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\"",

        "article_text": "Some species of birds like geese save energy by flying in close formation. Airliners could use a similar trick to burn less fuel.\nIn the early 1500s, Italian Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci developed a fascination with avian flight. He spent his days meticulously studying the movement of birds, sketching observations of how they maintain their balance and perform soaring manoeuvres.\nHis ambition was to make a flying machine from his scientific investigations. But what he wound up creating instead was the seminal work\u00a0Codex on the Flight of Birds. It pioneered what would later become the field of \"biomimicry\", the study of the natural world in search of efficient design.\u00a0\nCenturies later, experimentation flourished. Pioneering aviators like Otto Lilienthal, Igo Etrich and the Wright brothers mimicked birds to design their aircraft and the aviation industry was born.\nIn 2019, Airbus returned to the study of birds with the \"fello'fly\" project to understand how migrating geese conserve energy while flying in V formation. From it, a\u00a0\"wake energy retrieval\" technique was developed to help\u00a0trailing jets\u00a0pinpoint the optimal location to fly in the wake vortex of a lead jet. This was found to generate fuel savings of 5% to 10% per\u00a0trip, similar to\u00a0findings published by the US space agency Nasa.\u00a0\nIn July 2023, the effort evolved into the\u00a0Geese project\u00a0with\u00a0\u20ac10m (\u00a38.4m/$10.5m)\u00a0in funding, and support from the European Union's air traffic management research arm, Sesar.\nEarlier this month, Delta Air Lines and Airbus announced that they were taking the \"fello'fly\" concept out of the lab and into the skies, targeting the second half of this year to deploy the technique into live operations. The goal will be to test a manoeuvre called \"rendez-vous\" in which two passenger jets are paired over the Atlantic Ocean. For example, this could be an Air France flight from New York City and a Delta Air Lines flight from Miami, both heading to London. In pairing, the two planes would be separated by the regulatory 1,000ft (303m) in altitude while attempting to\u00a0reduce the distance between them to\u00a01.2 nautical miles (2.2km), the same distance that fuel savings were most recently achieved in the lab.\nDelta chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca tells the BBC that this distance is substantially closer than planes fly today, which is typically at a separation of three to five nautical miles (5.5 to 9.2km), so the first step will be to see whether the gap can be narrowed without compromising safety.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0video\u00a0shows an animation of how \"fello'fly\" is expected to work.\nAs for why transatlantic flights were chosen for the test, DeLuca explains, \"there are very few sustainable solutions for wide bodies flying today, besides sustainable aviation fuel. So a 5% benefit off of a flight that's going across the Atlantic with a big airplane that's burning a lot of fuel has the biggest bang for the buck\".\nStephen Trent, an analyst at Citi, says on some routes the formation flying technique could be useuful. \"My guess is that it is also somewhat route dependent, and somewhat dependent on what kind of equipment you're operating. So the opportunity to do that, for example, flying from New York to London, is not going to be the same as an aircraft that's flying from Miami to Mexico City. It's possible that, in some cases, that's something that could help \u2013 like a tailwind that pushes a sailing ship.\"\nAiming to decarbonise operations by 2050, the Delta Carbon Council reported that it had saved\u00a041 million\u00a0gallons (65,800 tonnes) of jet fuel in 2024. DeLuca says that to achieve this, Delta is constantly on the lookout for new ways to conserve energy, like plugging into ground power instead of operating engines on the ground, doing a shorter vector on approach instead of a long roundabout when landing, and installing winglets that point up on the tips of wings to reduce drag.\nOther industry practices include\u00a0continuous climb and decline operations\u00a0that enable\u00a0an altitude to be reached without the need for levelling and\u00a0adjusting the centre of gravity\u00a0on the aircraft to reduce drag.\u00a0Switching to a renewable energy source like\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel is also seen as a solution, however this will require a staggering amount of land to grow enough biomass to make biofuels.\u00a0\u00a0\nDeLuca says Delta quadrupled\u00a0its\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel\u00a0(SAF) usage\u00a0in 2024, but that's still less than 1% of the fuel\u00a0being used\u00a0with it. The main hurdle,\u00a0she says, is the supply of sustainable fuel. However, she's encouraged by Airbus joining Delta which has stated a commitment to purchase several million gallons of SAF annually starting in the second half of 2025.\nKnowing customers are lining up to buy the product gives farmers in rural communities a reason to redirect soy and corn ethanol production into sustainable aviation fuel, says DeLuca.\n\"It's really about economic and social development in rural communities \u2013 job creation, attracting investment into these communities. It's a new industry, so will be a big development opportunity for these sites,\" Airbus chief sustainability officer Julie Kitcher tells the BBC.\nTrent says sustainable aviation fuel won't yet be a silver bullet because it costs far more than conventional fuel. \"Let's say today jet fuel kerosene is like $2.50 (\u00a32) a gallon. If you look at SAF a gallon it can be more than three times that price... Assuming production needs to increase, then bring the price down.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Extreme flying in the name of science\n\u2022\u00a0Can we really fuel planes with fat and sugar?\n\u2022\u00a0How long-haul travel may change\nMeanwhile, across the airline industry, interest in biomimicry has been growing.\nAirbus has a project through its UpNext innovation lab\u00a0\u00a0taking inspiration from eagles, with the goal of creating longer, leaner and lighter high-performance, ultra-flexible wings that can bend and evolve depending on air current and turbulence, with hinges that adapt dynamically and sensors that can determine nuanced movements. It is similar to the morphing wing created by Nasa.\u00a0\nThey are not the only company looking into the technique. Boeing has a partnership with Nasa where it is testing coatings to reduce insect adhesion through the study of lotus leaves.\u00a0\nAnd Lufthansa has been working with chemicals manufacturer BASF on developing a surface film called AeroShark to simulate the texture of shark skin in an effort to save millions of tonnes of fuel per year.\n\"Birds are the experts of flight and so we're using nature to inspire technology,\" Kitcher says. For formation flying, they may be the greatest teachers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "US actress, writer and producer Issa Rae has cancelled her forthcoming appearance at Washington's Kennedy Center over \"an infringement of values\", after Donald Trump named himself the venue's chairman. \nThe US president also fired its board of trustees within weeks of being re-elected, and Rae, the creator and star of HBO's Insecure, said all tickets from her sold-out An Evening With show would be refunded.\nShe added that the \"infringement\" was on a venue which had \"faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums\". \nRae made the announcement about the event, which had been due to take place on 16 March, on her Instagram story.\nThe John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to give the venue its full name, has a mission statement to present classical and contemporary music, opera, drama, dance, and other performing arts from the US and other countries.\nIt also aims to deliver \"powerful arts education opportunities nationwide, and embody the ideals of President Kennedy\".\nWhen the president was asked about his takeover, he said: \"We took over the Kennedy Center.

        "article_text": "From Nubian Markets to the National Center for Afro-American Artists, a local tour guide offers his picks for the best places to see Boston's Black culture\nBoston is a city of neighbourhoods, and if you wander off the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail that passes through 16 significant sites in US history, you'll find extraordinary stories tucked in every nook and corner. Getting visitors to explore the city's varied cultural districts has long been a goal of Collin Knight, who founded Live Like a Local Tours in 2019. As a native of Roxbury, the neighbourhood that's the beating heart of Boston's Black community, he's working to highlight the city's rich African American culture while also acknowledging Boston's history of racial tensions.\u00a0\nThough Boston is perhaps most famous for its strong Irish roots, the city's Black history runs deep. Prior to the US Civil War, Boston was one of the most important stops on the Underground Railroad. The first chartered branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People civil rights organisation was founded here in 1911. Malcolm X moved to Boston 30 years later, followed by Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who considered the city his \"second home\" and fell in love with his would-be wife, Coretta Scott King, here. Today, 25 percent of Boston's population is Black \u2013 twice the percentage of the Black population in the US.\u00a0\n\"When we look at downtown, the city's Eurocentric history is being glorified each and every day. They're not really talking about Native Americans and African Americans and their plight within this country and Boston's connection to slavery,\" Knight says. \"I'm trying to figure out how we can tell the whole history of Massachusetts in the city of Boston instead of just telling one part.\"\u00a0\nHere are Knight's suggestions of the five best places in Boston to experience the city's vibrant modern-day Black culture, as well as the ties to its past.\n1.\u00a0The National Center for Afro-American Artists\u00a0\n\"The National Center for Afro-American Artists (NCAAA) houses art from some of the most prominent African American artists that have lived in the Boston area or are from the Boston area. A lot of people don't know much about it,\" Knight says. \"Dr Barry Gaither has been the curator of that museum since 1968. It was created by Dr Elma Lewis, who was the grande dame of the arts within the Boston area for many years. She was very well known for providing arts and culture to young people of colour within Boston, and Roxbury specifically.\"\u00a0\nKnight's must-see experiences within the museum include seeing the narrative paintings of Roxbury legend Allan Crite, known as the \"Dean of African American artists\" in New England, thanks to his nearly 90-year career. Another highlight, says Knight, is the ASPELTA exhibit displaying artefacts from Nubia. The exhibit features scores of 2,600-year-old objects recovered by archaeologists from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard University, including a fully-accurate recreation of the interior of a Nubian tomb. \"It's pretty incredible,\" Knight says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://ncaaa.org/\nAddress: 300 Walnut Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-442-8614\nFacebook:@themuseum_ncaaa\n\n2. Nubian Markets\u00a0\nThis sprawling new grocery store, halal butcher shop and fast-casual cafe, which opened in Roxbury in spring 2023, celebrates the food of the African diaspora. Its shelves are stocked with hard-to-find produce and vegetable items, and more than 30 Black-owned brands. \"It's absolutely incredible when you think about it: the halal approach, the restaurant/supermarket approach and the fact that it's a Black-owned supermarket in the middle of Roxbury,\" Knight says, noting that, historically, most grocery stores in the neighbourhood had been white-owned or run by white conglomerates.\u00a0\n\"This is a very powerful thing for us as Black people,\" Knight added. \"It's not something that we've ever had in our own community\u2026 They are focused on supporting other local businesses and other vendors of colour across the country.\"\nCuts of lamb, beef, and goat sold at the shop are raised following Islamic standards to feed the city\u2019s growing Muslim population, and many products on its shelves, sauces and spice mixes, are produced by local artisans like Cameroon native Paulette Ngachoko, founder of Hapi African Gourmet. In the cafe, menu items range from ginger beef and injera bowls to pea fritters and lamb couscous. \"I'm just excited about everything they're doing,\" Knight says.\nWebsite: https://www.nubianmarkets.com/\nAddress: 2565 Washington Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-608-4940\nInstagram: @nubianmarkets\n3. Comfort Kitchen\nThis cosy Black-, immigrant- and woman-owned restaurant opened in January 2023 in Dorchester's Uphams Corner neighbourhood. It was nearly a decade in the making and comes with its own dose of history: it's housed inside a 1912-built building that is on the National Register of Historic Places.\u00a0\n\"I love the owners over there. You think about the vibe that's in there, you think about the menu and how it's connected to the African diaspora,\" Knight says. \"[The building] was a comfort station [public restroom] for people travelling from the Dorchester area to the South Shore.\"\u00a0\nInside the former bathroom, the chic 30-seat space has curved pale-pink banquettes that are an Instagram favourite. Cocktails feature Equiano, an Afro-Caribbean rum produced in Mauritius and Barbados, or pay tribute to Black engineering pioneer Lewis Latimer, who worked alongside Alexander Graham Bell to develop the telephone in Boston in the 1880s.

Wally's Cafe and Jazz Club\u00a0\nWally's is an institution in Boston's South End neighbourhood, and when founder Joseph Walcott opened the club in 1947, he was the first African American nightclub owner in New England. Walcott got his start by drawing \u2013 and often driving \u2013 musicians up from New York City and created one of the few spaces in Boston during the time of segregation where anyone of any race could mingle. Today his grandchildren run the space, which hosts music 365 nights a year, often drawing from talented students at Berklee School of Music, the New England Conservatory and other nearby institutions. It's considered the oldest jazz club in the city.\u00a0\n\"What most people don't realise is there were jazz joints and juke joints up and down Massachusetts Avenue. That is the last of a dying breed that we had all over [the area] back in the day.\u00a0All of the greats came to play,\" says Knight \u2013 among them Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday. Check the schedule for their funk, jazz, and salsa offerings, which run from 17:00 to 01:00 nightly.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://wallyscafe.com/\nAddress: 427 Massachusetts Ave., South End\nPhone: 1-617-828-1754\nInstagram: @wallyscafejazzclub\n5. The Embrace\u00a0\nThis new, massive bronze sculpture was unveiled on Boston Common this year, celebrating Boston's civil rights legacy and commemorating the period that Dr Martin Luther King Jr lived in Boston. King attended theology school at Boston University in the 1950s and met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who was attending the New England Conservatory of Music, while living in the city.\nThe sculpture, by artist Hank Willis Thomas, is an abstract depiction based on a photo of the couple embracing after King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. It also recognises a moment in April 1965 when the leader stood on the park before a crowd of 22,000 and called for Boston to live up to its ideals and create a more equitable city.\u00a0\nWhile the sculpture alone \"is a really beautiful piece to tell that history, I think, more importantly, if you look at the grounds of The Embrace, you see all of these names [of people who marched alongside King and helped expand his ideas],\" Knight says. \"It's really about all of the local community advocates that have made a difference within the Roxbury community and the Boston community at large. So, I think it's an incredible tribute to Dr Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King, but it's also a tribute to our city as a whole, to talk about the Black histories of our city, of our neighbourhoods, and have it be in the middle of the Boston Common.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.embraceboston.org/memorial\nAddress: Boston Common, 139 Tremont Street\nInstagram: @embracebos\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published on 17 June 2023 and has been updated, including the removal of one business which has since closed, Soleil restaurant.\n---\u00a0\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u00a0called \"The Essential List\".

        "article_text": "Fingernails help protect the underlying skin from injury, and they also come in handy when you want to scratch an itch or peel a satsuma. But what do they reveal about your health?\n*\u00a0All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional. The BBC is not responsible or liable for any diagnosis made by a user based on the content of this site. The BBC is not liable for the contents of any external internet sites listed, nor does it endorse any commercial product or service mentioned or advised on any of the sites. Always consult your own GP if you're in any way concerned about your health.\u00a0\nThere's no shortage of folk wisdom about how to glean the state of your overall health from your nails, such as the pervasive idea that the white flecks that sometimes turn up \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are a sign of calcium deficiency. But is there any truth to these ideas?\nFirst up some basic anatomy. Nails are an extension of the skin. They are made from keratin, a super tough protein that shields the toes and tops of your fingers from trauma. The half-moon shape seen at the base of the nail is the lunula, which serves as the \"growth centre\" for the nail, producing the cells that will eventually harden into the nail plate . It sits above the cuticle, a layer of dead cells joining the base of the nailbed to the skin. The cuticle offers extra protection by acting as the nail's security guard, stopping bacteria, fungi and other pathogens in their tracks.\nWhile the eyes might be the windows to the soul, to a doctor the nails can be the windows to your health. Physicians can use them to diagnose all sorts of conditions, from dermatological problems to kidney disease or even autoimmune disorders.\n\"One of the first things I learned in medical school was to look for something called clubbing, where there is this loss of the angle between the nail and the nail bed itself,\" says Dan Baumgardt, a general practitioner in medicine and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol.\u00a0\nWith clubbing, the nail beds soften, and the nails almost seem to \"float\" instead of being firmly attached to the finger. The fingertips also appear large or bulging. \"It causes an unusual sort of swollen finger appearance where the finger looks a little bit like a drumstick,\" says Baumgardt.\nClubbing is a sign of extremely low blood oxygen levels. It is most commonly associated with lung cancer, but it can also indicate an infection of the lining of the heart chambers and heart valves, among other things. Other conditions where it is observed include celiac disease, cirrhosis of the liver and lung infections amongst others.\n\"If you do see a patient with clubbing the rule of thumb is to get them an x-ray as an urgency, because it could be an underlying lung cancer that could be explaining it,\" says Baumgardt. \"Having said that even though it's one of the first things that we learned in medical school. I really don't know why, because in all the 14 years I've been a doctor, I've only ever seen it once,\" he says.\nWhite flecks on the nail \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are often touted to be a sign of vitamin or mineral deficiencies. However, the evidence to support this is mixed. In one small study of undergraduates, there was no correlation between this symptom and a person's intake of either zinc or calcium. However, in one case report of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe leukonychia on his fingernails while deficient in selenium, it disappeared after treatment with this mineral.\nIn general, leukonychia are more likely to be a result of nail trauma. Stubbing your toe, trapping your fingernail in a door, too many manicures, or dropping a heavy object on your foot may cause such a mark.\nNevertheless, white discolouration on the nail could suggest an underlying health issue. For instance, white marks can be a sign of heavy metal poisoning with lead or arsenic. White discolouration of the nail could be a sign of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition that causes raised, inflamed, scaly patches of skin. If the entire nail turns white, this could suggest a deficiency of protein in the bloodstream, which can indicate kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If people have low protein levels in their bloodstream it [often] causes the whole nail to go white,\" says Baumgardt. \"We tend to associate that with people who've got liver disease, so things like cirrhosis of the liver, perhaps as a result of alcoholism.\"\u00a0\nBlue nails, on the other hand, are a sign that the body might be lacking oxygen. It could be a sign of serious heart disease or emphysema and is something you should get checked out by a doctor as soon as possible. This is also the case if you see dark lines underneath the nail, as although this can be caused by trauma, it could also be a sign of subungual melanoma, a rare but serious type of skin cancer.\nBleeding beneath the nail \u2013 if it doesn't heal \u2013 could also indicate something more serious. \"You can get what we call splinter haemorrhages, which look like little red streaks of blood, similar to if you imagine a splinter stuck under your nail,\" says Baumgardt. \"That haemorrhage can sometimes be suggestive of vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. One of the main underlying causes can be an infection of the heart valve, which causes these odd little red swellings,\" he says.\nOther, more common conditions can also be diagnosed by looking at the nails. When examining a patient, doctors typically look for alterations in colour, thickness and shape.\nFor example, in a healthy nail the underlying nail bed should be pink except for the white tips. Other colours could indicate an infection of the nail itself, or an underlying health condition.\n\"If you see either white or yellow discolouration on your toes, especially on your toenails, that is a sign of a fungal infection,\" says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull.\nAlthough in many countries, such as the US and the UK, you can buy over-the-counter topical medication for mild fungal nail infections, if you leave it too late then it can become more difficult to treat. (It's important to always consult a doctor if you suspect that you have a nail infection.)\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of the time when people have discolouration in the nails they don't realise that it's an infection, so it can get to a point where it becomes quite bad, and then they have to go and see a podiatrist,\" says Wilkinson.\nMeanwhile the shape of the nail can also reveal underlying problems. Healthy toe and fingernails should be convex, which means they curve slightly outwards. They shouldn't contain any dips or craters. If they do, it may be a sign that you have koilonychia, a condition where the nail curves inwards and looks thin and brittle. In some cases, people with koilonychia have a central depression in their nail deep enough to hold a drop of fluid, hence the condition is often referred to as \"spoon nails\".\u00a0\nIf your any of your nails bear a resemblance to a spoon, this could be a sign of anaemia, when the body doesn't have enough healthy blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency. However, it can also be a sign of coeliac disease, among other conditions.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, some changes in the nail can indicate nutritional deficiencies. Some people have horizontal ridges, known as Beau's lines, that run horizontally across their nails. This could indicate a deficiency such as insufficient protein. However, this feature could also be a sign of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease \u2013 a disorder involving reduced circulation of blood to certain parts of the body, usually due to the buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries \u2013 so it is still important to get it checked out.\n\"Beau's lines can indicate zinc deficiency, while brittle nails are a sign of hypothyroidism or vitamin B7 deficiency,\" says Mary Pearson, a paediatrician working at the University Hospital of Wales. \"In some cases we might be more diligent about looking for these, for example in safeguarding cases where we are concerned about a child's nutrition, or where we suspect chronic disease,\" she says.\nIn other cases, nail changes may be caused by lifestyle factors rather than health problems. For example peeling nails, also known as\u00a0onychoschizia, occurs when thin layers of the nails literally separate from the free nail edge and peel back. \"Onychoschizia may be the result of excessive hand washing, nail dryness, and the use of acrylics and other nail polishes,\" says Joshua Zeichner, professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital\u00a0in New York.\u00a0\nYou may wonder what it is about nails that makes them so revealing of a person's underlying health. One of the main reasons is that nails are obviously one of the few parts of the body that you can see from the outside.\n\"Nails are extensions of the skin, effectively, and your skin can tell you so much about what's going on in your body,\" says Baumgardt. \"Your first impression of a patient often starts from the bedside, so you look them all over and you start off with their nails, you look in their eyes and their mouth. And you start to do an end-of-the-bed assessment, trying to pick out diagnostic pictures from that point early on. So nails are one of the first things we see,\" he says.\nWhile most of the time changes in the nail are harmless, and are simply down to a nail injury, if you notice that the change in shape, colour, or texture is more permanent, then you should always consult the advice of a doctor.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the chancellor's online CV, and the use of expenses while working at a bank, in the wake of a BBC News investigation.\nRachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.\nIt was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nSir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter. \nThe initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.\nWe have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.\nA spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.\n\nBBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP\nIn a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.\nThe prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".\nHe said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.\nShe posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"\nRachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.\nThe chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.\nOn the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.\nHowever, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.\nThey said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.\nSpeaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.\nAsked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"\nThe Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.\nReeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006\nThe rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.\nA photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.\nA former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.\nIn a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"\nIn a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\" \nShe said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.\nThe claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".\nAs she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nLast year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.\nReeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.\nShe stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.\nThe chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.\nIn fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement.

        "article_text": "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the latest move in a row between the Trump administration and career US attorneys. \nSeven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case. \nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News on Friday that it was her understanding that the case against Adams would be \"dismissed today\". \nAdams was indicted last year on fraud and bribery charges. He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe request to drop the charges will require approval by a judge.\nEarlier in the week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove - Bondi's second-in-command - ordered the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office to end the case.\nBove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. \nThe motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case \"would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies\".\nBut several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.   \nSassoon resigned from her post on Thursday and was followed by six of her colleagues.\nShe said dropping the case would set a \"breathtaking and dangerous precedent\".\nThe latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for \"using prosecutorial power\" to influence elected officials.\n\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\nIn a letter accepting Sassoon's resignation, Bove said his office would be investigating the attorney, claiming she had \"lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice\". \nIn a statement, Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle defended the decision to dismiss the charges, saying it showed \"that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\".\nMr Mizelle said that prosecutors who refuse direct orders \"have no place\" in the department.\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. \nIn Sassoon's resignation letter, she also said  Adams' lawyers had met justice department officials and asked for a \"quid pro quo\", saying the New York City mayor could help enforce Trump's immigration policies if the case against him was dismissed.\nBut Adams denied that was the case. \n\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered - nor did anyone offer on my behalf - any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\nAdams, a Democrat, has accused investigators of pursuing a politically motivated case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\nThe New York mayor has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he won the White House. He flew to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida days before the Republican president took office. \nAfter a meeting with US border tsar Tom Homan on Thursday, Adams said he would agree to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to re-establish an office at the city's Rikers Island jail. \nTrump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the case against Adams. \nBut Bove's letter described his instructions to drop the case as \"direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\".\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.\nWhile she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was \"consulting with other leaders in government at this time\". \n\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious,\" she said. \"But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction.\"",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The 'missing middle' of small businesses\n\u2022\u00a0Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love\n\u2022\u00a0Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things\nWhere do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?\nMy perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.\nI'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "These tiny soldiers can eat four times their own weight in organic waste \u2013 and turn it into sustainable fertiliser.\nWith a unique ability to consume nearly any form of organic matter it comes across, one small but mighty insect is becoming a tool to address the growing problem of organic waste and soil degradation. The bug, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), transforms food waste into nutrient-rich biofertiliser: frass.\nInsects have been long been used in agricultural practices as a food source \u2013 but now farmers are exploring the potential of bug poo as a sustainable fertiliser. With over 33% of the world's soil currently degraded, depleted of the nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth, frass can play a major role in restoring soil biodiversity and quality.\u00a0\nIn May 2024, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded grants to three projects that seek to harness this soldier fly's capabilities. This included Chapul Farms, an Oregon-based project development company that's reweaving insects back into American agriculture to eliminate food waste, restore soil health, and produce high-quality animal feed.\nBacked by the Fertilizer Production and Expansion Program (FPEP), the bipartisan support of the use of insects in agriculture highlights the growing recognition of BSFL's potential \u2013 for both waste reduction and for enhancing soil health through the production of high quality domestic fertiliser.\nBut despite the bug's seeming superpowers, the widespread application of BSFL remains limited. The question is: why? And how can companies like Chapul Farms, now equipped with federal support, change that?\nBSFL can consume nearly any kind of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. Facilities like Chapul Farms utilise its voracious appetite to process large quantities of waste, with the larvae consuming up to\u00a0four times their own body waste in organic matter everyday. This happens in a fraction of the time required for traditional composting, which can take up to 10 months. The larvae's efficiency allows for a rapid turnover of organic material into nutrient-rich excrement \u2013 or frass.\n\"They can reproduce pretty quickly too,\" says Shankar Ganapathi Shanmugam, Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University. \"And it [BSFL] grows on dead and decaying material, which means that it can survive on waste.\"\nShanmugam is spearheading research on the use of frass as a crop nutrient, which until now has not been studied in the US \u2013 though it has been studied in other parts of the world, notably in multiple countries across\u00a0Europe.\nChapul collaborates with neighbouring farms to exchange waste for frass, creating a circular system. It's a mutually beneficial exchange as the farms receive nutrient-rich soil amendment and Chapul receives the fuel for their operation. And it's doing something significant for insect populations too: helping to repopulate them.\nThis is because insect farming operations create a controlled environment for the bugs to thrive. The frass created from them\u00a0provides essential nutrients\u00a0to plants and fosters a more biodiverse soil, which encourages the growth of native plant and insect species, thus supporting the overall ecosystem.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"We could make compost out of anything but the impact of running it through this insect biology has all of these [positive] implications,\" says Mimi Casteel, an Oregon wine farmer who has been using Chapul's frass. \"It's exciting for so many reasons: it's a portable, pretty low cost investment compared to some other things that we're considering as part of dealing with our massive problems with waste, and soldier flies are replacing a missing layer of diversity.\"\nChapul has worked with local vineyards, researchers and farms to research, educate and promote frass benefits and adoption in the bioregion. TAINABLE, a local soil restoration non-profit, provides laboratory space and farmland to Chapul for their research.\nAs organic waste production continues to place a massive burden on energy and carbon emissions, there is an increasing need for more efficient and sustainable processing methods. And BSFL's digestive processes can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"Finding a use for this is important, but if you're going to market frass as a fertiliser, you need to regulate it, which takes time,\" says Shanmugam. \"And to make these regulations you need research.\"\nThe US National Organic Program does not include insects as an acceptable additive as of now. This makes it a challenge to share this technique with farmers who use organic practices, though teams like Chapul Farms are in conversations with regulators to increase education around it and usher in its inclusion.\nUnlike chemical fertilisers, which often deplete soil over time, frass promotes biodiversity within the soil by introducing a diverse microbial community. This boosts soil resilience, natural plant defence, improves its ability to retain water, and reduces the need for costly synthetic inputs. In sharp contrast, synthetics can wreck soil biodiversity, beneficial bacteria and the soil's natural micro-ecosystem, leaving it dependent on increasingly expensive inputs. They also have intensive fossil-fuel requirements, and reduce soil's carbon carrying capacity.\n\"We recently saw even more of a push for our government to get projects funded that support domestic fertiliser production,\" says Aly Moore, Chief Communications Officer of Chapul Farms. \"We realise how many health issues are caused by the reduced nutrient density in crops, and all the pesticides used. And on the cost factor, farmers will not only need less fertiliser over time, but also fewer pesticides.\"\nThis can all contribute to cost savings and be more incentive for farmers, especially at a time when fertiliser prices are sky high and supply is unreliable. Prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. With the US being the world's third-largest fertiliser importer, American farmers felt the brunt of this impact; making it not just a fertiliser issue, but also one of food security.\n\"In the two years leading up to 2023, there was an 8% reduction in global fertiliser consumption, because people were priced out of the market,\" says Michael Place, Chief Technology Officer at Chapul Farms. \"There were supply disruptions and even unavailability. And FPEP emerged from this sort of emergency.\"\nSoil microbes present an exciting frontier for regenerating soil health, yet less than 1% of total microbes in soil have been cultivated. Frass provides an opportunity to pivot from the reductionist methods of treating soils that perpetuated the soil crisis in the first place, all while bolstering food and agricultural security.\nFarmers will eventually need less frass to maintain the same levels of soil productivity, as the microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health and resiliency by improving biodiversity.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 A 2,000-year-old method to water crops\n\u2022 The ignored potential of human poo\nFarmers who have begun using frass in their fields are already reporting promising results.\u00a0Casteel is in the midst of facilitating trials to assess the impact of frass on her crops. While the statistical outcome of the study is still in progress, she has already witnessed perceptible changes.\n\"Anecdotally, what I can tell you is that in the trials that I've done both with grapevines and in my vegetable farm, the produce itself comes up faster, it has better cellular structure,\" says Casteel. \"So if you actually cut the leaf and put it under the microscope, the cells grow more densely and they have figure lipid membranes. And what that means is that the plant from day one has more structural integrity,\" she says.\nThe FPEP funds will support construction and equipment for BSFL facilities located in Oregon and North Dakota. The projects anticipate yielding 10,000 tons of frass per location per year and will generate 59 new jobs, upon its opening which is expected to be in 2026.\u00a0\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the nascent insect agriculture industry is the tunnel vision around insects for protein production which has overshadowed the benefits of frass in soil health. While protein from BSFL is a lucrative and fast-growing market, frass remains an underutilised resource in insect agriculture.\nThe global insect protein market was valued at nearly $1 billion in 2022 (\u00a3805m), while global frass was valued at $96 million (\u00a377m) in 2023, and frass's projected growth is substantially higher. Plus, according to the Chapul Farms team, insect farms produce twice as much frass as larvae.\u00a0\n\"I think farmers have historically been convinced that insects are problems, and they just don't want to talk about adding more problems to their situation,\" says Casteel. \"But when our farms become more complex, you start to see an exponential rollout of ecological returns.\"\u00a0\nIn addition, insects are keystone species, meaning entire ecosystems would drastically change or collapse without them \u2013 and our world would \"grind to a halt\", as the biologist Dave Goulson\u00a0wrote in the Guardian newspaper.\u00a0\n\"Ultimately, at its core, we cannot survive without insects,\" says Pat Crowley, CEO of Chapul Farms. \"Natural ecosystems cannot flourish... without the insects as a part of them. And that's one of our biggest premises. It's not as simple as: insects will solve the biggest trends in global agricultural health. And at the same time, I think it's one of the biggest levers that we have in making agriculture a more resilient, ecosystem-based model.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.\nA night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How opera can be 'open to everyone'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is the 'land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera House cut ties with its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to a UK study conducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work \u2013 and opera houses are no exception.\nThe pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive the Theatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes \u2013 sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations \u2013 spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.\nA key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. \"Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,\" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentary Take Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne. \n\u00a0\nIn 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: \"I know that many opera companies\u2026 don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.\"\nGlyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the global Race to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. \"We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,\" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. \"We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine.\" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. \"Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,\" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. \"This way everything goes back into the ground.\"\nClimate action\nGlyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.\nThe rooftop of the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, for example, is host to an urban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.\nThe Sydney Opera House \u2013 a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 \u2013 has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021, a survey by the UK's Theatres Trust found that it would cost more than \u00a31bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.\nIn the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than \u00a0630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recent New York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting.\nElsewhere, the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon, G\u00f6teborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on a new project investigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first \"green season\", using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new \"eco-entertainment\" work titled Masque of Might.\nAs the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.\nTake Me to the Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne is on BBC News Channel and on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "Scientists and industry are finding unusual new uses for brewers' spent grain \u2013 the beer industry's largest waste product.\nPonder the idea of a beer well-brewed and enthusiastic drinkers at least are likely to imagine a pint glass filled to the brim with golden nectar.\u00a0\nWhat they probably won't picture is the mountains of wet sticky shavings that pile up as the largest waste material of brewing beer.\nThis is what's known as brewers' spent grain, and there is an awful lot of it. Around 200g (7oz) is produced for every litre of beer brewed. Globally some 37 million tonnes is produced each year \u2013 equivalent to the weight of around 340 double-decker buses per hour. And as we drink more beer \u2013 sales are expected to rise by a third in the next seven years \u2013 only more and more will be churned out.\nMost brewers' spent grain, around 70% of it, is currently repurposed as cattle feed, while 10% is used to make biogas. Around a fifth is simply sent straight to landfill \u2013 at an additional cost to breweries \u2013 where it rots and releases methane into the atmosphere.\nBut inside this beer by-product there are a mountain of useful chemicals to tap, including lots of protein. Researchers and companies are now beginning to explore how these could be put to better use.\u00a0\nSwiss start-up Upgrain is one of these. In 2024, it launched a processing system to turn brewers' spent grain into protein and fibre, passed as fit for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and the European Food Safety Authority (brewers' spent grain is, after all, still just grain). The system comes ready for installation on brewery premises: shipping container-sized for micro-breweries and a much larger unit for the likes of Brauerei Locher, Switzerland's second biggest brewer, which opened in September 2024 and is now building Europe's largest onsite facility.\nWilliam Beiskjaer, Upgrain's co-founder, argues brewers spent grain is a \"kind of hidden treasure in terms of sustainable and healthy nutrition\". He says it could help to tackle rising global demand for protein. \"There's more and more demand for our foods to be enhanced, especially to get more protein and fibre in our diets,\" he says.\nUpgrain and other producers such as Agrain in Denmark and BiaSol in Ireland are already selling brewers' spent grain protein and fibre extract to food manufacturers for inclusion in baked goods, pizzas, granola and even crisps. It's also being used in plant-based meat alternatives, such as those launched last year by the Swiss supermarket chain Migros, and in a coffee created by Singapore-based company Prefer.\nHype Metre\nBrewers' spent grain is a rich source of nutrients which is arguably wasted as cattle feed and produces methane when it ends up in landfill. A host of start-ups are now using it to make everything from vegan barley milk and leather to baked goods, crisps and even coffee; it even has potential to be used in areas like construction, cosmetics and paper.\nNot all these products are yet past the early stages of development, and products could struggle to see widespread consumer acceptance. Brewers' spent grain also uses lots of energy to process and spoils fast. Scientists and developers are already working to overcome these issues, however.\nHuge brewers such as the Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev and Chicago-based Molson Coors have even created their own vegan barley milk spin-offs made from spent grain. Molson Coors claims its Golden Wing product has a \"rich and creamy taste\" and 25% less sugar than most oat milks.\u00a0\n\"This is an exciting new idea,\" says Beiskjaer. \"If you'd have said to me four years ago that brewers' spent grain would be a [human] food source, I'd have asked what you were talking about. But we're on the way to seeing upcycled BSG as a staple in the food industry.\"\nBeiskjaer says he can see why some people may be squeamish about the notion of \"upcycled food\". \"But we have to get across the idea that brewers' spent grain is not a\u00a0waste\u00a0product,\" he says. \"It's being saved from being a waste product.\"\nMaking use of this waste product to make plant-based protein could in theory also free up the small amounts of arable farmland used to grow wheat, soy and pea for human protein \u2013 or, if it replaced meat, a far larger amount of land. \u00c4io, a biotech start-up based in Tallin, Estonia is using brewers' spent grain and other food and agricultural waste products to develop an alternative to palm oil, a major driver of deforestation in Indonesia and other countries. To do this \u00c4io grows fatty acid-making microorganisms and applies these to a fermentation process not dissimilar to that used in brewing beer.\nThere are some caveats to using brewers' spent grain in food, however. Since it is loaded with moisture and so spoils quickly, using it close to where it is produced is essential. This is one reason why a good proportion ends up in landfill: there's not enough demand from local farmers to meet supply. That dampness risks mould and microbial infection. In fact, says Beiskjaer, \"it becomes the perfect environment for bacteria unless it's quickly preserved\". Techniques for making preservation easier are now being explored.\nBut nutrition isn't the only area where spent grain could make an impact.\nBrett Cotten concedes that early efforts by his young London-based company, Arda Biomaterials, to create leather-alternatives from brewers' spent grain resulted in something more akin to a flapjack.\u00a0\nBut the start-up has since successfully used supramolecular chemistry to make several proteins from brewers' spent grain that mimic the animal proteins in leather, resulting in a strong and supple alternative. The colour reflects the spent grain used, he says. \"Guinness and stouts make for a naturally black material, IPAs and lagers more mid-browns.\"\u00a0\nCotten argues that to date many leather alternatives have either not been as environmentally sound as promised or are not scalable enough to replace animal leather. In contrast, he says, Arda's first test material was made in a home lab using standard kitchen equipment, using the abundant feedstock that is brewers' spent grain.\nSo far staff at the company and a local brewery have wear-trialled this new material with bags and cardholders. Current production is at lab scale, but a pilot facility set to open in London in 2025 will allow it to produce up to 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) a year, the company says.\nArda's own estimates suggest that, were a facility tied to a single major brewing plant \u2013 the likes of one run by Heineken or InBev \u2013 all of the spent grain being produced by the plant could make for 5-10 million sq m (54,000-108 sq ft) of its mid-range faux-leather, suitable for use in fashion and the automotive upholstery industries. Tied to, say, three major brewing facilities, it could undercut the cost of both real and plastics-based synthetic leathers, it argues. Cotten estimates that just 10% of global brewers' spent grain output would satisfy the global demand for leather.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Of course, the look and feel [of our material] is important, but so is scalability,\" says Cotten. \"The fashion industry just wants a new option [to animal or current bioleathers]. And while it's often happy to work with a batch of proof-of-concept material for a small collection, you have to be able to produce at scale to be of real interest.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The controversial device trapping CO2 in the ocean\n\u2022 What we've learned since Deepwater Horizon\n\u2022 The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery\nThat comes with a cost, however. Processing brewers' spent grain typically involves mechanical methods \u2013 using high pressure and temperature and spinning the grain in a centrifuge \u2013 or the use of strong acids and alkalis, all of which\u00a0are energy-intensive and can raise their own environmental questions. There is therefore an ongoing exploration of cheaper and more sophisticated methods to extract protein from spent grain, such as the use of bacteria and fungal enzymes to break down chemical bonds, for example.\u00a0\nLast year, a team in Singapore, funded by Heineken Asia, unveiled the use of fermentation to break down the chemical bonds in spent grain, which also resulted in the extracted protein \u2013 for use in foodstuffs \u2013 being richer in nutrients and fatty acids. In another step that might be widely applied, the researchers heated the spent grain using microwaves and found they could extract over 80% of its available protein content this way, the most harvested to date.\n\"Using microwaves is a difficult challenge, in their energy requirements, efficiency and scalability,\" says William Chen, professor of food science and technology at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore. \"But it's certainly possible to scale up [a microwave approach], or to find other ways of applying heat, through vibration, for example.\"\nThe overall objective is to move towards an \"ever more functional, higher value products\", he says. \"And we should be doing the same with [other protein-rich waste products such as] soybean residue, for example,\" he adds.\nArda's experiments may prove to be just the first steps in exploring the potential of spent grain beyond the edible. Antioxidant-rich brewers' spent grain could provide an eco-friendly alternative to the chemicals used in cosmetics, for instance, or used to replace the virgin fibres used in paper making.\u00a0\nRosa Arrigo, associate professor in inorganic chemistry at the University of Salford in the UK, says brewers' spent grain has a \"niche composition that's rich in chemicals [that] certainly have potential to [in time] be used to produce new materials\". Work at Salford to extract various organic compounds from brewers' spent grain is ongoing and Arrigo envisages these being used to make robust composite materials that could, for example, be bindable to the likes of concrete to make it stronger, more lightweight and more sustainable.\u00a0\n\"Certainly there's a whole other layer to what brewers' spent grain could bring beyond protein extraction for food,\" says Arrigo. \"Exactly what that is what we're now starting to examine.\" Doing this, though, could be expensive and complex, she adds. \"So we need further investigation to understand really what we have here, and what's actually needed by industry: what's good enough in terms of its quality but also economically feasible.\"\u00a0\nThe development of one such material is already underway: a group of researchers coordinated by University of Perugia, Italy, is currently working on a bioplastic derived from brewers' spent grain.\nCurrently, spent grain usually needs to be dried before it can be further processed, which is both time and energy consuming. But the Perugia team has developed a means of processing it while wet, critical to developing a bioplastic that could improve on the mechanical properties of those already available. The so-called Polymeer project hopes to have its first product \u2013 perhaps a biodegradable film wrap that could be used in packaging and agriculture \u2013 within four years.\n\"I think the true potential of brewers' spent grain has been overlooked, because even when the protein is removed there's still a lot of [useful] waste, the likes of lignin and cellulose, that has the potential to be a raw material [for other purposes],\" says Assunta Marrocchi associate professor in biotechnology at the University of Perugia and Polymeer's project coordinator. \"And the extraction of its additional components seems to be possible by relatively easy, low energy methods.\"\nBut what really matters here she adds, is that \"because almost everyone drinks beer, there's just so much of it to work with. It really is an incredible feedstock\".\nSo, the next time you're in the pub, perhaps you'll find yourself considering how the undertaking that put the beer in your glass might just prove an unexpected game-changer to both our diets and the materials we use.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Copenhagen's once-industrial port has been planned to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes.\nWhile cruising the canals of Copenhagen in the summer of 2023, my guide pointed out Nordhavn, the city's once-industrial neighbourhood, excitedly claiming it would become the coolest new city in Europe. From the boat, I couldn't see much beyond a few residential buildings and lots of giant construction machinery, but, as an architect, I was interested to know more.\nSo, 12 months later, I returned to Copenhagen and headed back to Nordhavn, just a 15-minute metro ride from Copenhagen's central station.\u00a0\nThis time, standing at \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, the core of the new development, I could see gleaming apartment buildings, high-end office spaces and a cafe-lined boardwalk along the previously industrial harbour. Dozens of people were lying on colourful beach towels spread across the waterfront, all soaking in the Scandinavian summer sun. It was a peaceful, serene scene, with none of the morning commuter chaos I was used to seeing in cities around the world.\nAnd that's because Nordhavn has been specifically designed to make life easier.\n\"Although it looks like any modern district, it's the world's first five-minute city,\" explained my guide, Bente Hoffman from immersive cultural tour company Slow Tours. \"When the project is complete, everything you need will be within a 400m walk.\"\nCommuting is one of the biggest challenges of modern life as it adds so much time into the daily routine. Nordhavn (officially a district of Copenhagen, but described as a city due to its scale and scope) has been designed to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes. It is setting a blueprint for a world where residents can fit in a morning workout before strolling to the office, grab lunch at a cute cafe, have a quick swim at the harbour and still make it home in time to take your kids to the playground \u2013 all before enjoying a cosy candlelit dinner at home.\nImagine doing all of this without driving from one point to another, without feeling exhausted, and being able to repeat it every day while staying carbon neutral.\n\"We are creating a neighbourhood that meets everyday needs and special occasions,\" explained Peter Bur Andersen, an architect from BRIQ Studios that played a crucial role in zoning Nordhavn. \"Everything is within walking or biking distance, minimising the need for commuting. The area also promotes a mostly car-free lifestyle, connected by cycle paths and the metro.\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nCopenhagen is currently the Unesco World's Architecture Capital (until 2026) and innovative solutions for smart living have been brewing across the Danish capital: from Paper Island, designed to focus on public spaces and housing for all income groups; to Carlsberg City District that's built on four pillars of beer production: science, innovation, art and culture.\nHowever, Nordhavn's five-minute city concept is unique. While there are a few 10-minute cities being developed around the world, including one in Seoul, South Korea, Nordhavn's one-of-a-kind concept is the most ambitious urban development project in Scandinavia. It is also the only new urban district anywhere in the world to receive a gold certification for sustainability from the German Sustainable Building Council, or DGNB (the largest network for sustainable building in Europe), according to Andersen.\nIn Nordhavn, sustainability is about more than reducing energy consumption. Every building constructed must consider its social, economic and environmental impact. For example, the Big Bio Cinema \u2013 the city's newest theatre \u2013 is constructed from recyclable materials such as aluminium in case the building ever needs to be demolished.\nTop tips:\nWhen to go: June-August for warmer weather.\nWhat to do: Take a guided walking tour. Explore the design shops in the harbour area. Head to Konditaget L\u00fcders, a carpark rooftop that serves as an open-air public gym. Watch a movie at Big Bio Cinema.\nWhere to stay: Audo House, a former warehouse transformed into a boutique hotel with a caf\u00e9 and concept store.\nWhere to eat:\n- Located on the 17th floor of a former grain silo, Restaurant Silo has impressive views and a seasonal menu.\n- Headed by Rosio Sanchez, a former dessert chef from Noma, Hija de Sanchez Cantina\u00a0is a two-minute walk from the Sandkaj Harbour.\n- Palmar\u00e8s Bike Caf\u00e9 is a unique spot for cyclists, offering coffee, croissants and a bike workshop, with bike parts as d\u00e9cor.\nAnd, according to Anderson, social and economic inclusion has been at the core of all planning. \"It is important to bring back what worked well in history,\" he said. \"We used to have the butcher, craftsman, baker and cheese shop \u2013 that diversity in everyday encounters. The future city should mix recreational, cultural and commercial spaces, all easily accessible within the neighbourhood.\"\nBut until relatively recently, no one would have considered living in this once-industrial district. Irshia Nasreen, an engineer born and raised in central Copenhagen, says, \"While I was trying to find a new neighbourhood to move out of the city centre, I never thought I'd move here.\"\nBente adds, \"I didn't think I would do tourist walks in Norhavn. There was nothing to see.\"\nAfter all, for centuries Nordhavn was a free port filled with cargo ships, grain silos and metal containers. The buildings that existed were warehouses and industrial shipping structures. Then, in 2008, a competition was held to create a sustainable neighbourhood for Copenhagen's future: 179 proposals were submitted and a group of four architectural firms, COBE Architects, Sleth, Ramb\u00f8ll and Polyform were winners.\nThey designed an urban area of \"soft mobility\", where it is easier to walk, bike or use public transport than it is to drive; and put the idea of hybrid spaces \u2013 something that \"avoids creating lifeless spaces and fosters community among residents, employees and visitors\", according to Andersen \u2013 at its heart. For example, in Nordhavn, a multi-storey car park might have a gym on its roof; an apartment building could include a public restaurant; and a hotel could house a concept store.\nAlthough the entire Nordhavn project won't be finished until 2060, it is being developed in islets (small islands), with key areas such as Nord\u00f8 and \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, already complete and full of life, brimming with locals and tourists. A metro extension to Nordhavn and Orientkaj opened in 2020, providing easy access from the city centre.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0Kamikochi: Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n\u2022\u00a0How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nAs Hoffman and I walked through Nord\u00f8, I admired the ingenuity of using once-unassuming buildings to create chic destinations. Audo House, a warehouse from 1918, is now a boutique hotel, concept store and cafe. Across the road, MENY food supermarket was once a factory for building guns. Because of the building's protected status, MENY had to use the same walls, windows and ceilings as the former World War Two gun factory to create what is now a futuristic food market. Nearby, the raw steel surface of The Silo still resembled its days as a grain silo. But it has now been transformed into a luxurious 17-storey residential building with a public restaurant.\n\"The beauty of Nordhavn lies in the blend of old and new architecture standing side by side,\" said Hoffman. \"Sustainability is also about preserving the past by repurposing old buildings for modern use.\"\nNasreen moved to Nordhavn in 2023 and says the calm, car-free environment has transformed her lifestyle. \"I love walking around here,\" she said. \"After living in the city centre for 40 years, not hearing the hums of vehicles is refreshing. The proximity of water to all residential areas gives a sense of peace and fresh air. My nephew is awed by the fact that he can swim in the harbour, walk back home for a shower and then go back to the waterfront to enjoy coffee in a cool caf\u00e9. Isn't that amazing?\"\nCarbon emissions:\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 1.57 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nShe added: \"I work from home, and when I need a change of scenery, I head to The Audo House.

A century later, Hoffman is leading curious designers and architects like me on walking tours around Nordhavn. As curious as I am, and perhaps with the same intent, they are looking for answers to the question: can architecture be one of the keys to creating a happier urban environment?\u00a0\nFor Nasreen and many others living in Nordhavn, the answer is a resounding yes.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

But it has now been transformed into a luxurious 17-storey residential building with a public restaurant.Shalbha SardaBuildings have been designed as multifunctional spaces to foster community (Credit: Shalbha Sarda)\"The beauty of Nordhavn lies in the blend of old and new architecture standing side by side,\" said Hoffman. \"Green GetawaysGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.Copenhagen is currently the Unesco World's Architecture Capital (until 2026) and innovative solutions for smart living have been brewing across the Danish capital: from Paper Island, designed to focus on public spaces and housing for all income groups; to Carlsberg City District that's built on four pillars of beer production: science, innovation, art and culture.Getty ImagesEvery building constructed must consider its social, economic and environmental impact (Credit: Getty Images)However, Nordhavn's five-minute city concept is unique. Nordhavn (officially a district of Copenhagen, but described as a city due to its scale and scope) has been designed to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes. For example, in Nordhavn, a multi-storey car park might have a gym on its roof; an apartment building could include a public restaurant; and a hotel could house a concept store.Although the entire Nordhavn project won't be finished until 2060, it is being developed in islets (small islands), with key areas such as Nord\u00f8 and \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, already complete and full of life, brimming with locals and tourists.",

        "article_text": "The Uzbekistan government is on an ambitious tourism drive \u2013 but is sparring with heritage experts over how to protect its historical sites.\nThe sound of a jackhammer rattles through the air. In Bukhara, a former trading hub on the ancient Silk Road in what is now Uzbekistan, tourism is the new commerce and new hotels are popping up on every street corner. I've counted three construction sites in a 100m radius outside the former caravanserai where I'm staying, and I observe the progress of a guesthouse being built just metres from a 16th-Century madrasa (school).\u00a0\nIt's a trend that's visible across the country. In the capital, Tashkent, construction work for a shopping mall lines the avenue leading up to the Hazrati Imam mosque complex, next to the shiny, almost-completed Centre for Islamic Civilisation. The small historic city of Khiva, surrounded by mud fortifications, cannot expand outwards \u2013 but mud-and-straw residences in the historic centre are being knocked down and replaced by modern hotels. It is perhaps most obvious in Samarkand, where billionaire businessman Bakhtiyor Fazilov has poured money into flashy projects to raise his home city's profile, such as a new airline, an international airport that opened in 2022 and the strange Disneyland facsimile Silk Road Samarkand, a soulless and sanitised tourist resort situated outside the city.\n\"The concept of the Silk Road is being applied to everything,\" said Svetlana Gorshenina, a researcher and member of the Uzbek heritage protection association Alerte H\u00e9ritage. \"You have Silk Road restaurants, Silk Road shops, Silk Road tours, tourist agencies uniquely dedicated to the Silk Road. It has become our only selling point and it's self-exoticising. It's a kind of self-orientalisation, which is a hangover from colonialism.\"\u00a0\nThe thing is: it's working. The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index now ranks Uzbekistan at 78th out of 119 countries, moving up 16 places in the last five years. The Uzbek government is ploughing investment into its tourism sector after the country's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, laid out his Uzbekistan 2030 strategy in September 2023, an enormous governmental plan detailing the goals to be achieved in various sectors by that date. That includes increasing the number of foreign tourists to 15 million, more than double the 6.6 million visitors to the country in 2023. He has also called for the creation of \"tourist clusters\" \u2013 complexes providing accommodation and other services for tourists in one place.\u00a0\nOne of these new clusters is the reason I've come to Bukhara. It's a 33-hectare site on the fringes of the old town on which a leisure complex called\u00a0Eternal Bukhara\u00a0will soon be built. Samarkand tycoon Fazilov has a hand in this project too: he's the chairman of one of Uzbekistan's largest contractors, Enter Engineering, which is building the complex. The company is cagey about its actual plans for the site \u2013 not least because it has already proven quite contentious.\nInitial plans reported in the local press described it as an \"ethnographic park\" that would recreate traditional Uzbek buildings such as\u00a0chaikhanas\u00a0(teahouses), as well as restaurants serving Uzbek cuisine and a museum about Uzbek culture. But the 3D renderings pasted on the high walls that surround the construction site show instead blocky, modernist shopping arcades and glimmering pools adorned with abstract art.\u00a0\n\"We're not trying to replicate historic buildings. We don't want to repeat history \u2013 but to create something that will have its own impact,\" Rustam Khaydarov, the deputy general director of Enter Engineering, told me, as we sat in a portacabin in the construction site with excavators and diggers whirring nearby. \"It will be a place where people can relax, with cafes and a cultural centre for local artists to display their art. And about 70% of it will remain a green site.\"\nEnter Engineering also plans to build a number of five-star hotels, with up to 700 rooms on site. \"Wealthy people already come to Bukhara but are dissatisfied with the quality of the hotels. So we want to improve the class of hotels on offer,\" he said. There will also be medical facilities to cater to a new type of tourist that Uzbekistan is trying to attract: visitors who come for cheap healthcare, from dentistry to plastic surgery.\nThis area used to be Bukhara's administrative zone, with government offices and a large public sports arena. The demolition of the sports stadium im 2024 provoked a public outcry (which is rare in Uzbekistan, a country where public dissent is swiftly silenced), and Enter Engineering responded by building three more sports facilities on the town's outskirts. The site is ringed by a road, beyond which there are drab and semi-dilapidated residential apartment blocks, with many ground-floor spaces for businesses unoccupied. Although it's just a short walk to Bukhara's tourist sites and monuments, it feels a world away from the relentless tourism of the city centre.\nGet off the tourist trail\nMany travellers head from Samarkand to Khiva but don't hesitate to go off the beaten path. Here are some ideas:\n\u2022\u00a0Rent a car or book a tour to visit the ancient Khorezm fortresses and Zoroastrian sites on the road between Nukus and Urgench, where you can scramble around the desert ruins, poke into chambers and walk along walls that were built between the 4th Century BCE and the 7th Century CE.\n\u2022\u00a0The city of Nukus is a rapidly developing tourist destination, known above all for the Nukus Museum of Art's extensive collection of Russian avant-garde art.\n\u2022 Go to the Fergana Valley for a slower pace of travel. Spending time in a teahouse in a rural mountain village will give you a better understanding of how people live in Uzbekistan.\n\"For years, Uzbekistan has been undergoing a process of emptying city centres of their inhabitants,\" explained Gorshenina. \"We are witnessing a transformation of towns into museum-towns that are made for tourists. In Bukhara, you already have this 'tourist zone' that is clearly separate from the rest of the town where residents live. It's become an open-air museum.\"\nAn Uzbek architect, who did not want to be named for this article but whom I met in his office in Bukhara, told me, \"Every year, there are more and more tourists. I have always thought of Bukhara as a living organism, and that organism is becoming very weak and fragile. It should not become a town solely for tourists but for its residents as well. It risks becoming a Venice in the desert.\"\nAlerte H\u00e9ritage is fiercely opposed to the Eternal Bukhara project, in part because it says that locals were not consulted about the use of the space, and also because of the loss of important Soviet-era architecture, such as a government building that was the former regional headquarters of the Communist Party, built in 1987. It was torn down in early 2024.\nThe Uzbek architect said that the current government was repeating mistakes from the Soviet era. \"The Soviet Union destroyed a lot of heritage and replaced it with Soviet buildings because it wanted to leave its own imprint. That tradition of demolition is still \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 in our blood.\"\nAlthough Eternal Bukhara is not within the historical centre that is classified as a Unesco World Heritage site, it falls within the \"buffer zone\", which still requires Unesco validation before urban changes can be made. When contacted, a spokesperson for Unesco, said that they were \"closely monitoring\" the situation, adding: \"We hope that the authorities will comply with their commitments to the World Heritage Convention and that they will not carry out any demolition/construction project without the prior assessment of the World Heritage Committee in July 2025.\"\nDemolition on the Eternal Bukhara site is visibly ongoing, with only a handful of buildings still standing. That seems problematic for Unesco \u2013 even more so as the international organisation plans to host this year's General Conference in Uzbekistan, which would be the first time since 1986 that the annual meeting has been held outside Paris.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Central Asia's glittering new Silk Road jewel\n\u2022\u00a0 Plov: Uzbekistan's rice dish with 'sexual power'\n\u2022\u00a0 The Silk Road city most tourists miss\n\"Unesco is toothless, without principles. What has it really done for Central Asia, for Uzbekistan?\" asked the Uzbek architect. Both he and Alerte H\u00e9ritage are unconvinced by Unesco's warnings to Enter Engineering. Khaydarov, however, assured me that the company will not launch any building work until they get Unesco's green light \u2013 which means that they could still be waiting for months before construction is able to begin.\n\"We don't want the city's image to be damaged,\" Khaydarov said. \"This is a reputational issue. But we chose this area because it's in the buffer zone and we are confident we will get Unesco's approval to continue.\"\nHe also insisted that locals support the plans, describing it as \"a social project\" rather than a commercial one. \"We will create minimum 15,000 jobs with this site,\" he promised.\nUzbekistan's headlong rush into the world of mass tourism could well create thousands of jobs and boost the country's economy \u2013 but it risks bulldozing or damaging both the country's ancient heritage and vestiges of its more recent history. You only have to walk through Bukhara's covered bazaars that were once filled with Uzbek silk and crafts and are now teeming with imported, mass-produced goods to get a feel for what the country may look like in just a few years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings.

A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

        "article_text": "There's a new race in space, but it's not where you might think. It's happening close to home \u2013 in the nearest bit of space, right on the edge of Earth's atmosphere.\nHigh in the skies of Earth, a new space race is underway. Here, just above the boundary where space begins, companies are trying to create a new class of daring satellites. Not quite high-altitude planes and not quite low-orbiting satellites, these sky skimmers are designed to race around our planet in an untapped region, with potentially huge benefits on offer.\nRoughly 10,000 satellites are orbiting our planet right now, at speeds of up to 17,000mph (27,000km/h). Every one of these delicate contraptions is in constant free-fall and would drop straight back down to Earth were it not for the blistering speeds at which they travel. It's their considerable sideways momentum, perfectly stabilised against the Earth's gravitational pull downwards, that keeps satellites in orbit.\nA new class of satellites is aiming to push the limits of this balancing act and plough a much more precarious, lower orbit that would skim the top of Earth's atmosphere. Known as Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO), spacecraft at these altitudes have to battle against the significantly greater drag from the air in the upper reaches of the atmosphere than their loftier cousins, lest they get pushed out of the sky. Should they manage it, however, such satellites might achieve something even more jaw-dropping \u2013 they could potentially fly forever.\n\"When you start describing it to people, it starts to sound like a perpetual motion machine,\" says Spence Wise, senior vice-president at Redwire, an aerospace firm in Florida. A perpetual motion machine is not meant to be possible. But it almost is, in this instance.\nA handful of pioneering companies have begun work on designs for satellites that may be able to orbit the planet at these unusually low altitudes while simultaneously harvesting air and using it to make propellant \u2013 literally on the fly. This new generation of orbiters could enable ultra-high-definition surveillance of activities on the ground, or superfast satellite-based communications.\nIf you want to send something into orbit, you have to decide how high your satellite is going to fly. Earth orbits are generally described in terms of altitude and are categorised into different sections. In high orbits, 22,000 miles (36,000km) above Earth, satellites enter a geostationary position, meaning they are always above the same location on Earth below. This is useful for telecommunications and weather monitoring, for example. Next is Medium Earth orbit, which spans from roughly 22,000 miles (36,000km) down to 1,200 miles (2,000km) above the planet's surface. Below this is Low Earth orbit, which stretches down to altitudes of 250 miles (400km), where the International Space Station (ISS) is found.\nEven further below this lies VLEO, loosely defined as anything below the ISS and down to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km). Operating here is difficult because of the influence of Earth's atmosphere. \"The atmosphere will increase exponentially as you come down,\" says Hugh Lewis, a professor of astronautics and a space debris expert at the University of Southampton in the UK.\nThat creates more drag on your satellite, which can spell doom. As molecules in the atmosphere smash into the satellite, they rob the vehicle of its momentum, causing the tug of our planet's gravity to drag it towards the ground.\nA satellite left in medium Earth orbit or above would carry on circling our planet for millennia. In VLEO, however, it would last barely months, weeks, or even days depending on its speed, shape and mass, dictating the amount of drag it produces and thus its lifetime. Once a satellite dips to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km), the end is imminent. The intense friction created by the thicker atmosphere subjects the satellite to temperatures of thousands of degrees, ultimately tearing it apart.\nAll satellites pass through VLEO on their way up or down, but not many have purposefully tried to stay there. One such spacecraft, however, was the European Space Agency's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. Launched in 2009, it orbited at an altitude of around 155 miles (250km), using an ion propulsion system to fire out charged particles behind the spacecraft. This gave it a constant level of thrust that could counteract the drag of the atmosphere.\nGOCE was intended to measure Earth's gravitational field with extreme precision, which it achieved. But it also demonstrated the design choices that were necessary for operating in VLEO. It had a sleek, elongated form that helped it to overcome atmospheric drag. \"It looked like a dart,\" says Lewis. GOCE ultimately ran out of fuel and burned up in the atmosphere on re-entry in 2013.\nSeveral companies are now trying to do something even more impressive. They are developing technology to harvest molecules from the thin layer of air that is present in VLEO in order to actually propel satellites here. Such a system, called Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP), has been made possible by advancements in electric and ion propulsion in recent years. In essence, it involves fixing a large bucket or opening to the front of the satellite, into which gas molecules from the atmosphere flow before they are ionised to create plasma that generates thrust.\n\"The idea is to use the same air slowing down your satellite as a propellant,\" says Francesco Romano, a scientist at the Swiss Plasma Center in Lausanne, Switzerland, who has previously studied this technology. Using electric and magnetic fields, the engine would ionise gas from the atmosphere, taking away one electron from each molecule, to produce a free electron and an ion. Then, using magnets, the electrons and ions are pushed out the back of the spacecraft, producing thrust. \"Theoretically, if you can generate a thrust that is the same as your drag, you stay at this altitude for an infinite amount of time,\" says Romano.\nTo date, an assortment of experimental ABEP systems have been able to produce relatively small amounts of thrust at ground level, but their feasibility in orbit has yet to be properly tested.\nOne company investigating the potential of ABEP is Stellar Advanced Concepts in London. Together with another\u00a0firm in the Netherlands and the University of Manchester, the company\u00a0received a grant of \u00a3390,000 ($510,000) from the British government towards their efforts in July 2024. They hope to launch a demonstration of the technology into space by 2027. \"That would be a small satellite with a small payload, maybe an Earth observation camera of some kind, as a proof of principle,\" says Newsam.\nA start-up called Kreios Space, based in Vigo, Spain, is also working on an ABEP prototype it aims to fly by 2026. In Kreios's case, this would be a small satellite \"that allows us to do all the testing in orbit in different altitudes,\" says Adri\u00e1n Senar Tejedor, the company's CEO and co-founder. The optimal altitude for thrust and drag balancing is expected to be between 125 to 155 miles (200 to 250km). \"That's the sweet spot,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nBut he points out that significant contracts for developing this technology are emerging on the other side of the Atlantic.\nThe US Department of Defense's Otter program has already committed more than $20m (\u00a316m) to help several companies develop air-breathing VLEO satellites. One of them, Redwire is designing a sleek \"orbital drone\" called SabreSat.\nRedwire's design for a satellite has solar panels facing edge-on to its motion, like the fins of a fish, in order to reduce drag on the spacecraft. The company says SabreSat would be able to spend up to seven years in VLEO. The build would be modular, so that different versions of the satellite could fly with different instruments on board. \"You can think of it like a ship,\" says Wise. \"It has bulkheads, and we're able to add additional bulkheads to increase the length.\"\nThe European arm of Redwire is concurrently developing its own VLEO satellite, called Phantom, as part of a European Space Agency (Esa) project called Skimsat. \"We're currently in the middle of the design stage, and the team is working towards a launch in 2027 or 2028,\" says Juan Pablo Ramos, business development manager for Redwire in Antwerp, Belgium.\nPhantom will not use air-breathing technology, however. Instead, it will rely on a specific blend of undisclosed materials on the satellite to reduce drag and an aerodynamic cone-shaped front. \"The cone is designed to improve drag and protect the instruments,\" says Ramos.\nGetting to orbit soon is important. \"I expect it to become increasingly popular,\" says Newsam. \"I do think it's important to have first-mover advantage. Whoever gains the credibility of being able to produce an ABEP system, they would win the orders. But there should end up being a reasonably big market.\"\nThere are some very good reasons for operating a satellite in VLEO. The first is Earth imaging \u2013 the closer you are to Earth, the higher resolution your images can be. \"You could either have smaller cameras and gain the same quality of data, or the same camera and get a higher resolution,\" adds Newsam.\nThat might be useful for the military, but also for civilian purposes too. \"There are lots of applications in maritime, agriculture, wildfire monitoring,\" says Senar Tejedor. And there could be scientific benefits from studying the atmosphere in VLEO. Putting sensors on satellites operating here \"would be a dream\", says Sean Elvidge, an assistant professor of space environment at the University of Birmingham in the UK. \"It would tell us an awful lot about the environment.\"\nThe other major application of being in VLEO is that you are closer to the ground for communications. That is particularly useful for space internet services, like SpaceX's Starlink network, which currently beams the internet to receivers on the ground from higher orbits. By using lower satellites in VLEO, the antennas can act like mobile phone towers and beam the internet straight to your phone. \"Going direct to a cell phone is a challenging task to do from space,\" says Tim Farrar, a satellite communications expert in California. \"These lower [orbits] could enable a direct-to-cell constellation.\"\nThe overall global market for VLEO satellite services could be vast. \"We expect it to be around $15bn (\u00a311.5bn) in 2032,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nAn oft-touted benefit of VLEO, aside from the various novel applications, is that this kind of orbit is self-cleaning. Generally, defunct or dead satellites in VLEO will eventually fall back into the deeper atmosphere and break up, limiting the volume of space junk that would otherwise be left orbiting Earth.\nWhile this is true, Lewis points out that debris generated in VLEO can sometimes get flung into higher orbits, posing problems for other satellites. An Indian anti-satellite missile test in VLEO in 2019, for example, sent debris up to an altitude of 870 miles (1,400km) and it remained in orbit for 18 months, says Lewis. \"If you have a collision or energetic explosion, some of those fragments can be ejected into larger orbits,\" he says. \"It's not this perfect environment.\"\nHaving lots of new satellites potentially operating in VLEO is also going to make for a complicated environment, says Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at the Secure World Foundation in Washington DC in the US. Operating in VLEO is \"not a cut and dry thing\", says Samson.\nAt such altitudes, satellites are particularly sensitive to the effects of the Sun, since heat can shrink or swell Earth's atmosphere as solar activity waxes and wanes. This caused trouble for 38 newly launched SpaceX Starlink satellites in 2022 when a geomagnetic storm caused the amount of atmospheric drag to increase by up to 50%, causing them to be pulled back towards Earth and burn up. It is a risk that will need to be carefully monitored by keeping a close eye on space weather forecasts, says Samson.\nYet there's little doubt about the rising interest in this poorly exploited region at the very edge of space. \"There is a race,\" says Senar Tejedor. And whoever can crack VLEO first will usher in a new era of space technology.\n* This article has been updated to clarify that Redwire will not achieve limitless VLEO with its SabreSat satellite under its contract with Darpa. It will be able to support a mission lifetime of up to seven years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nIt had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference.

        "headline": "'Raw hunger' to 'scandalous excess': How Led Zeppelin became Britain's ultimate 70s rock band",

        "article_text": "Becoming Led Zeppelin is a new authorised documentary that tells the \"untold story\" of the band, who despite achieving global influence and legendary status, are difficult to define.\nRock's mightiest anthems, and the tales surrounding them, tend to be continually replayed \u2013 and sometimes, their power fades over time. Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "As travellers flock to the English countryside to celebrate the renowned novelist, we asked experts to weigh in on the best Austen-themed festivals, reenactments and balls of the year.\nWith bonnets and boarding passes ready, a brigade of Jane Austen fans from around the world is preparing to bombard Britain, eager to celebrate one of English literature's greatest writers throughout 2025 on her 250th birthday.\nFrom the dashing John Willoughby in Sense and Sensibility to the spirited Emma Woodhouse in the eponymous Emma, Austen's characters have enchanted generations of readers, inspiring yearly pilgrimages to her home county of Hampshire and beyond to trace her footsteps. This year, these journeys take on a celebratory air as travellers flock to the English countryside for literary festivals, reenactments and Regency balls designed to pay tribute to the author.\nHere are the year's most ostentatious events, according to Austen experts \u2013 the ones promising fans an unforgettable birthday bash for a writer who presciently wrote, \"One cannot have too large a party.\"\nAlthough her vivid portrayals of English life now epitomise the extravagance of the Georgian era, Austen's own story began modestly. She was born on 16 December 1775, in the village of Steventon, in Hampshire, England, the seventh child and youngest daughter of clergyman George Austen and his wife Cassandra.\n\"It must have been a bustling household, with the large Austen family and the boys her father tutored,\" said Janet Todd, one of Britain's leading Austen scholars. Although the rectory where the Austens lived was demolished in 1824, St Nicholas Church, where they worshipped, still stands. A dedicated team of volunteers is working to ensure every visit to the historic chapel is memorable.\nNot at all bowing to the idea of being the country cousin to the author's more well-known former towns, like Bath and Chawton, Steventon has organised lively events for June, July and December. Visitors can attend the Jane Austen's Words and Music Chamber concert on 8 June\u00a0 at her family's chapel or join a country fair on 6 June held in the same pump field where the Austen's parsonage home once stood. Then, in remembrance, the church will hold a special Thanksgiving Service for Austen on her birthday on 16 December.\nIn Austen's England, balls were pivotal to social life and courtship among the middle and upper classes. For Zack Pinsent, a 29-year-old tailor known for exclusively wearing Regency-era attire, attending a ball is the ultimate tribute to Austen. This year's calendar is packed with options, from a Regency Week Ball in Alton this June to a Yuletide Birthday Ball in Bath come December. However, Pinsent recommends the Brighton Royal Grand Pavilion Ball on January 25, which he is organising and has already drawn attendees from 16 countries.\n\"Anyone can attend, as long as they have the right outfit,\" said Pinsent, who has secured the Royal Pavilion for the eponymous Regency-inspired event.\nBrighton's Royal Pavilion, built by George IV, Austen's contemporary and admirer, hosted extravagant balls in its heyday. Though there's no evidence Austen ever visited, Pinsent speculates she may have, given Brighton's influence on her imagination. The seaside town even earned a mention in Pride and Prejudice, when Austen wrote of Lydia Bennet: \"At Brighton, she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\"\nAusten set two of her novels, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, in Bath, but her feelings about the resort town remain debated. Her famously dramatic reaction to her family's move there from Steventon \u2013 she allegedly fainted \u2013 hints at reluctance. Still, during her years in Bath (1801-1806), its vibrant social scene, from galas at Sydney Gardens to events at the Assembly Rooms, inspired her work. However, personal tragedy, including her father's death during this time, likely influenced her perception of the city.\n\"The party line is, we don't really know how she felt about Bath,\" said Georgia Delve, director of the Jane Austen Centre Festival (held 12-21 September in Bath). \"But I think in terms of her storyline and the characters, you walk around the city, and it's all written in the stone: you get Bennett Street, you've got Bartlett Street, you've got the Assembly Rooms, you've got the Royal Crescent, you've got the Paragon, you know, great Pulteney Street. All these places come up in her letters and novels.\"\nBath's enduring love for Austen is clear, exemplified by its Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of people in Regency costumes. This year's Austen Festival begins with a grand promenade, drawing fans worldwide.\nBeyond the festival, the Jane Austen Centre is hosting two summer Regency balls, including a Persuasion-themed Nautical Ball on 31 May and a unique Sanditon-inspired event based on Austen's unfinished novel of the same name on 28 June. The event will include dance workshops to master waltzes and cotillions.\nThe port city of Southampton played a role in Austen's life on three occasions \u2013 an often-overlooked fact that the town is hoping to rectify this year. She briefly attended boarding school there, celebrated her 18th birthday at the city's historic Dolphin Hotel, and later stayed there with her brother after departing Bath. To honour the city's deep ties, Southampton plans to display her travel writing desk now through \u200b\u200b23 February at God's House Tower, on loan from the British Library as part of the exhibit In Training for a Heroine. The portable mahogany desk was a gift from her father, and on it, she wrote what she referred to as \"My own darling child,\" the first draft of Pride and Prejudice. Tickets are free, but visitors must reserve a time to see the installation.\nAccording to Todd, much of Austen's enduring appeal lies in her connection to a romanticised England. Hampshire, where she lived, wrote, and set many of her novels, preserved its charm by avoiding industrialisation. This timeless quality makes a visit to the author's former home in Chawton, now called Jane Austen's House, a uniquely transportive experience. After her father's death left Jane, her sister and their mother nearly penniless, with only \u00a3210 a year, according to Todd, Jane's brother Edward eventually moved them into his cottage in 1809. It was here, in this idyllic setting, that Jane refined her six novels.\nMore like this:\n \u2022 What Jane Austen can teach us about resilience\n \u2022 Britain's greatest natural wonders to explore in the wintertime\n \u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\nTo celebrate the writer's 250th birthday, the Jane Austen House hosts a Pride and Prejudice Festival from 23-28 January, featuring Austenmania, a year-long exhibit dedicated to her posthumous cinematic legacy. The site has also launched a permanent exhibition, Jane Austen and the Art of Writing, showcasing her creative process and first editions of her works. \"It's quite moving to be in there with them,\" said 15-year docent Janie McShane of the priceless tomes. For many visitors, that's the real allure, to see how Austen lived, \"to tread,\" McShane said, \"where she tread\".\nAusten was an enthusiastic walker. In a world where a woman's life was nearly always spent supervised or in the company of family and friends, taking a stroll likely meant freedom and escape. \"Austen's characters walk to be themselves and to change,\" writes Rachel Cohen in Austen Years: A Memoir in Five Novels. \nPat Lerew, chair of the Jane Austen Alton Group, says her village will give visitors the same opportunity. Alton is reasonably short stroll from Austen's House. \"We know Jane and her sister walked into Alton two or three times a week to shop or visit with friends,\" Lerew said. \"She would also pick up the coach here to go to London.\" Similarly, the 10-day Jane Austen Regency Week (20-29 June) will include a Regency Day with stalls and entertainment guests can peruse, followed by a ribbon cutting on a new public Jane Austen Garden.\nThe final chapter of Jane's life was tragic. At 41, she fell ill with a mysterious condition that modern experts have speculated may have been Addison's disease or Hodgkin lymphoma. Her deteriorating condition required a move from Chawton cottage to Winchester to seek specialised care. Jane and her sister Cassandra took up residence at No. 8 College Street, a property now owned by Winchester College, a historic boarding school attended by eight of Austen's nephews. This summer, for the first time ever, the school is opening the apartments to the public.\n\"The apartment remains strikingly similar to how it was in Austen's time,\" said Richard Foster, the Fellows' Librarian and Keeper of Collections at the college, who has played a key role in organising the opening. \"Austen describes a neat little drawing room with a bay window overlooking the headmaster's garden, and those features are still intact.\" It was in this space that Austen penned her final poem, and from the same bay window, Cassandra watched her sister's funeral procession \u2013 restricted by 19th-Century customs that barred women from attending.\nTickets for this limited-time opening are available online. Visitors can also honour Austen at her final resting place in the north nave of Winchester Cathedral. Her simple gravestone, devoid of any mention of her literary brilliance, seems almost ironic \u2013 a fact Austen herself might have found darkly amusing. The modest epitaph only nods to the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", a description she might have skewered with her signature wit. After all, as she once wrote, \"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nA popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: \"I don't care about Levy, he doesn't care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski.\"\nProminent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: \"Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed\" and \"24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change\".\nA crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.\nThe debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.\nFan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.\nClub sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.\nTottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.\nA 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\nLast week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.\nAmong those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.\nBBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.\nSome of the key points made were:\nLevy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structures\nHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide away\nAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially\nClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals\nSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies.\nA banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy's tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the \"most profitable club in Premier League history\" because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a \"degree of caution\" on transfer spending.\nHe describes Spurs as a \"superb cash-making machine\" who have \"outperformed any other club in England\".\nMaguire outlined:\nHis figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made \u00a3171m profit. Burnley were second on \u00a3159m, with Arsenal third on \u00a3105m\nIn the past decade, Spurs have the sixth-highest total wage bill in the Premier League (\u00a31.6bn vs Man City's \u00a32.9bn as the highest); the sixth-highest transfer spend (\u00a31.3bn vs Chelsea's \u00a32.8bn as the most); with the fifth-highest net spend over a similar period\nTottenham fans pay among the highest season ticket prices and matchday prices in the top flight\nLevy has the highest chief executive pay of Premier League clubs that declare such data. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned \u00a36.6m.\nDaniel Levy has been Tottenham's chairman since 2001\nClub insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham's progress under his leadership.\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be \"very ruthless\" but \"genuinely wants the best for Spurs\".\nThey claimed some of the \"own goals\" - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not \"surround himself with the best people\". \nThey described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as \"people too similar to him\" who will \"sit with their heads in their phones\", rather than \"people who make up for [Levy's] weaknesses\".\nThe source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: \"One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot.\"\nWhile Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".\nAnother source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".\nThey added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.\nFrom the archive: Inside Levy's 20 years at Tottenham (2021)\nPostecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy?\nIs Postecoglou's style causing Tottenham's injury crisis?\nSources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. \nThey say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table.\nWhile Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner.\nThat means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say.\nDuring the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club.\nOther sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League's highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated \u00a350m-plus over his 25 years in charge.\nThis week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs' ownership situation played it down.\nIn 2023, when Paris St-Germain's owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\nOne source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \"more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement\" - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates.\nVarious reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn.\nChelsea were bought in a deal worth up to \u00a34.25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was \u00a32.5bn with a commitment to spending \u00a31.75bn over the next 10 years.\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for \u00a31.03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to \u00a35bn for 100% of the club.\nDespite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential.\nAccording to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new \u00a31.2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was \"all-consumed\" and the board \"left everyone to do their jobs\". \nSpurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.\nThat source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.\nPaul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.\nIt could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".\nAnother source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".\nThey said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.\nHowever, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. \nOne criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.\nLevy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".\nThey are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.\nThe source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.\nThey added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.\nIt was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".\nSources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. \nThey will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation.\nTottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.\nIt is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models.\nSpurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the 'traditional top six' are either richer or bigger.\n\"We don't make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don't apologise at all,\" Levy said at September's fan forum.\n\"We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we've got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we're looking for.\"\nIn a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United's 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. \nThey believe a \"vocal minority\" of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change.\nThey added: \"Spurs haven't got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come.\"\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

His availability after a concussion at St Mirren on Monday could well be key to this game.\nThe loan signing of Belgian striker Elton Kabangu seems to have liberated Lawrence Shankland too, and the Jambos showed the sort of resilience that was sorely lacking earlier in the season when they edged past the Buddies in the Scottish Cup.\nYet, despite the cloud hanging over Clement, Rangers have won each of their past four league games - and all by a margin of at least two goals. It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.\nHistory is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.\nRangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.\nThat record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.\nThis video can not be played\nMOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'\nThird-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.\nThat said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.\nSo, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.\nCould that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?\nHe has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.\nPerhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.\nMight Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?\nIf he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?\nThis video can not be played\nHighlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline Athletic\nEvery new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.\nIt usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.\nThen Thelin pitched up. \nThe Dons had chased the Swede for a long time before landing him and it soon became clear why they had been so patient. Ten wins from their first 11 Premiership games at the start of the season and a dramatic point at Celtic led to talk of a title challenge.\nThelin had somehow turned largely the same squad that saw off Neil Warnock within eight games into one that seemed poised to push Celtic into the new year.  \nHis stock went through the roof and there was even gossip linking him with ambitious Birmingham City.\nBut if his stock rose rapidly, it has dropped even more quickly. Aberdeen have lost eight and drawn one of their past nine league games - as many defeats as in their previous 37 games.\nThey have gone from putting pressure on Celtic in second to fourth - just five points ahead of eighth. Thelin, incredibly, is under serious pressure for his job within two months of being touted as Fergie 2.0.\nHis tactics and style of play have been criticised, with suggestions other teams have now worked him out.\nThe good news for him is the Dons play Dundee next.\nAberdeen's last league win was against Dundee, three months ago, and the last time they won an away league game was against Dundee, almost five months ago.\nTony Docherty's side have conceded more goals (53) and faced a higher expected goals against total (46.1) than any other side in the Premiership this season. \nThey have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. \nOh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.\nAberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. \nHe will know that if he doesn't, he then faces exacting matches against former Dons boss Derek McInnes' new side Kilmarnock, Celtic and third-placed Dundee United.",

        "article_text": "Ordered by the Trump administration to drop a corruption case against New York's mayor, a top federal prosecutor instead resigned in protest.\nDanielle Sassoon is known as a tough but fair conservative attorney, according to former colleagues and courtroom rivals alike.\nIn 2016, Danielle Sassoon wrote a tribute to a former boss, the late US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. She praised the conservative jurist's character, and his legal approach. Such qualities were not universal, she told readers.\n\"Sometimes, when you peek behind the curtain of power, you suffer a rude awakening,\" she wrote. \"What you find is corruption, ego, or a lack of ideals and intellectual heft.\"\nOn Thursday, Sassoon, who had served just three weeks as the interim head of the Southern District of New York offered the country a peek behind that curtain of power.\nThe 38-year-old federal prosecutor resigned on Thursday, after refusing to comply with the Justice Department's order to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\nShe did not go quietly. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, which quickly became public, Sassoon said there was no legal justification for dismissing the case.\nShe made explosive allegations of a quid-pro-quo proposed by Adams' attorneys to the justice department, and said that the top official who ordered them to stop, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, had not provided sufficient legal justification for his actions.\nAdams and his attorney, Alex Spiro, have denied Sassoon's allegation. Trump himself has denied political meddling in the criminal case.\nIn her resignation letter, Sassoon wrote: \"Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations.\"\nSassoon's resignation has sparked the most public upheaval of the criminal justice system since Donald Trump took office in January. \nSix prosecutors at the justice department's criminal and public integrity unit, including its interim leaders Kevin Driscoll and John Keller, resigned as well, CBS News, BBC News' US media partner, reported. \nHagan Scotten, another federal prosecutor, wrote in his own resignation letter that he was \"entirely in agreement\" with Sassoon's decision not to drop the Adams case.\nThose who worked with Sassoon say they are not surprised she took this extraordinary stance.\nCarrie Cohen, a former colleague at the Southern District of New York, described her as \"an excellent, diligent, tough, but fair prosecutor, exactly the type of prosecutor that people should want serving their country\".\nOn Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James lauded Sassoon as a \"profile in courage\".\nEven those who worked against Sassoon's team of prosecutors in court praised her decision.\nSassoon and her team were \"fierce advocates for the office\", said criminal defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman.\n\"While I didn't always see eye to eye with them, they were fair and just,\" he said. \nIn a Fox News appearance on Friday morning, Mayor Adams called Sassoon's allegations \"silly\" and said she was accusing him of \"a crime\".\nMr Spiro called her accusations a \"lie\".\n\"We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,\" he told CBS News.\nSassoon began her legal career at Yale Law School, where she served as a features editor for the prestigious Yale Law Journal. \nIn 2013, she went to London on a Temple Bar Scholarship, where she shadowed barristers and learned the differences between the US and UK justice systems, according to an essay she wrote about her experience abroad.\nShe also served as a foreign law clerk to Justice Hanan Melcer of the Israel Supreme Court in 2009.\nSassoon won prestigious clerkships with well known conservative jurists: Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III  of the fourth circuit court of appeals, and later Scalia, perhaps the most high-profile member of the US Supreme Court at the time.\nScalia \"taught me how to fire a pistol and a rifle, and made me feel like I had grit\", Sassoon wrote in her 2016 memorial for Scotus blog. \"He thickened my skin, which was the best preparation for a career in a male-dominated field.\"\nIn her letter to the US attorney general this week, Sassoon highlighted her work for these conservatives, potentially heading off allegations that she defied the justice department for partisan reasons.\n\"Both men instilled in me a sense of duty to contribute to the public good and up hold the rule of law, and a commitment to reasoned and thorough analysis,\" she wrote to Bondi.\nSassoon joined the Southern District of New York in 2016 after stints at a white collar firm and on the faculty at New York University Law School. She is a member of the Federalist Society, a professional group of conservative lawyers and scholars.\nShe prosecuted the fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, which resulted in a guilty verdict and a sentence of 25 years in prison.\n\"There was an abundance of evidence in that case and the outcome was expected by all, but it was complex and the prosecutors were very professional, organized and cogent,\" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School who followed the case closely.\nDespite her work on such high profile cases, Sassoon kept a low profile, as is typical for federal prosecutors.\nShe was temporarily leading the Southern District of New York, while Trump's choice for the top job, Jay Clayton, awaited US Senate confirmation. \nWith her conservative bona fides, she could have potentially found work in the new Republican administration.\nBut then came Bove's instruction to drop the corruption case against Adams, who was accused of accepting bribes and improper campaign contributions from foreign nationals. \nAdams has denied the claims and pleaded not guilty. His trial was set for April.\nSassoon's decision to defy orders, and reveal secretive justice department discussions on her way out the door, was extremely unusual, Manhattan attorneys said.\n\"This is the stuff you never see,\" said Arthur Aidala, a criminal defence attorney.\nThe justice department could still take retaliatory measures. \nIn his response to Sassoon, Bove wrote that he was putting assistant US attorneys involved in the Adams case on leave pending an investigation. He also said the justice department would \"evaluate your conduct\".\nBut New York lawyers say that Sassoon's act of defiance may have sprung from necessity as much as conviction.\n\"Both from a moral perspective and a practical perspective she had no choice,\" said Mark Zauderer, a high-profile appellate attorney. \"The office would have been in shambles.\"\nTo comply with Bove could have prompted a staff exodus and put the office's reputation at risk, he said.\nMs Cohen, who still considered Sassoon a friend, said she recalled the prosecutor as a staunch advocate for her colleagues.\n\"You can see that support in her decision to put the office, and her oath of office, at the forefront of her decision to resign,\" Ms Cohen said.",

        "article_text": "He's an expert on all of NOLA's iconic foods but has a special place in his heart for gumbo. Here are his favourite bowls \u2013 from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine \u2013 unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\u00a0\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of\u00a0Acadian\u00a0descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\u00a0\nThe SpeciaList\nEmeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a\u00a0YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of\u00a0opinions on the\u00a0right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game \u2013 or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra \u2013 a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse \u2013 famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live \u00a0\u2013 has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo \u2013 served over rice \u2013 Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant, Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit\u00a0since\u00a0the space first opened in 1990. \"It used to be made with seafood,\" he says, \"then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.\"\nIt's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the\u00a0presentation\u00a0has too. \"The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,\" he says, \"that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux.\" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.\nHere are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.\nCommander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.\nPo'boys\nPo'boys (sometimes also written \"poor boy\") are one of NOLA's classic sandwiches \u2013 meats or seafood stuffed into crisp, light French bread. Lagasse's favourite? The po'boys at Domilise's. Inside the little yellow house on Annunciation Street, customers can choose from a whole menu of classic po'boys,\u00a0but Lagasse's top picks are fried shrimp, fried oysters or roast beef. \"You need about 20 napkins to eat the roast beef po-boy. It's soaked in gravy on NOLA-style French bread,\" he says. \"People debate whether to get it dressed\u00a0or not. I go for the dressed\u00a0po'boy, with\u00a0lettuce, tomato and pickles.\"\nIn the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct\u00a0blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of \"haute Creole cuisine\", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo.\u00a0\nEven though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. \"Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,\" he says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.commanderspalace.com/\nAddress: 1403 Washington Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: +1 504-899-8221\nInstagram: @commanderspalace\nCaf\u00e9 Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.\nLagasse's Insider Tips\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde\u00a0in the French Quarter is iconic but crawling with tourists; locals get their hot sugar-dusted beignets at Caf\u00e9\u00a0du Monde's other location on\u00a0Dreyfous Drive\u00a0instead.\u00a0\nAnd for Lagasse, NOLA's best fried chicken comes from\u00a0Popeye's Chicken, the international fast food chain, founded in New Orleans in 1972. \"I don't know why, it's the same formula. But I think NOLA has the best Popeye's fried chicken, no matter which one you go to.\"\u00a0\nWhile most of the hundreds of interns who have been through the 14-week programme go on to work in restaurants, others become nurses, mechanics, technicians and more. What's consistent is that they all learn to cook classic New Orleans fare like red beans and rice, po'boys and gumbo. \"Caf\u00e9 Reconcile's chicken and sausage gumbo has a rich roux with lots of okra,\" says Lagasse, \"and it always hits the spot.\" It's a win-win, according to Lagasse. \"Your meal helps support the workforce development,\" he says. \"What could be better?\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://cafereconcile.org/\nAddress: 1631 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70113\nPhone: +1 504-568-1157\nInstagram:\u00a0@cafereconcile\nKnown as the Queen of Creole cuisine, chef Leah Chase was the heart behind legendary Dooky Chase Restaurant, first opened\u00a0in 1941 by\u00a0her in-laws and later evolving into a meeting place for excellent food, music and dialogue.\nJambalaya\nWhen Lagasse craves jambalaya \u2013 a rice dish cooked with a variety of proteins \u2013 he goes to one of two places for what he defines as the best: \"one that's not too dry and not too wet.\" The first is Toups' Meatery where the jambalaya is prepared with chicken and smoky andouille sausage. He also likes the jambalaya at Dooky Chase, which includes three kinds of pork, such as smoked ham, smoked chorizo and sausage. \"In the city of New Orleans, jambalaya is primarily made in a Creole style, so you'll often find tomato in it, but out in the country there's no tomato\".\nIn the upstairs dining room, many influential leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr and the Reverend\u00a0A L Davis, met to discuss crucial issues affecting the African American community.\nStarting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday),\u00a0Chase would\u00a0cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens.\u00a0\"They do a traditional style of gumbo,\" explains Lagasse, \"but during Lent it has lots of greens \u2013 mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens\u00a0and okra, and it's finished with gumbo fil\u00e9.\"\u00a0\u00a0For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted\u00a0New Orleanians from all over the city.\u00a0Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar \"Dook\" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition. Some say it is the best in New\u00a0Orleans.\nWebsite: https://www.dookychaserestaurants.com/\nAddress: 2301 Orleans Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119\nPhone: +1 504-821-0600\nInstagram: @dookychaserestaurant\nFamily-owned since 1919, Casamento's on Magazine Street is primarily known for its briny Gulf Coast oysters, which peak during cool autumn and winter months. \"Locals love to go there whenever they see the open sign, which is only when the oysters are great,\" says Lagasse. He enjoys eating the plump oysters alongside their much-loved seafood gumbo, which is replete with shrimp, tomatoes and okra. Other Casamento's must-haves include their oyster stew and sandwiches, made with their signature \"pan bread\" instead of traditional French bread.\nWebsite: https://casamentosrestaurant.com/\nAddress: 4330 Magazine Street, New Orleans, LA 70115\nPhone: +1 504-895-9761\nInstagram: @casamentosrestaurant\nChef Frank Brigtsen also started his culinary career as an apprentice under Paul Prudhomme, who helped him and his wife Marna open\u00a0Brigtsen's\u00a0in 1986 in NOLA's Riverbend\u00a0neighbourhood, where he serves classic\u00a0Cajun-Creole cuisine.\u00a0\n\"Frank is an excellent cook,\" says Lagasse, \"and I really like his fil\u00e9 gumbo, which is Cajun-style, meaning it has no tomatoes.\" Cajun gumbo also doesn't include okra. Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with fil\u00e9 powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. \"The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,\" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour.

        "article_text": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music \u2013 with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.\nIf asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The radical trend millennials love\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forgotten Soviet genius of music\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?\nThere are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and \u2013 just as vitally \u2013 new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.\nUnsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag \"classictok\" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.\nFor French violinist Esther Abrami \u2013 who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards \u2013 the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. \"I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,\" Abrami tells BBC Culture.\nShe noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. \"I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,\" she enthuses. \"It opened this door to a completely new world.\"\nNigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fan Babatunde Akinboboye enjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. \"I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,\" he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. \"But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,\" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of \"hip-hopera\" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.\nBoth Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. \"I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,\" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts \u2013 taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery \u00a0\u2013 have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. \"It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,\" he explains. \"Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.\"\n'Complex and profound'\nAbrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: \"I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.\"\n\u00a0\nBritish concert pianist Harriet Stubbs is another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple 20-minute concerts from her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. \"I gave 250 concerts,\" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. \"I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.\"\nThe fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. \"I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,\" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a \"Bowie meets Rachmaninoff\" affair.\nInterestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia \u2013 dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery \u2013 both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub J\u00f3zef Orli\u0144ski, meanwhile, uses atmospheric visuals as a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, which The New York Times describes as \"resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos\".\n\"I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums \u2013 the narrative, the photography, the videos,\" Orli\u0144ski tells BBC Culture. \"I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,\" he adds. This is certainly something Orli\u0144ski has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, he wowed critics with his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was \"an incredible experience\" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. \"Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul \u2013 a pop song won't work.\"\nClassical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK's National Youth Orchestra have just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of \"the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager\".\nOrli\u0144ski agrees that classical music has achieved an \"almost hipstery\" status of late. \"It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,\" he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as \"people like Yuja Wang\" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. \"We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward.\" Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. \"I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,\" he concludes. \"[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing. And it'll work out, because audiences are ready.\"\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "YouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep secret.\nYouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch?\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users \u2013 almost one in three people on Earth \u2013 and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths.\nIf we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history.\nHow many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you.\nExperts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created \u2013 a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas \u2013 is operating in the dark.\nIn part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time.\nYou might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret.\nA Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue.\n\"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\"\nBut Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example.\nSo, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet.\n\"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\"\nSo, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video.\nWhen the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is.\nThe first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos.\nZuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.\nFor many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals.\nOnly 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe.\nThose with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images.\nThe top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long.\nYouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" \u2013 but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\".\nThis narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says.\n\"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\"\nYouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\"\nGoogle is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\nBut YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says.\n\"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\"\nThe most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "The painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nHe joined Manchester United at the age of seven.\nTwenty years, 426 appearances, 138 goals and five trophies later, Marcus Rashford has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nIt will seem strange to see Rashford - the boy from Wythenshawe, United through and through - wearing another team's strip.\nAs recently as November, the idea seemed fanciful.\nHow did we get here?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIn public, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim tried to counter the view that he wanted to jettison Rashford.\nBut United insiders believe the former Sporting boss felt it would be better for everyone if the forward was no longer around.\nEven towards the back end of last week, there was still hopeful talk of a resolution on Rashford's part. Now the reality is sinking in. Amorim has got his way.\nWhat has been very difficult to pinpoint, even though Amorim has given some frank interviews, is the detailed reasoning why the coach was so willing to let him leave.\nIt was all sparked when Amorim dropped Rashford for the Manchester derby on 15 December.\nThree days earlier, the forward had been substituted 11 minutes into the second half of what looked like being an embarrassing Europa League defeat by Czech side Viktoria Plzen.\nRasmus Hojlund came on to replace him and scored two goals to turn the match into a 2-1 win.\nRashford has been omitted from 11 of 12 squads since.\nThe one time he did make a squad - the 2-0 home Premier League defeat by Newcastle on 30 December - he was left on the bench. Afterwards, Amorim was asked why.\nWhen he had to address the subject again before Thursday's Europa League win over Romanian side FCSB, Amorim seemed as if he was starting to get irritated.\nThere is no doubt he has used the Rashford situation as a test of his strength. Sir Alex Ferguson, an illustrious predecessor, may well have approved.\n\"If the coach has no control, he will not last,\" Ferguson explained in a case study for Harvard Business School, published in the weeks after his retirement in 2013.\n\"You have to achieve a position of comprehensive control. Players must recognise that as the manager, you have the status to control events. Before I came to United, I told myself I wasn't going to allow anyone to be stronger than I was. Your personality has to be bigger than theirs.\"\nAmorim's latest comments on the Rashford saga were not as polished but the sentiment was the same.\n\"You [the media] want to make it personal,\" said Amorim. \"I have nothing against Marcus but I have to make the same rules for everybody.\"\nIt was more or less the same message Amorim delivered at the Etihad Stadium in dropping Rashford and forward Alejandro Garnacho for the Manchester derby win over City.\nIn various forms, it has been repeated at least half a dozen times in the interim.\n\"It's important, the performance in training, the performance in the games, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with your team-mates, the way you push your team-mates, everything is important in the context of beginning something, when we want to change a lot of things,\" Amorim outlined. \n\"It's the small details. When people in our club are losing their jobs, we have to put the standards really high.\"\nRashford scored three times in Amorim's first two league games, but hadn't been on the field for the last 12 matches\nRashford responded to that forceful assertion by using a visit to his old school to tell football writer Henry Winter he was ready for \"a new challenge\".\nThat was widely interpreted to mean the player wanted to leave. But sources close to Rashford explained that, as they understood it, he was voicing a general feeling of frustration rather than a desire to try something new.\nThey say he felt he was being eased out of a club he remained attached to - a club he felt he knew far better than those running it.\nClub sources say Rashford has trained well. Unlike Jadon Sancho, who fell out with former United boss Erik ten Hag, again over standards, Rashford was not banished to a different area of the Carrington training ground and told to change on his own.\nWhile Rashford's body language has not always presented the most positive image, recent open training showed a different side.\nDuring the 15-minute sessions broadcast before the Europa League matches against Rangers and FCSB, Rashford was expressive and light-hearted.\nWhen Amorim 'ran the gauntlet' through the first-team squad to mark his 40th birthday, Rashford was among those in the line, smiling after the United boss had charged through.\nThis video can not be played\nMarcus Rashford's best Premier League goals\nIt has never been plain sailing for Rashford at United.\nA succession of managers have felt at times they were not getting the most out of a player with blinding speed, excellent balance and an eye for goal.\nFor the 2022-23 season, the first under Ten Hag, Rashford was diligent, going to the United States for personal sessions to ensure he was ready to go when the real preparations began.\nThe reward was a career-high 30 goals. It is a strike rate no-one else in the United squad can match and is the chief reason why representatives spent time visiting some of European football's biggest clubs - Barcelona, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund - gauging interest and trying to work out what kind of a deal was possible before the transfer window closed.\nBut was the goals output confirmation of Rashford's talent or the exception amid more mediocre returns in recent times?\nThe season before, he found the net twice in his final 28 appearances. Since August 2023, he has scored 15 in total. The drop-off is alarming. Even sources close to the 27-year-old accept he is not playing well.\nHowever, despite missing the past 11 games, he is still United's joint-fourth highest scorer this season with seven, the same as \u00a372m signing Hojlund, who has played four more games.\nOnly Amad Diallo (six), Bruno Fernandes (five) and Hojlund (four) have scored more goals under Amorim than Rashford (three), who has only been on the pitch in 35% of the new head coach's games at United.\nUnited's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney has told Rashford in private he should leave. It is an observation he offered to a wider audience on The Overlap podcast.\n\"I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times,\" he said. \"I've given him my thoughts. I've said: You need to leave the football club.\n\"I went into Carrington to take my kids to game day and Marcus was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games. I remember looking at him thinking: How embarrassing is it that the parents are walking past?\"\nRooney's former United team-mate Rio Ferdinand used similar terms to describe how he would feel if a manager had called out his training performances as Amorim had to Rashford.\n\"My heart, my pride, my ego. It's embarrassment,\" Ferdinand said.\n\"For someone to question you giving 100% for the team, saying you're lacking effort and taking shortcuts: That's a damning comment. There's no way back for Marcus after that.\"\nThe mural on the side of a cafe in Withington, south Manchester, was created by a street artist in tribute after Rashford's campaign to extend free school meals during the coronavirus pandemic\nOne theory floated by a source with an understanding of the workings at Old Trafford pointed to financial matters.\nRashford and Casemiro - who has not been omitted from Amorim's squad like the England man but has played only three times since the Plzen game - are by far United's highest earners. The theory is their presence makes it difficult for United to get their profligacy in the transfer market under control.\nIf they left, representatives of prospective signings would be unable to use them as a benchmark for wage negotiations.\nConsequently, it is not until those salaries are off the books that United can properly start to move forward in a more sustainable manner, without the threat of profit and sustainability breaches hanging over them. Those rules also feed the view that homegrown stars such as Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo might need to be sold.\nUnited have grown used to subsidising moves for highly paid players who are not reaching the standards required and no longer wanted by the manager of the day. Their wage bill is one of the highest in world football. Few would say United have been getting value for money.\nAlexis Sanchez, Donny van de Beek, Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Sancho have all fallen into that bracket.\nRashford is the next one out, with United believing they have done well to negotiate a deal that, they say, covers 75% of his wages.\nSources close to the player were adamant the interest in him was huge.\nThere were offers from the Saudi Pro-League, but he felt accepting might mean abandoning his England career.\nA big ambition was to join Barcelona, but they needed to offload players to make it happen. That scenario never materialised into anything close to reality.\nSo Villa, emboldened financially by the \u00a371m sale of Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr, made their pitch.\nThere is plenty about the switch that makes sense. Villa's status is currently greater than that of United. They are pushing for a top-five slot, despite Saturday's defeat at Wolves, and have a Champions League last-16 game in March to look forward to. Unai Emery needs someone who can play through the centre, if required, or in a wide slot. Although he prefers to be on the left, Rashford can do all of this.\nEmery, it is being stressed, was a huge selling point. On a personal level, Rashford doesn't need to move house. \nSo the lifelong Manchester United fan, who felt so entwined with his team, will now wear the claret and blue of Villa, at least until the end of the season. \nAs for Amorim, he has made the big call. He no longer has to answer questions about a player who belongs to another club.\nBut he needs to deliver success himself. If he doesn't, and Rashford does well, he will be in a very uncomfortable position.",

        "article_text": "Dubai is synonymous with luxury and pampering, and Huda Beauty founder Huda Kattan knows where to find it. Here are her Dubai picks, from heavenly massages to crystal shopping.\nIn just half a century, the Emirati city of Dubai has gone from a small fishing village on the banks of the Dubai Creek to a thriving metropolis synonymous with over-the-top luxury. It's home to the Burj Khalifa \u2013 the world's tallest tower \u2013 and Deep Dive Dubai \u2013 the world's deepest pool \u2013 and it's now building the $2bn (\u00a31.64bn) mega-mall Dubai Square, the largest in the world.\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nBut even though it plays hard, Dubai doesn't forget to take care of itself; it was recently named the World's Best Spa Destination 2024 at the World Spa Awards.\nTo get to the heart of this burgeoning capital of self-care, we spoke to makeup artist-turned beauty mogul Huda Kattan, who has called Dubai home since 2008.\nThe SpeciaList\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nFor Kattan, who was born and raised in the United States but lived in the UAE for two years as a child, moving to Dubai was a homecoming. \"It's an extremely fast paced, multicultural environment,\" says Kattan, who travels endlessly around the globe for her work as the founder and CEO of Huda Beauty cosmetics. \"It's probably one of the fastest-moving [cities] I've ever seen. When I go to New York, New York is way too slow for me.\"\nKattan, whose brand headquarters is in Dubai, loves hitting the spa in her downtime. \"[It's] the best,\" she says. \"It's about going to the spas, enjoying the massages, doing the hammams, the facials. It's about investing in yourself for sure.\"\nAnd Dubai's foothold in the beauty world is also growing. Dior opened its first spa in the city in 2024 and the five-star Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab hotel with its three-storey spa will open in 2025. \"Dubai is definitely getting a lot more credibility in beauty,\" says Kattan. \"I have big celebrities asking me, 'What is happening in Dubai? What are all the treatments that people are doing?'\"\nBut self-care in Dubai isn't just about spa treatments; its glamorous shops are a strong prescription for retail therapy, while its stunning coastal panoramas refresh mind, body and soul.\nHere are Kattan's favourite ways to indulge in self-care in Dubai.\nKattan experienced her first-ever massage in Dubai 16 years ago and was instantly hooked. \"I'd never had a massage in my life until I moved here,\" she says. \"When I got my first massage, I fell asleep and was snoring and slobbering. I was like, 'What is this? This is the best experience of my life'. I now have them regularly.\"\nVisitors will find a massage to suit every budget, from designer spas to at-home mobile massages. Kattan is a fan of both, but enthuses that those looking to splurge can\u2019t go wrong with the Guerlain Spa at the One&Only The Palm hotel found on the tip of the manmade Palm Jumeriah island.\nThe Guerlain Spa features a leafy Arabic courtyard resplendent with regal fountains and a marble lobby with its own mini Guerlain boutique. Kattan was smitten from the moment she first stepped through the door. \"[It's] like a movie. It's amazing,\" she says.\nKattan usually goes for a deep tissue massage, while her husband, Portuguese businessman Christopher Goncalo, prefers the Thai massage technique. Kattan says she used to enjoy Swedish massages, but now she seeks out a sports massage treatment. \"I don't even want the relaxation anymore. I want them to work me out,\" she says. \u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.guerlain.com/ae/en-ae/guerlain-spa-one-and-only-the-palm-dubai.html \n Address: One&Only The Palm West Crescent, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai\n Phone: +971 4 440 1040\n Instagram: @guerlain/\nHammams \u2013 steam-filled public bathhouses \u2013 have been part of Middle Eastern culture as early as the 7th Century, serving not only as a place to wash off the desert sand, but a space to socialise.\nWhile modern plumbing has since been introduced, getting scrubbed clean in a room full of steam is still a hallmark of the Middle Eastern spa experience.\nTip:\n\"It's a very classy society,\" says Kattan. \"People will not look at you if you are dressed a certain way, but [they might] if you're maybe acting a little loud.\" Kattan says that she also had to take it down a notch: \"I'm American; we're very loud and I learned to adjust.\"\nKattan recommends the Talise Ottoman Spa on the West Crescent of The Palm. \"I went on my birthday. It was just the best experience,\" she says.\nThe cleansing ritual at Talise Ottoman Spa takes place in a domed marble room decorated in mosaics, where clients recline on a heated marble bed to have their skin exfoliated with a kese mitt, then revived with their choice of a honey, lavender and mint mask, or one made with purifying rose or gold.\nAfterwards, visitors can relax in one of the private majlis (cabanas) that surround a pool lit by a glittering chandelier. \"You sit there and they bring you a yogurt drink, dates and apricots,\" says Kattan. \"I was, like, I'm sure I'm in the 1600s and I'm a princess.\"\nWebsite: https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/dubai/jumeirah-zabeel-saray/wellbeing/signature-talise-ottoman-spa\n Address: Jumeirah Zabeel Saray, West Crescent, The Palm Jumeirah, Dubai \n Phone: +971 4 453 0455\n Instagram: @jumeirah \nTo truly indulge her senses, Kattan loves visiting fragrance stores.\nBedouins have been crafting seductive fragrances like heady oud from resinous woods or earthy frankincense from the gum of the Boswellia tree for centuries. \"Abdul\u00a0Samad Al Qurashi is I think the most luxurious, and they do really beautiful fragrances,\" says Kattan of the historic Saudi Arabian fragrance house, known for crafting fine fragrances since 1852. \"And Ajmal has a really beautiful store in Dubai Mall. There's also Hind Al\u00a0Oud. [Fragrance is] a big part of the culture.\"\nBut Kattan says visitors don\u2019t always need to splurge on expensive scents; they can seek out lesser-known brands: \"You can go to the souqs and buy little ones,\" she says. \"They're not necessarily ones you want to wear on a daily basis, but [the bottles are] cute trinkets. I would go to the souqs and buy the oils [and] ouds, and have [those] on my dresser.\"\nEmiratis enjoy layering their fragrance, starting with a base of oil on the pulse points, then spritzing fragrance all over the body and, finally, capturing the scent of bakhoor incense made from wood chips soaked in fragrant oils. \"They put their abaya (robe) on [the bakhoor]. Sometimes their hair will just take a little bit of smoke and it's quite beautiful,\" says Kattan. \"I've experienced it. It's amazing.\"\nWebsite: https://en-ae.ajmal.com/ \n Address: Ajmal Perfume, first floor, Dubai Mall\n Phone: +971-4-457-4111\n Instagram: @ajmalperfumes\nDubai has a global reputation as a go-to destination for luxury jewellery at tax-free prices, but when Kattan craves something sparkly, she splurges on decorative crystals.\n\"I have crystals everywhere. I'm a big crystal person,\" says Kattan, who loves placing them on windowsills and in bowls around her home in Dubai. Of the numerous glitzy crystal boutiques scattered throughout town, Kattan has a favourite: \"There's one crystal store called OOAKSTONES (One Of A Kind stones).\"\nLocated in Dubai's Alserkal Avenue arts district,\u00a0OOAKSTONES offers a highly curated selection of crystals, ranging from artisanal jewellery and statement pieces to home decor.\nKattan notes that in Dubai, crystals often cost around one-tenth the price one might spend elsewhere, and she believes visitors should make time for crystal shopping in their schedule. \"It's overwhelming and it's amazing and if you're coming to the Middle East [it's definitely something] you should do,\" says Kattan.\nWebsite: https://ooakstones.com/ \n Address: Warehouse 20 (Inside Kave), Alserkal Avenue, Dubai\n Phone: +971 52 481 6700\n Instagram: @ooakstones\nFrom dive-in cinemas and air-conditioned cabanas to loungers emblazoned with fashion brands, Dubai's beach clubs are an unabashedly glamorous affair.\nTip:\nDuring November and December, the desert temperature drops to a cool 25C. This Mediterranean-style weather can attract the crowds, so Kattan suggests choosing a hotel wisely during the high season. \"You're going to need to find a hotel in a really good location,\" says Kattan. \"I would not recommend The Palm [during peak months]. Getting in and out of it is a nightmare. I would recommend something more central.\" Kattan says that October and March are still great options for cooler months, but if you still want to go during peak season, Kattan jokes: \"Go to a hotel where you don't need to leave.\"\nKattan's go-to beach experience is SAL on the terrace of the seven-star Burj Al Arab Hotel, overlooking the Persian Gulf. \"It has a beautiful and calm setting with an amazing view.

        "article_text": "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nKendrick Lamar's most famous lyric was the heard around the world at last weekend's Super Bowl.\nAn estimated 127 million viewers saw the rapper flash a devious smile to the camera as he delivered the line - a withering takedown of bitter rival Drake.\nTaken from Grammy-winning track Not Like Us, it refers to accusations that the Canadian star had relationships with underage women - something he's denied.\nBut as 70,000 fans inside New Orlean's Caesars Superdome belted it out with him, it felt like Kendrick's winning play in the pair's long-running beef. \nIt's been public, personal and petty, but Kendrick has implied that he's waging a much wider war. \nNot just against Drake, but against what he represents.\n\"Drake is the face of the hip-hop scene as it is,\" says Margs, a London rapper who hosts rap battles on his channel Pen Game. \nThe Canadian is a huge commercial success - the most streamed artist of the 2010s, 143 million Instagram followers and a fixture on party playlists and nightclub set lists.\nHis style is melodic and accessible. He sings. \nIn other words, he's as much a pop star as he is a rapper. And where Drake goes, others follow.\n\"A lot of people see him as being responsible for the watering down of the product,\" says Margs.\n\"There's people that like the commercial side of music that just want to dance and enjoy themselves and it have no substance to it. \n\"And then there's the other side which is deep-rooted in the hip-hop culture.\"\nIt's a culture Kendrick wants to defend and celebrate.\nSpeaking before the Super Bowl show, he said the \"grit\" had gone from the genre. \n\"When people talk about rap, the conversations I'm hearing, they think it's just rapping, it's not an actual art form,\" he said.\nKendrick also took issue with rap being \"minimised to a catchy song or verse\", and said his feud with Drake actually came \"more from a space of more people putting rap to the back\".\n\"You didn't see that grit, you didn't see that bite any more. So I always took that into consideration with my music,\" he said.\nNot everyone agrees that a more mainstream-friendly version of rap makes Drake less credible.\nHis one-time rival Common recently defended him against the \"pop star\" label - saying that \"he's still an MC\" even though his songs are popular.\nKendrick, though, is passionate about rap as an artform, and said the success of Not Like Us and being chosen as the first solo hip-hop artist to front the halftime show \"meant everything\".\n\"To represent it on this type of stage is just everything that I've worked for and everything I believe in for the culture, I live and die by it,\" he said.\nHip-hop, a genre which has been around for 50 years, has a long history of protest.\nMargs says \"a lot of that has been lost\" when comparing current trends with the genre's origins.\n\"They cared about the message and what it stands for because hip-hop was something that was heavily politicised,\" he says.\n\"People used to use their voices in hip-hop to protest and get their messages out.\"\nThe political messaging in Kendrick's halftime show came from the start when actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as US government icon Uncle Sam, introduced the rapper.\nFrom there, it included references to the black power movement, imagery of a divided United States and, just before the finale, the line: \"This is bigger than the music.\"\nIt's a time of political change in the US following the re-election of Donald Trump, who was at the Super Bowl.\n\"There's no better time for people to stand on business and talk about things that matter,\" Margs says. \nKendrick - and his beef with Drake - also hark back to the origins of hip-hop in another way. \nHe's said he sees rap as a sport - and battle raps were his inspiration for the back-and-forth with Drake.\nThese face-offs - as seen in the Eminem film 8Mile - are where artists compete live, swapping disses and trying to spit the best bars to take home the prize.\nIt's rap in its purest form - substance over style and a focus on lyricism.\nKendrick said it's always been that way for him, and it's a vital part of finding the \"grit\" and \"bite\" he feels is missing.\n\"I still watch battle raps, this has always been the core definition of who I am and it's been this way since day one,\" he said.\nMargs thinks Kendrick's success will shine a light on battle rap, but he acknowledges emerging rappers are now finding new ways to cut their teeth. \nAmong them is Layyah, who was the first female rapper to win The Rap Game UK.\nShe's Team Kendrick, but doesn't plan on following his example on battle rap. \nLayyah says rap artists she looks up to like Central Cee are \"definitely not battle rappers\" but have found success and respect through other routes. \n\"We have so many platforms,\" she says. \"It's more like who can make a great song and then who can make the best routine to it.\n\"If that goes viral then it's a great song, you don't really have to do the battle raps.\"\nMargs thinks that's \"taken away from the art form a little bit\".\n\"You can win a battle on social media just through popularity or being funny... whereas with battle rap it's all about your lyrics and your skill.\"\nAs for Kendrick's beef with Drake, it's stayed quiet since Not Like Us was released last summer.\nSome people took the \"Game Over\" at the end of Kendrick's Super Bowl set as the end of the battle, and Drake's just released Gimme a Hug.\nIn that he suggests he wants to put the beef behind him and \"get the party lit\".\nBut there's still an ongoing legal case over Not Like Us - with the potential of a bitter courtroom face-off.\nMargs says that's a big contrast to settling scores on the battle rap stage. \n\"There's a sportsmanship to it but never spills over into more than that,\" says Margs.\n\"After the fight, they always hug it out and show respect for their competitor.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Food is life for this meal-obsessed island, especially when you're feeling poorly \u2013 including a spicy soup that soothes flu symptoms and a beloved chocolate drink that brings comfort.\nA few years ago, my girlfriend and I landed in Singapore after a winter holiday in Europe. Coughing, dizzy, our throats rusty and inflamed, we were far from well. But help was at hand. My (future) Singaporean mother-in-law came to the rescue, stocking our fridge with liquid medicine: congee. We spooned the thick, savoury rice porridge down our throats, feeling a little better with every swallow.\u00a0\nWarm and filling but gentle on the stomach, in good times congee is a power dinner in and of itself, and endlessly remixable. You can top it with a runny egg, chopped chives and coriander or neon splashes of garlic-chilli oil, and eat like a king. Or when sick, you can cut the tempting add-ons to a bare minimum and still be left with the soothing starch and heat. No wonder congee and its cousins are a key flu go-to in Singapore, Malaysia, China, South Korea \u2013 almost any place in East Asia where rice is a staple.\nSo strong is this porridge's connection to illness that some people can only stomach it when they're under the weather. Like Yuri Cath, a Japanese Indonesian who recently became a Singaporean citizen. \"I had a negative association with congee for the longest time because I only had it when I was sick,\" she says, echoing a sentiment of many locals. \"So, having it kind of made me feel ill.\" Not for long though, she laughs \u2013 the flavours won her over again, \"and I love congee now\".\nIt's tempting to call congee the king of flu food, but this is Singapore, one of the\u00a0most culinary-obsessed nations on Earth, and competition is fierce. A literal melting pot, the island's official languages are English, Tamil, Malay and Mandarin, representing the many cultures that form its core population. Each brings with it enough comfort dishes to soothe an army.\nWhere to eat yourself well in Singapore\nCongee:\u00a0Variety is the name of the game at\u00a0Mui Kee Congee, where your porridge can come loaded with sliced pork, beef, fish balls or abalone, to name just a few options.\n\nRasam:\u00a0Banana Leaf Apolo\u00a0boasts several locations, including one in the heart of Singapore's Little India. Their menu is extensive, but leave room for this stomach-settling dish.\nTamarind:\u00a0Looking for a food souvenir? Visit\u00a0DriedFoodSG, a multi-generation business brimming with dried goods, including tamarind paste or slices, which can be added to stews for an unmistakable flavour boost.\nBak kut teh:\u00a0Multiple businesses fight for the claim of best bak kut teh on bustling Balestier Road, including\u00a0Kai Juan Eating House\u00a0and the aptly named\u00a0Balestier Bak Kut Teh. The latter is open 24 hours a day.\nMilo:\u00a0Head to\u00a0Toast Box, a local cafe chain with more than 80 outlets famed as a popular pre-work breakfast spot. Order Milo hot or cold with kaya toast (bread with sweet coconut spread) on the side. A sugary but comforting pick-me-up.\nHippocrates would have liked this nation of six million hungry souls. The Ancient Greek thinker and physician, who once said, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,\" could witness his words come alive as a daily habit in Singapore's restaurants, homes and 120\u00a0hawker centres\u00a0boasting 6,000 stalls. Below are just some of the health-giving dishes and ingredients Hippocrates would approve of.\nSingaporean Syazana Izzati has vivid memories of her mother taking care of her when she was a child. Not with prescription pills, but with a long-held Malay practice that uses food as medicine.\n\"Whenever my siblings and I were running a fever, she used to do this thing where she'd wet our foreheads and hair,\" Izzati recalls. \"As we were lying down on bed, with a towel placed on our brow, she'd wet it with tamarind water.\" Why tamarind, or\u00a0asam\u00a0as it's known in Malay? \"Because it has cooling effects,\" she explains, \"and lowers the body temperature.\"\nTraditional Malay Medicine, like many ancient healing methods across Asia, leans deeply on jamu, or herbal and plant-based treatments like Izzati's fever poultice. \"These days, I just rely on painkillers,\" she laughs. But that may change, she says. Should she have children, she'll turn to tamarind on their feverish days \u2013 just like her mother and grandmother before her.\nBut tamarind is too popular to be used as a poultice alone. Some ingredients are so revered they crop up in other healing dishes, from cultures thousands of miles away.\nSome 5% of Singapore's population is made up of people with Indian Tamil heritage, who regularly turn to one of the tastiest flu cures you can fit in a bowl. Colourful but light, rasam, a broth originating in South India, is more than the sum of its parts. Its base consists of spices like pepper, turmeric and cumin along with garlic, onions and tomatoes \u2013 and, yes, tamarind again, in this case acting as a souring agent that gives the broth its addictive tart flavour. As a paper by two Indian medical researchers notes, rasam's ingredients are so therapeutic that the dish constitutes a \"functional food\", whose ingredients provide benefits above and beyond their nutritional value.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda\u00a0noted\u00a0when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation. Troubled by his ailing son's health and waning appetite, an ancient king of Madurai in Tamil Nadu province offered a reward for anyone who could make his child eat. One enterprising chef presented a humble bowl of rasam, which was promptly slurped up by the patient. Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda noted when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation. Troubled by his ailing son's health and waning appetite, an ancient king of Madurai in Tamil Nadu province offered a reward for anyone who could make his child eat. One enterprising chef presented a humble bowl of rasam, which was promptly slurped up by the patient. Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nToday it remains a popular pick-me-up from the flu and is prized particularly for its decongestant properties. Bak kut teh is often eaten late at night, when the day is cooler. That's because it's considered a \"heaty\" soup in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) due to its herbal make-up. The spectrum of internal \"heatiness\" and \"cooling\" are core concepts within TCM, a popular practice in Singapore. Excessive heatiness, for example, may see the body erupt in a fever, sore throat and irritability, while the inverse can lead to paleness and fatigue. The key is to balance your warm yang energy with yin, its cooler counterpart.\nAce Tan, head chef at the newly opened fine-dining restaurant ASU, is a strong believer in this balance. His childhood was steeped in the ancient health system: Ace would often visit TCM stores run by his aunts and uncles. It spurred a passion in him to understand what ingredients affected the body, and how. \"The practice of consuming specific ingredients during each season is deeply rooted in the Asian philosophy of the five elements,\" Ace says: \"wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements are intricately connected to our body systems. By consuming certain ingredients, we nourish specific body parts, ensuring a continuous cycle of cultivation and overall well-being.\"\nSo how does Ace cool himself down when balance is disrupted? \"I do have a strong affiliation\u00a0towards\u00a0two drinks in particular,\" he says, both commonly drunk as teas: \"chrysanthemum and barley, as they help mitigate the heat of my body system, preventing sore throats and fever.\"\nSometimes, however, you just need comfort above all. That's where Milo comes in, a chocolate drink sold in practically every hawker centre in town. The brand is so beloved that a paper at the National University of Singapore Centre for Governance and Sustainability dryly noted: \"It has even humorously been suggested that Milo flows through the veins of Singaporeans.\"\nThey're not wrong. During the Covid-19 pandemic, ad-hoc medical centres gave thousands of patients a care package with critical necessities such as toothpaste, crackers \u2013 and sachets of Milo powder.\nThough it originated in Australia in the 1930s, Milo became popular in many British colonies in Asia, including Singapore. In a 2019 lecture at the National Museum of Singapore, historian Dr Geoffrey Pakiam explained how, once the island achieved independence in the mid-1960s (first from Britain, and then from the Federation of Malaysia, which it briefly joined), Milo was marketed \"as a national drink\". In 1984, Milo began to be manufactured locally as well, further cementing a homegrown connection with the beverage.\nWhat makes this best-selling drink such a treat for the poorly? In part, it's because Milo is an embedded part of childhood, served at school canteens, birthday parties and picnics. That connection continues as people age or join mandatory National Service (NS). Loong Lim, who served his NS decades ago, shares that \"for a lot of guys, Milo will still bring back memories of the night snack you get in the army, when training ends late.\" Drunk by young Singaporeans drenched in sweat and mud, Milo has revived many a tired soldier, who will likely serve it to their child one day should illness strike. Followed, perhaps, by a soothing bowl of congee.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Hamas has released the names of three hostages due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, after days of fears over the future of the ceasefire.\nThey are Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, Argentine-Israeli Yair Horn, and US-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen.\nIsrael has said it will resume bombing if the three are not released on time. The warning came after Hamas said it was postponing the releases in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire. \nPresident Trump said the ceasefire should be scrapped if Hamas did not release all the hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday.\nSince the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 766 prisoners.\nDuring the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages should be freed in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel.\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.\nMore than 48,230 people have been killed by the Israel offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThere are 73 hostages taken on 7 October who are still being held in Gaza. There are also three other Israeli hostages - one of whom is dead - who have been held in Gaza for a decade or more.\nAlexander Troufanov, 29, Yair Horn, 46, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, were all seized from Kibbutz Nir Oz on the edge of Gaza.\nThe ceasefire has been under strain since it began, with each side taking reciprocal action over alleged violations. Intense efforts by mediators US, Egypt and Qatar have managed to stop it from collapsing.\nIsrael has been especially infuriated by the staged way hostages have been released - publicly displayed on platforms alongside gunmen and in front of crowds of spectators, before being handed over to the Red Cross in chaotic scenes.\nFor its part, Hamas has accused Israel of preventing what the group says are the amount of tents and aid lorries required to be let into Gaza under the terms of the ceasefire. Israel denies this.\nMeanwhile the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published video of what it said was a rocket fired at Israel from Gaza on Thursday. It said the rocket failed and landed inside Gaza.

        "article_text": "The \"very slow-burn\" new series of the satire about a luxury resort is uneven and disappointing.\nLook closely at the opening credit sequence of this season's White Lotus, set at a luxury resort on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand. The camera roves over colourful drawings depicting centuries-old scenes of the landscape and culture, but soon the images of Buddhist shrines and elephants amidst flowered greenery give way to angry monkeys and shipwrecked men being eaten by sea creatures.\nThat ominous pattern reflects the plots of every season of The White Lotus. But unlike the credit sequence and the previous two instalments, the rest of this very slow-burn season doesn't get to the danger nearly fast or vividly enough. A series should never move so slowly that it only begins to take off halfway through. The White Lotus still has writer and director Mike White's fingerprints, and occasionally his iconoclasm and inventiveness. But this uneven iteration feels flabby and elongated, with far less satiric bite.\nAs before, this season starts with an unidentified corpse, after gunshots interrupt a meditation session with the resort's so-called \"health mentor\". So much for the Eastern spiritual calm some of the rich Western travellers might have hoped for. The story then flashes back a week as the guests arrive.\nThe show always skewers the ultrarich while heading toward the murder, so it makes sense that the most intriguing characters are a wealthy financial advisor and his family, even though the jabs at their privilege are toothless. Tim Ratliff finds himself in serious, predictable business trouble back home, but Jason Isaacs makes the character's desperation visceral and urgent. His wife, Victoria (Parker Posey), is a one-note character always zonked out on anti-anxiety drugs.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Instagram wellness guru who faked cancer\n\u2022\u00a011 of the best TV shows to watch this February\n\u2022\u00a0In an age of distrust spy thrillers are booming\nWhite's astute casting often makes the season better than the story suggests, though, and the Ratliff children are especially well played. The middle child, earnest Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), has led the family to Thailand so she can research her college thesis on Buddhism, one of the few plot points that actually has to do with Thailand. The oldest son, Saxon, is a good-looking, sex-obsessed dolt. Patrick Schwarzenegger effectively channels the layers of this bro-guy whose hedonism comes back to bite him. Sam Nivola plays the youngest child, shy high-school senior Lochlan. If you get the unsettling sense that the sexual boundaries in this family are a little too loose, trust your instincts. White provides a twist that is both ick and proof that he hasn't entirely lost his edge or willingness to plumb some dark psychology. The Ratliff brothers' casting might seem to cry nepo-baby because Patrick is Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver's son, and Nivola's parents are Alessandro Nivola and Emily Mortimer. But both are entirely natural and convincing, worth casting on their own.\nIn another smart, unexpected choice, Walton Goggins from Fallout plays the enigmatic Rick, whose garish shirts and unkempt appearance make him out of place at the resort. He seems to be some kind of grifter with a younger, put-upon girlfriend (Aimee Lou Wood). But for once Goggins is not asked to grin wildly, and becomes poignant when Rick's ulterior motive is revealed \u2013 if you believe his story.\nAnd Natasha Rothwell returns as Belinda, the spa manager in Maui in the first season, now in Thailand for job training in wellness. Rothwell has always made the character touching, with a sweet diffident smile that signals how little she expects from life. Here she is used mostly as a plot device, but it's a clever plot full of call-backs to earlier seasons and too spoilery to detail.\u00a0\nBy far the weakest storyline involves three long-time friends on a girls' trip. Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb's roles are shockingly cliched, including jealousy, gossip and a holiday fling with the help. Near the start, Coon gulps a whole glass of wine, typical of the mugging and telegraphing of characters in a thread that is meant to be the most comic but just seems stale.\u00a0\nWith so many possibilities, it's disappointing that the show doesn't use its setting well. It just cuts away to a shot of a monkey or a statue of a monkey now and then. And although the premise is full of built-in cultural and class differences, the Thai characters are marginal and shallow. Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink, plays Mook, a member of the wellness staff who has little to do except smile and flirt with the security guard at the resort's entrance.\nSome major themes come to the fore as the eight-episode season winds down, especially when Piper visits a Buddhist monastery. But by the end of episode six, the last one sent to critics, the season is still just an echo of the previous ones. A fourth season has already been ordered, so The White Lotus has a chance to right itself, but maybe not in Thailand.\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Then he started kitting his house out with alarms made out of bits of paper and wires. \nBy the time he was in primary school, he had coded timetable games and was selling them back to his teachers in Twickenham, west London.\nThe schoolboy later joined Hack Club, a global hackers' community for teenagers, where he became their youngest employee at age 13.\nNow at 16, Toby has secured a $1m deal with Silicon Valley investors for an AI platform he has built, Beem.\nToby has postponed taking his GCSEs and instead is jetting off to build up his business in sunny California.\nHe said: \"This amount of money is going to be so helpful. I actually got the phone call on my birthday, so it was a great birthday gift.\n\"My friends were quite shocked by it.

        "article_text": "Jeremy Sewall has cooked at eateries around the world, but home in Boston, he's known for his clam chowder. Here are his top local bowls, from Neptune Oyster to Yankee Lobster.\nNew England Clam chowder \u2013 a stick-to-your-ribs cream-based clam and potato stew \u2013 is beloved all over the United States, but synonymous with the city of Boston.\nClear broth-style chowders or stews made by the New England region's Indigenous peoples date back hundreds of years, including tribes in what is now Massachusetts. Quahogs, a type of local clam, along with other shellfish, fish and native ingredients like corn and beans were primary ingredients in early-recorded renditions of the chowder, which later incorporated traditions brought by English settlers, who swapped corn and beans for potatoes. And since 1836, chowder \u2013 or chowdah, as it's often pronounced in Boston \u2013 has been proudly served at the city's Union Oyster House, the oldest restaurant in continuous service in the US. Over the decades, New England-style clam chowder has become woven into the very fabric of the city's culinary identity.\nThough Boston's food scene has become world-class and international, clam chowder is still found on menus all over town, from the city's finest eateries to the concession stands at Fenway Park, the iconic Red Sox ballpark. But not all creamy clam chowders are made equal. To highlight Boston's most extraordinary bowls, we spoke to Jeremy Sewall, chef and partner of Row 34 in Boston's atmospheric Seaport.\nThe SpeciaList\nNationally recognised chef Jeremy Sewall helmed kitchens around the world before opening New England seafood restaurant Row 34 in Boston. Today, the restaurant has four locations throughout the region, with a second Boston location planned later in 2025. Sewall has co-written a trio of lauded seafood cookbooks and has appeared on numerous cooking television shows, including Top Chef and Beat Bobby Flay.\nWhile the hallmarks of traditional New England clam chowder are sacrosanct \u2013 a milky-white creamy base, chopped clams, diced potatoes and often bacon or salt pork \u2013 opinions vary on other elements and ingredients. Sewall himself thickens Row 34's chowder with a traditional roux of flour and butter, adding salty bacon fat to deliver a velvety taste. His secret ingredient is a subtle dash of green tabasco. \"It adds a nice little bit of spice and acidity to it,\" he says. \"[Chowder's] been a part of Boston culture for a long time and represents what New England is. It's a hearty, simple dish that, when done really well, is an iconic thing. That's why it's been around for hundreds of years and is still one of the most popular dishes in Boston.\"\nSewall adds that Boston's location on Massachusetts Bay, and by extension, the Atlantic Ocean, intrinsically lends itself to phenomenal just-caught seafood. \"It's accessible here,\" he says. \"It's just part of how we make things; certainly a simple thing like chowder. The chopped clams that everybody traditionally uses for chowder, they're all available, so it's just how we cook here.\"\nHere are Sewall's favourite clam chowders in Boston.\nSummer Shack is a laidback restaurant in Boston's affluent Back Bay neighbourhood, just three blocks from the world-famous Boston Marathon finish line. This renowned spot is a casual outpost founded by the late Jasper White, an iconic chef best known as a pioneer in Boston fine dining. Summer Shack's menu promises a \"classic New England clam chowder\", and delivers a medium-thick, clam-packed creation. \"I think they're really good about not letting it get too thick. Some places do a really thick chowder, which I don't love,\" says Sewall. \"Summer Shack's is classic. It's oyster crackers and bacon and chopped clams and potatoes; that's exactly what I wanted today.\"\nMost Boston restaurants serve their chowder alongside packs of Westminster Backer's Co oyster crackers \u2013 flaky, dime-size crackers that diners can add in at their discretion. But Summer Shack takes the liberty of serving their chowder with oyster crackers already on top. \"Any chowder has to have some good pieces of stuff in there because it adds that texture,\" says Sewall. \"It can't be all pur\u00e9ed. You've got to feel like you're seeing stuff on your spoon and chewing things. Anything that's too creamy or too pur\u00e9ed? No. Doesn't work.\"\nWebsite: www.summershackrestaurant.com/location/summer-shack-boston\nAddress: 50 Dalton Street, Boston, MA 02115\nPhone: +1 617-867-9955\nInstagram: @jwsummershack\n\"Little Whale's is another great version of a classic clam chowder; very straight forward,\" says Sewall, crediting the restaurant's chef Michael Serpa. \"He does fresh clam, potato, bacon, celery and a little bit of fresh herbs in there. That's what chowder is supposed to be.\"\nInsider Tip\nBoston is the quintessential four-season city \u2013 cold winters, hot summers, a mild spring and a crisp autumn that Sewall believes stands out as the best time to visit. The cool air relieves the summer heat, he says, and Boston's many tree-lined streets transform into a cacophony of colour thanks to unbelievable autumn foliage. \"A New England fall is hard to beat,\" says Sewall. \"Things quiet down a bit compared to that frantic summer feel.\"\nThough chef Serpa is otherwise known for creative takes on seafood classics, cherrystone clams are the cornerstone of Little Whale's chowder. These meaty but lean palm-sized hard-shelled clams are well-suited for chowder as they are sweet and mild, their briny tenderness emphasised by the creamy broth. Though native to the US's East Coast, many chefs in the US gravitate to cherrystones harvested from New England's cool waters. Serpa's menu specifies that their rendition of chowder includes smoked bacon and thyme, flavours that impart a subtle smoky punch and dash of earthiness.\nNestled in a 19th-Century brownstone, Little Whale is a petite, charming eatery on tony Newbury Street in Back Bay. A banquette lines the wall, but the marble-top bar is one of the best spots to belly up for a chowder bowl, unless it's warm out, when the patio reigns supreme.\nWebsite: www.littlewhaleboston.com\nAddress: 314 Newbury Street, Boston, MA 02115\nPhone: +1 857-277-0800\nInstagram: @littlewhaleoysterbar\nWith cosy marble tables for two and a robust wine list full of celebratory bubbly, this tiny 37-seat temple to briny aphrodisiacs oozes romance.\nNeptune Oyster, modelled after classic Parisian oyster bars, has been a staple in Boston's predominately Italian North End neighbourhood \u2013 an iconic culinary hub \u2013 for more than two decades. A queue promising an hour-long wait is common outside this shoebox-sized restaurant, which swells with accolades from sources like The New York Times and the James Beard Foundation.\n\"Neptune does an awesome job,\" says Sewall. \"It's a classic oyster bar and they've done chowder in Boston for many, many years. It's consistent, and that can be hard to do.\"\nNeptune's Wellfleet clam chowder, named after the coastal community on nearby Cape Cod where the clams are sourced, is the most brothy on Sewall's list compared to thicker renditions, but it offers hearty chunks of fresh clams and tender potatoes that stop just short of mushy and a savouriness derived from salt-cured pork belly. Topped with thyme and a sprinkle of paprika, Neptune Oyster's chowder is perfectly suitable on its own or as an idyllic prelude to the restaurant's iconic lobster roll.\nWebsite: www.neptuneoyster.com\nAddress: 63 Salem Street #1, Boston, MA 02113\nPhone: +1 617-742-3474\nInstagram: @neptuneoyster\n\"James Hook does a really good chowder,\" says Sewall. A family-owned lobster restaurant and Boston mainstay since 1925, James Hook earned its enviable reputation in the lobster business, catching the crustaceans in Maine and Canada then hauling the lot down to Boston for distribution. Today, the restaurant ships more than 50,000lb of lobster daily across the US, while their simple counter-service seafood shanty is just steps from Boston Harbor.\nJames Hook's menu boasts New England clam \"chowda\" with a consistency that is thick, but not enough to distract from the flavour of the sweet whole clams, punctuated by hearty thick-cut potatoes. It's twice been crowned champion of Boston's annual Chowderfest, a summertime competition of the best chowders in the region.\nWebsite: https://www.jameshooklobster.com\nAddress: 440 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02110\nPhone: +1 617-423-5501\nInstagram: @jameshooklobster\nA Boston favourite since 1950, Yankee Lobster is run by the third generation of the Zanti family, who have made their living on the water. The restaurant is decidedly casual \u2013 diners order at a counter and are given a buoy with a number letting servers know where to deliver their grub. Yankee Lobster doubles as a seafood market, and its location in Boston's swanky Seaport lures locals and visitors alike.\nThe legendary \"spoon test\" for New England clam chowder is performed by inserting a spoon in the centre of the chowder to see if the consistency is thick enough to make the spoon stand straight up. Though Sewall says he personally prefers chowder not quite thick enough to pass the spoon test, he is a fan of Yankee Lobster's chowder. \"It's traditional, it's creamy, it's hot and it's rich \u2013 all the stuff it should be,\" he says. \"They do a great job.\"\nWebsite: https://www.yankeelobster.com\nAddress: 300 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA 02210\nPhone: +1 617-423-5501\nInstagram: @yankeelobsterco\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by Soviet troops on 27 January 1945. Anita Lasker, a Jewish teenager, managed to survive there simply because the camp orchestra needed a cello player.\nNow aged 99, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch is the last remaining survivor of the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz. At the age of 19, she was interviewed by the BBC on 15 April 1945, the day of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen death camp where she had been transferred six months earlier. Interviewed in German, the language she grew up speaking, she said: \"First, I would like to say a few words about Auschwitz. The few who have survived are afraid that the world will not believe what happened there.\"\nWarning: This article contains graphic details of the Holocaust \n\nShe continued: \"A doctor and a commander stood on the ramp when the transports arrived, and sorting was done right before our eyes. This means they asked for the age and health condition of the new arrivals. The unsuspecting newcomers tended to report any ailments, thereby signing their death sentences. They particularly targeted children and the elderly. Right, left, right, left. To the right was life; to the left, the chimney.\"\nWhen she first arrived at the Auschwitz unloading platform known as the ramp, her casual comment that she played the cello was enough to change the direction of her life. \"Music was played to accompany the most terrible things,\" she said.\nThe then Anita Lasker barely spoke German in public again for 50 years after World War Two, but when she was growing up, her hometown of Breslau was part of Germany. Now known as Wroc\u0142aw, it has been part of Poland since the end of the war. Lasker's mother Edith was a talented violinist and her father Alfons was a successful lawyer. As the youngest of three daughters, she grew up in a happy home where music and other cultural pursuits were encouraged. She knew at an early age that she wanted to be a cellist, but outside the sanctuary of her family home, darker forces were stirring.\nShe recalled on a BBC television documentary in 1996: \"We were the typical assimilated German-Jewish family. We went to a little private school, and I suddenly heard, 'Don't give the Jew the sponge,' and I thought, 'What is all this?'\"\u00a0\nBy 1938, as antisemitism took hold in Nazi Germany, Lasker's parents couldn't find a cello tutor in Breslau who would teach a Jewish child. She was sent to Berlin to study, but had to rush back to her parents after a night of murder and mayhem. On 9 November 1938, the insidious persecution of Jewish people turned violent as Nazis smashed the windows of homes, businesses and synagogues on Kristallnacht\u00a0or \"the night of broken glass\".\u00a0\nBack at home, Lasker's parents continued to instil a love of culture in their children, as \"nobody can take that away from us\". Her eldest sister Marianne escaped in 1939 on the Kindertransport, the mission which took thousands of children to safety in Britain just before the war. By 1942, even as \"the world was falling to pieces\", her father still had Anita and her sister Renate discussing sophisticated works such as Friedrich Schiller's tragic play Don Carlos. However, it was \"obvious what was going to happen\", she said.\nIn April 1942, the dreaded order came for her parents to report to a certain location within 24 hours. \"We walked through Breslau, not just my parents but a whole column of people, to this particular point and said goodbye. That was the end. I only understood what my parents must have gone through when I became a parent myself. By then, one had already started to suppress the luxury of feelings.\"\nAnita and Renate were sent to a Jewish orphanage, but they soon hatched a plan to escape from Nazi Germany. Posing as women on their way home to unoccupied France, they set off with two friends for Breslau railway station clutching forged papers. The plan failed and they were arrested by officers of the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police force. Anita served about 18 months in jail on charges of forgery, aiding the enemy and attempted escape, but at least she was relatively safe there. \"Prison is not a pleasant place to be in, but it's not a concentration camp,\" she said. \"Nobody kills you in a prison.\"\u00a0\nIn 1943, because of overcrowding in Breslau prison, any remaining Jewish people were relocated to concentration camps. Anita was put on a train to be taken to Auschwitz, and Renate was sent two weeks later. Anita arrived in the camp at night to find a terrible scene: \"I remember it was very noisy and totally bewildering. You had no idea where you were. Noisy with the dogs, people screaming, a horrible smell... You'd arrived in hell, really.\"\u00a0\nUpon arrival, she was tattooed and shaved by Auschwitz prisoners who were eager for any news about the war. \"I said, 'Look, I can't tell you too much because I've been in prison for a long time,' and casually mentioned that I played the cello. And this girl said, 'Oh, that is very good. You might be saved.' The situation was unbelievable, really. I was naked, I had no hair, I had a number on my arm, and I had this ridiculous conversation.

The violinist ran the camp orchestra with fearsome professionalism, according to Lasker: \"She succeeded in making us so worried about what we were going to play and whether we were playing well that we temporarily didn't worry about what was going to happen to us.\"\nUsing instruments stolen from other people who had been brought to the camp, the orchestra played its limited repertoire of military music. \"Our job was to play marches for the columns that worked outside the camp when they marched out, and in the evening when they came back in,\" she said.\u00a0\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's\u00a0Desert Island Discs\u00a0in 1996, Lasker said that while Ros\u00e9 set \"enormously high standards\", she did not think it was because of a fear of being murdered if they failed to play well. \"It was an escape somehow into excellence,\" she said. \"Somehow you come to terms with the fact that eventually they're going to get you, but whilst they haven't got you, you just carry on. I think one of the ingredients of survival was to be with other people. I think anybody on their own really didn't have a chance.\"\u00a0\nRos\u00e9 did not survive the war, dying of suspected botulism in April 1944. Lasker said: \"I think we owe our lives to Alma. She had a dignity which imposed itself even on the Germans. Even the Germans treated her as if she were a member of the human race.\"\nThe music stopped in October 1944 when the women were transferred to Belsen, a concentration camp where there was no orchestra. Conditions there were unimaginably awful. Lasker said: \"It wasn't actually an extermination camp \u2013 it was a camp where people perished. There were no gas chambers there, no need for gas chambers \u2013 you just died of disease, of starvation.\"\u00a0\nThe liberation of Belsen by British troops in April 1945 saved her life. \"I think another week and we probably wouldn't have made it because there was no food and no water left,\" she said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The man who saved 669 children from the Nazis\n\u2022\u00a0Anne Frank's father on his daughter's diary\n\u2022\u00a0How WW2's D-Day began with a death-defying mission\nAfter the war, Anita and Renate contacted their sister Marianne in the UK, and in 1946 they both settled in Britain. Renate went on to work as an author and journalist, moving to France with her husband in 1982. She died in 2021, 11 days shy of her 97th birthday. Marianne, the eldest sister who was brought to safety on the Kindertransport, died in childbirth soon after the war. \"Such are the ironies of fate,\" she\u00a0told the Guardian in 2005.\nAnita pursued a career as a successful musician, becoming a founder member of the English Chamber Orchestra. On a visit to Paris, she was put in touch with Peter Wallfisch, a piano student and fellow refugee whom she remembered from her school days in Breslau. They married in 1952 and had two children, cello player Raphael and psychotherapist Maya. While Lasker and her husband communicated with each other in \"a total mixture of languages\", she admitted that \"it would have been totally impossible for me to speak German to my children\".\u00a0\nFor decades, she vowed never again to set foot on German soil, fearing that anyone of a certain age could have been \"the very person who murdered my parents\". With the passage of time, she softened her stance, and by 2018 she was invited to Berlin to address politicians in the Bundestag, the German parliament.

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "article_text": "After unearthing a rare collection of highly prized Silk Road artefacts, a family in the Himalayas has opened a museum dedicated to one of the fabled route's final traders.\nMuzzamil Hussain was in grade school when the first bombs fell on the playground outside of his classroom in Kargil, a mountain city in the Indian province of Ladakh. While the violent onset of the 1999 Kargil war between Pakistan and India unfolded around him, Hussain and his family escaped south to the remote Suru Valley.\nAfter India claimed victory later that year and displaced families returned home, Hussain listened as his bedridden grandfather asked the family to visit an old property, originally built by Hussain's great-grandfather, near Kargil's bazaar to make sure it had survived the war. When Hussain's uncles cracked through an old rusty latch and peered through the hand-carved wooden doors, they discovered wooden crates stamped with names of cities around the world. Making space on the dusty floor, the family began to lay out silks from China, silver cookware from Afghanistan, rugs from Persia, turquoise from Tibet, saddles from Mongolia and luxury soaps and salves from London, New York and Munich.\u00a0\nThey had found an abandoned treasure trove \u2013 a collection that would soon become recognised as one of the finest family-owned collections of Silk Road artefacts in India and a discovery that would change the course of Hussain's life.\nThat was 25 years ago. Today, centuries after it provided a crucial-yet-harrowing thoroughfare for Silk Road traders, the Himalayan mountain pass of Zoji La connecting Kashmir to Ladakh is still known as one of the most dangerous roads in the world. On a recent visit, my palms began to sweat as our 4x4 groaned its way higher up the mountainside. I glanced nervously out the window towards a glaciated peak at eye level, and the valley floor more than 1,000m below. No matter how close I pressed my nose against the window, I could not find the edge of the dirt road; just air and a long way to fall. In the front passenger seat, Hussain texted one of the many enterprises he runs with his family, including two hotels, two museums, a conservation NGO and a tour guide service. This was a regular commute for him, and one that his family had braved for centuries.\nI first met Hussain in 2023 while searching for snow leopards in eastern Ladakh. While sipping pink Kashmiri noon chai in a snow flurry at 4,265m, he told me stories of his own remarkable connection to the Silk Road. His flashbacks began with war, flirted with buried treasure and ended in reconciliation. As an archaeologist enamored with mountain history, I needed to learn more, so two years later, I found myself on the Zoji La in the footsteps of Silk Road traders who, like us, hoped to make it to the historic trading hub of Kargil before nightfall.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe mountainous region of Ladakh is situated in the westernmost corner of the Himalayas amongst the disputed borders of India, Pakistan and China. Towering peaks, steep glacial valleys and sweeping alpine plateaus dominate the landscape. Fields of barley blanket sandy floodplains; blindingly white apple and apricot blossoms paint the shores along the Indus River; and on the ridges above, snow leopards and Himalayan brown bears move like wraiths as they search for their next meal. Because of its location at the crossroads of commerce and conquest, modern Ladakh is home to a blend of cultures including Tibetan Buddhists, Muslims and a number of tribal communities.\nThe Silk Road refers to one of the world's largest overland trade routes \u2013 a network that spanned 6,400km connecting Europe to far East Asia. Although named for the Chinese silks that the Roman elite imported during the 1st Century AD, the cross-continental trade system was established much earlier. Once constructed, the network helped transport ideas, religions, commodities and currencies across the ancient world. While the connection between Europe and East Asia was severed in 1453 when the Ottomans boycotted China, segments of the Silk Road continued to exist regionally in places like Ladakh well into the 20th Century.\nA few days after our hair-raising crossing of Zoji La, Hussain and I sat at a small cafe in central Kargil eating dal and sipping masala chai. As the Islamic call to prayer echoed around the mountains of the Zanskar Range and wood smoke drifted in from a nearby bakery, Hussain explain why his family decided to protect and share their great-grandfather's treasure.\nSilk Road Kargil\nThe best way to experience Kargil's Silk Road history is to drive there along the ancient route from Leh or Srinagar. In Kargil, hundreds of artefacts displayed at the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum provide a detailed history of the route's fabled past. Just outside of town, stone-carved Greco-Buddhist-style buddhas from to 5th Century showcase the region's past connections to Central Asia and Mediterranean. For an in depth experience, Roots Ladakh offers a 10-day Silk Road expedition that follows the fabled route from Srinagar to Leh via Zoji La and Kargil.\nAt first, Hussain's family was unsure of what to do with the ancient items. In 2002, Florida Atlantic University anthropologists Dr Jacqueline Fewkes and Nasir Khan heard rumours of the collection and travelled to meet Hussain and his relatives. Recognising the artefacts' importance, the anthropologists encouraged the family to preserve the items for future generations. With Hussain's two uncles serving as the director and curator, the family opened the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum in central Kargil where visitors can explore hundreds of Silk Road artefacts ranging from 18th-Century Ladakhi sheep-horn bows to 19th-Century Chinese copper water pipes. To Fewkes, it is the personal anecdotes and family connection to the collection that makes this museum unique and important.\n\"The Munshi Aziz Bhat [museum] doesn't have to, and should not, be the British Museum or the Smithsonian because it offers its own perspective that is invaluable to both local and global audiences,\" Dr Fewkes told me, \"The stories [here] are focused on identities that are significant to the descendants \u2026 family and local histories provide an alternative understanding about the past than national or international narratives that you would see in larger museums in India or abroad.\"\nWhile his uncles run the day-to-day operations at the museum, Hussain focuses on research and retracing his family history \u2013 a heritage he hopes can provide an opportunity to attract visitors and more importantly, help his community reconcile with a difficult past.\n\"I think it's very important that everybody try to preserve their own family histories,\" added Hussain's uncle, Ajaz Munshi. \"In the age of modernisation, we are often going away from our roots, and we must try to keep our legacies intact.\"\nBorn in Leh in 1866, Hussain's great-grandfather, Munshi Aziz Bhat, travelled to Kargil after finishing school in Skardu (modern-day Pakistan). At that time, Kargil was known as an important hub on the Treaty Road \u2013 a branch of the old Silk Road that connected China to Central Asia via Kashmir.\n\"Kargil has always been tied to many parts of the world,\" Hussain told me. \"Its name literally means 'a place to stop [between kingdoms]'.\" A successful accountant, Bhat moved to Kargil where he started a small trade outpost that, by 1920, had grown into seven shops, an inn for travellers and a stable for the many camels, horses and yaks used by long-distance traders who had travelled for up to three months from places like Lhasa or Yarkand. At its height, Bhat's hub housed traders and goods moving between Central Asia, mainland India, China, Europe and the Americas.\n\"I found it interesting to discover how truly globalised this area was during that time,\" Hussain said. \"This region was really cosmopolitan then.\"\nBut Bhat's business was not to last. In 1948 the borders between India and Pakistan closed when the countries were partitioned, essentially shuttering all long-distance trade in and out of Kargil. Bhat retired as one of the last-known traders along one of the final sections of the Silk Road to close, dying later that year. \"When my great-grandfather closed the building,\" Hussain said, \"the rooms remained under lock and key for almost half a century.\"\u00a0\nThe following day while hiking on a ridge above the Mushkoh Valley, Hussain and I passed rings of rocks and an occasional sandbag that remained from the Kargil war. Since the conflict ended, this area located just a few kilometers from the de facto border with Pakistan, retains a lingering reputation amongst Indians as being war-torn and dangerous.\n\"In Kargil and other places impacted by war, I think there is an identity crisis and lack of pride,\" Hussain explained. \"I think tourism is a great tool to help because when people from the outside come to your community and appreciate your heritage, history and culture, it can help your pride return.\"\nHussain and his brother Tafazzul launched Roots Ladakh in 2013, a travel company focusing on the natural and cultural heritage of Kargil. While most visitors to Ladakh stay near the capital Leh to see Buddhist monasteries and search for snow leopards, Hussain hopes to slowly invite more people to his home.\n\"Our vision is to change the preconceived notion about our region as a warzone through the lens of heritage,\" he explained, poking at a fresh snow leopard track in the mud. \"I reminisce a lot about my ancestors and the interesting people they must have met. Kargil today is a transit location, just like in the past, and I feel like I am continuing that legacy by hosting travellers and guests.\"\nFollowing the old Silk Road, Hussain and I snaked our way up the Suru Valley towards the isolated Buddhist kingdom of Zanskar. Turning a corner, I saw three elderly women walking beneath the tongue of a massive glacier, carrying large stacks of hay on their backs. They were preparing for winter while chatting and walking to their homes, which were several steep kilometers away. Hussain offered them and their goods a ride. As the women climbed in, one asked what news Hussain had from the outside world.\nJust as his great-grandparents had done, Hussain turned towards his multicultural band of weary travellers and began to relay stories of politics, trade and faraway lands.\u00a0\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

You're entitled to your opinion.\nBut what's not in doubt is that they all went viral on YouTube, which is now 20 years old.\nIt's become the place where 2.5 billion people log on monthly to kill time, be entertained and, sometimes at least, learn something.\nBut it's also been life-changing for some of its breakout stars, like Charlie.\nYou wouldn't recognise him now but millions around the world have watched him, as a baby, chomping on his big brother's digits. \nThat's because he's the star of Charlie Bit My Finger.\n\"It was never not a part of my life, it's always been there,\" Charlie, who's now 18, tells BBC Newsbeat.\nThe 55-second clip has had almost 900 million views since it was uploaded in 2007.\nCharlie says he can't remember the moment, filmed when he was \"about one\" and sitting on Harry's lap.\nHe says the clip's success has made life \"easier\" and helped him get to university where he now studies law.\nHis dad Howard Davies-Carr previously told Newsbeat the family had made an estimated \u00a31,000,000 off the video over the years.\nThe video was sold as a non-fungible token, or NFT, for \u00a3500,000 in 2021.\nBut Mr Davies-Carr said he wanted to keep the boys \"very grounded\" in how they live their lives.\nCharlie shares that view and says he doesn't play the \"don't you know who I am?\" card.\n\"It's not like I use it as an icebreaker or anything,\" he says. \n\"I was never going to use this as a fun fact.\"\nCharlie says he doesn't want to be seen as a show-off, so when asked about himself volunteers \"something else a bit more boring\".\n\"But my friends like to tell people [sometimes], so it's hard keeping it locked down,\" says. \n\"It slips out every now and then.\n\"And people are like: 'Oh that's cool', for like five minutes. Or they say: 'I don't know what that is.'\"\nYouTube was founded on 14 February 2005 by three friends - Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim - all former employees of the online payment system PayPal.\nWhile the first video published on 23 April 2005 was not quite Baby Shark, it did have an animal theme. \nIt was a 19-second clip called Me at the zoo, posted by co-founder Jawed.\nThe founders opened the first YouTube headquarters in an office above a California pizza restaurant.\nIt is now owned by Google and has offices all over the world.\nIn the UK, 82% of adult internet users in the UK have reported using the platform - more than WhatsApp (80%), Facebook (76%) and Instagram (57%).\nNow YouTube is a destination many choose for the latest trailers, reviews and news.\nBut it is music videos which dominate the most-viewed list, with Baby Shark Dance having more than 15 billion watches.\nDespacito by Luis Fonsi has more than eight billion, Shape of You by Ed Sheeran has more than six billion views and PSY's Gangnam Style has 5.4 billion.\nAnd while Charlie's family has been helped by income from YouTube, some of its biggest names have made a fortune.\nAmerican YouTuber MrBeast, a.k.a Jimmy Donaldson, is the most popular YouTuber with more than 360 million subscribers.\nBusiness magazine Forbes estimates that he earned $85 million (\u00a368 million) in 2024, making him the highest-paid creator.\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing in the platform's two decades.\nFact-checking organisations around the world have previously said that YouTube is not doing enough to prevent misinformation on the platform.\nThe site has also been punished for privacy violations, being fined $170m (\u00a3139m) by a US regulator for violating children's privacy laws.\nIn 2023, it was accused of collecting the viewing data of children aged under 13, in breach of a UK data privacy code.\nAnd there has been criticism that, like other online platforms, violent and extremist videos have been available to view despite government calls for their removal.\nJournalist Tamzin Kraftman, who covers technology news, feels while the platform has managed to stay relevant against competition from TikTok and Instagram, there are challenges with combating things like misinformation.\n\"No team can go through everything with a fine-toothed comb,\" she says.\n\"So the question is how they will ensure everything on there is correct and within regulations.\"\nTamzin tells Newsbeat AI could play a big role in helping to deal with those issues, but \"might get things wrong and could ban the wrong channel\".\n\"I think it's how they use new tools to really stop the spread of misinformation that is going to be their golden ticket [going forward].\"\nAnd Charlie doesn't think the platform is \"dying out\" any time soon, years on from his flutter with fame.\nWhile he doesn't remember loads from then, he is grateful for the opportunities it has brought.\nHe has managed to travel \"a decent amount\" and been to the United States, filming a flight-safety video.\nAs for whether he's tried to recreate the bite?\n\"I haven't since I was very young.\n\"I could start charging now.

        "article_text": "Winter isn't all bad \u2013 these \"sublime\" landscapes of the frozen North from the turn of the 20th Century offer us a way into resilience \u2013 and an \"acceptance of the seasonality of life\".\nWith its bare trees, long nights and icy temperatures, it's perhaps unsurprising that, culturally in the Northern Hemisphere, we seem so conditioned to complain about winter. Yet, as the author Katherine May points out in her 2020 book Wintering, winter is also a valuable time for rest and retreat. \"Winter offers us liminal spaces to inhabit,\" she writes. Its \"starkness\", she argues, re-sensitises us, and \"can reveal colours that we would otherwise miss\".\nFor Nordic countries, where, in some regions, the season can last more than six months, making peace with winter is a necessity, with concepts such as the Norwegian friluftsliv\u00a0(embracing the natural world) and the Danish hygge (hunkering down with simple comforts) offering fresh perspectives on cold weather.\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, the frozen North \u2013 with its vast fjords, mystical boreal forests and radiant light \u2013 became a powerful muse for artists such as Hilma af Klint, Edvard Munch and Harald Sohlberg. These artists immersed themselves in these cold climates, and developed a specifically Nordic style of painting imbued with their emotional responses to the landscape. Around 70 of these intensely atmospheric, expressionist works by artists from Scandinavia, Finland and Canada are being showcased in a new exhibition, Northern Lights, a cross-Atlantic collaboration that debuts at the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, before travelling to New York's Buffalo AKG Art Museum in August.\nIt was natural that these painters should be drawn to these wintery scenes, Ulf K\u00fcster, the exhibition's curator, tells the BBC. \"In Nordic landscapes, snow is a very dominant factor of life from October to late April\u2026 It's just this massive presence of white and nature and wilderness and vastness that really defines this landscape, and I think these painters have found a very interesting response to that.\" This burst of Nordic landscape painting was also a response to the changes that the painters perceived as a result of population growth and industrialisation. \"There was a big desire in the late 19th Century to return to pure nature and the simple life,\" explains K\u00fcster. \"You had these highly industrialised countries and pollution, and the pureness of white snow must have been quite a contrast.\" \u00a0\nMany of these northern regions were comparatively untouched by change, and featured vast, unpopulated vistas that were inherently painterly. Even today, Norway has a population of just 5.5 million, but a length of around 1,600km; while around three-quarters of Finland is still forested. To convey this scale, these paintings often adopt unconventional compositions where the view appears to stretch beyond the canvas. They are \"boundless\", says K\u00fcster. \"They don't have borders\". This is reinforced by the bird's-eye view adopted in works such as View from Pyynikki Ridge (1900) by the Finnish artist Helmi Biese. \"It's as if the artists have used a drone,\" remarks K\u00fcster.\nThe height and scope of these unpopulated views also convey a sense of isolation and loneliness. Harald Sohlberg, whose luminescent 1914 version of Winter Night in the Mountains is widely considered to be the national painting of Norway, wrote: \"The longer I stood gazing at the scene, the more I seemed to feel what a solitary and pitiful atom I was in an endless universe\u2026 It was as if I had suddenly awakened in a new, unimagined and inexplicable world\u2026 Above the white contours of a northern winter stretched the endless vault of heaven, twinkling with myriads of stars. It was like a service in some vast cathedral.\"\u00a0\nIt was this search for solitude that doubtless drew the Swedish artist Anna Boberg to the Norwegian archipelago of Lofoten, a remote location steeped in Viking folklore and, according to her 1901 memoir, \"the apotheosis of Arctic beauty and wilderness\". It was here, dressed head-to-toe in seal and reindeer fur, that she produced her Northern Lights (1901) painting, most likely sketched en plein air. In a commanding scene that speaks to the Romantic notion of \"the sublime\", prismatic streaks of light descend from the heavens dwarfing the snowy landscape.\nBoberg's awe when confronted with this dazzling wintry world with its unique light is clear. \"What really drove these people was to find a response to the extremities of nature \u2013 the very essence of snow, winter and ice.\" explains K\u00fcster. To achieve this, they would \"get as close to nature as possible\", he says. Far from hiding from the harsh winter, Boberg and her contemporaries immersed themselves in the landscape. \"They are painters who really wanted to paint the experience, to feel the extreme temperature and the snow blindness,\" says K\u00fcster. Munch, he continues, had outdoor studios, and would leave his paintings outside \"just to let nature test them\", while some of the Canadian painters would paddle out on to lakes and paint from their canoes. \u00a0\nInland, the boreal forest embodied the enchanting duality of these landscapes, which were both beautiful and barbaric. The dark, primeval forests became an emblem of foreboding in Nordic folklore and myth \u2013 places where you could get lost, and that concealed unknown dangers. The Nordic winter landscape fed the fairytales of the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. \"Below them the wind blew cold, wolves howled, and black crows screamed as they skimmed across the glittering snow,\" he writes in The Snow Queen (1844). \"But up above, the moon shone bright and large.\"\nThis storybook quality can be seen in Winter Moonlight (1895) by the Swedish painter Gustaf Fjaestad. Here, his clever use of pointillism makes the snow appear to glitter, while the hand-like branches of the dense, drooping trees look poised to come alive. In The Lair of the Lynx (1908), Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a Finn, also revels in this tantalising, darker side to the landscape, inviting us to scan the canvas for the dark places beasts may be lurking, and to follow their tracks in the snow.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eight nature books to change your life\n\u2022\u00a0The climate warnings in 19th-Century paintings\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nNotable, also, is the power and movement he gives to the snow as it winds in thick layers around the trees. \"The brushwork of this painting meticulously reacts to the layers of snow,\" says K\u00fcster. \"It's snowing, then it's freezing, there might be some sun and there's a little thaw, and then there's freezing again and more snow comes on top.\" The painter is clearly entranced by the snow, the layers of paint telling the snow's story. The visual effect, observes K\u00fcster, is \"like a sort of wedding cake\".\nAs well as drawing inspiration from the landscape's mythical associations, these artists participated in their own myth-making, expressing \u2013 through their own strong emotional responses to these unspoilt regions \u2013 an often idealised view of the Nordic winter. Some, such as Edvard Munch, nevertheless hinted at the changes threatening these serene expanses. During the winter of 1900, he stayed in Nordstrand on the banks of the Oslofjord. Here he painted his now-famous rendition of its serene waters reflecting a magnificent sky of pink, blue and yellow. But this picturesque, swirling scene, foregrounded by pines, is interrupted by a bulbous trail of white paint, denoting, not snow this time, but, as the title makes clear, Train Smoke.\n\"When we look back at the landscape works of Gallen-Kallela and Biese, we are reminded of how much of the environment has changed in the intervening century,\" writes Anna-Maria Pennonen in her essay Changing Landscapes in the exhibition catalogue. \"The Baltic Sea no longer freezes every winter, and the period when the ground is covered with snow in Helsinki can be very short, perhaps only a few weeks instead of months.\" As for the magnificent boreal forest, it continues to be threatened by logging and agriculture.\nRecognising the mutability of these environments now adds a powerful new dimension when a modern audience engages with these 100-year-old works. \"They ask us to think about the enchanting image of the forest in relation to its past and current transformation, as well as in relation to our own part therein,\" writes Helga Christoffersen in the catalogue. The works invite feelings of nostalgia and melancholy, and our appreciation that they are endangered only amplifies their beauty and psychological intensity.\nDanish artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen, born in 1987, addresses this issue of climate change in Boreal Dreams (2024), an interactive, immersive work and online experience, commissioned for Northern Lights. The work uses virtual reality to connect past, present and future boreal ecosystems. It takes visitors on a journey into five imagined futures for the boreal forest, marrying technology with environmental data to create a visceral experience of nature. Yet, however bleak the future seems, raw nature \u2013 \u00a0these works suggest \u2013 can offer something transcendent. \"We like to think that it's possible for life to be one eternal summer,\" writes May in Wintering. \"But life's not like that.\" By confronting and reframing winter, as these artists do, we can accept the seasonality of life, and cope better with the dark periods of our life. \"Winter had blanked me, blasted me wide open,\" she declares. \"In all that whiteness, I saw the chance to make myself new again.\"\u00a0\nNorthern Lights is at the Fondation Beyeler in Riehen/Basel in Switzerland until 25 May and at Buffalo AKG Art Museum, Buffalo, New York, from 1 August 2025 to 12 January 2026. The accompanying catalogue, edited by Ulf K\u00fcster, will be published by Hatje Cantz on 13 February.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Everton fans greet their team before the final Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Goodison Park\nGoodison Park is one of the grand sporting theatres, and the final Merseyside derby played out at the old place delivered the dramatic last act it deserved before the doors are finally locked.\nThe concluding scenes included a 98th-minute equaliser from James Tarkowski, only given after the stadium held its breath for several minutes while the video assistant referee checked for offside and a foul.\nAnd then, when the goal was awarded to give Everton a deserved 2-2 draw, tempers boiled over with Abdoulaye Doucoure needlessly taunting Liverpool's fans, to the annoyance of Curtis Jones, sparking a full-on brawl that saw both sent off.\nThey were followed by Liverpool head coach Arne Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff, who were furious with referee Michael Oliver, as this derby descended into chaos with police, stewards and players all involved.\nEverton manager David Moyes said: \"It was mayhem all game. A bit of a throwback. The place was boiling hot all night.

It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany of Doge's staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later said he was operating as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation is officially defined as those working for the government for 130 days or less in a year.\nTo some supporters of this new body, Doge's outsider status - as well as its somewhat vague mandate - will increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIts mission, says Musk, is to save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn).\nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nMusk has said he wants to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", what he describes as a fourth branch of government working against Trump's agenda. Critics of his work see a simpler ideological motivation at play.\n\"They are not going to go into agencies that are doing things they like. They are going into agencies they disagree with,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Republican director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), told Reuters news agency.\nIt is unclear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates on what they say has been cut. Among its headline-making actions are:\n\nDoge enjoys broad popular support, a poll by the BBC's US partner CBS News has suggested. \nThis indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - supported its work, even if they disagreed over how much influence Musk should have personally.\nThe size of the permanent workforce currently exceeds two million and one of the largest increases was in 2023, partly due to major investment by the Biden administration in infrastructure projects.\nDavid Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, says Doge's work is needed. \n\"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they asking, whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\"\nPolitical opponents and government watchdogs accuse Doge of acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.\nCritics highlight Musk's potential conflicts of interest, given the billions in contracts his businesses hold with the US government. Trump and Musk deny that any issues will arise.\nMultiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans, and Democrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.\nSeveral times, the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records.\nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Musk said he expected to be scrutinised for his work, but insisted that Americans had voted for \"common sense\" government reform.\nBut pundits question whether he can enact his bold pledges.\nElaine Kamark, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told the BBC that efforts to streamline government spending \"can be done\", highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\nBut she labelled Musk's idea of slashing a third of government spending \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.\nWith additional reporting by Jessica Parker and Cai Pigliucci",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's future is the focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), just days after a shock phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the Ukraine war.\nDescribing the call earlier this week as \"great\", Trump said there was a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war\". \nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country must not be left out of any peace talks.\nEuropean allies seemed surprised at the nature of the call, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning that any peace agreement which involved capitulating to Russia would end \"badly for everyone\".\nIt is still unclear when peace negotiations could begin, but when they do issues around territory, security negotiations and Ukraine's future in Nato will be among the key topics for discussion. Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "Greenlandic politician and Inuit educator Aleqa Hammond shares her top ways to experience the country, from sampling Greenlandic cuisine to viewing the Northern Lights in Ilulissat.\nAt a staggering 2.16 million sq km, Greenland is the world's largest island \u2013 and its least densely populated. A colossal ice sheet covers roughly 80% of its mass; most of the population (56,000) lives in urban areas along its south-west coast.\u00a0\nThe Specialist\nAleqa Hammond is a politician and former member of the Greenland Parliament. Her political career began in 2005 when she held various ministerial roles, including Minister of Finances and Foreign Affairs. In 2013, she became Greenland's first female Prime Minister.\nBut Greenland still attracts visitors with its stunning natural backdrop of glaciers and icebergs. Adventurers enjoy kayaking, hiking and dog sledding in the vast wilderness. The midnight sun, Northern Lights and colourful villages only add to this Arctic destination's allure.\nWe asked Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister (2013-2014), how to explore this land of contrasts. \"Greenland is so vast and huge and undiscovered in many ways that after the Ilulissat Icefjord received a World Heritage site designation in 2004, it was not recognised by Unesco again for another 13 years,\" she says. \"It has three now, which shows that the country has so much to offer.\"\nIn November 2024, Nuuk International Airport opened in the country's capital. And in 2026, two more international airports will open \u2013 in Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest city, and Qaqortoq, in southern Greenland. As Greenlanders prepare for an influx of visitors, Hammond is optimistic. \"Everybody wants this change because we want to have a stronger economy, and we want to be more self-sufficient.\"\nAccording to the Greenlandic Ministry of Business, Trade, Mineral Resources, Justice and Gender Equality, over the past five years, tourism in Greenland has grown by 46%; primarily due to a surge in demand from travellers eager to explore new destinations after Covid-19 \u2013 particularly those with wide-open spaces. The numbers are expected to rise with the new airports.\nBut \"Greenland does not want mass tourism,\" says Hammond. \"Greenland wants better tourism. We want tourism that's to the benefit of the people of this country, not to overwhelm us. It's going to be a very controlled place, and that makes it special.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hammond's favourite ways to experience Greenland.\nNuuk, Greenland's capital, is home to approximately 20,000 residents. But \"it's very much a metropolitan city\", says Hammond. \"There's museums, there's cafes, there's so many shopping opportunities and concerts, it's so alive.\"\nLocated in Nuuk's Colonial Harbour, the Greenland National Museum & Archives is a fascinating place to delve into the country's history and culture. \"The museum is absolutely worth visiting,\" Hammond says. \"It's well organised and it's doing a lot of archaeological excavations in remote places in Greenland.\"\nThe best of 2025\nGreenland was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list\u00a0here.\nThe museum's exhibitions cover a vast span of Greenland's history, from the first Paleo-Eskimo cultures that arrived thousands of years ago to a period of Norse settlement in the 10th Century and Thule migration in the 13th Century, followed by Danish colonisation in the 18th Century.\nThe museum is also known for its collection of well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies \u2013 the naturally mummified remains of a family from Northern Greenland's Paleo-Eskimo Saqqaq culture, who lived sometime between 2500 BCE to 800 BCE. \"They are the oldest mummies in the world of Inuit heritage,\" says Hammond, who is Inuit as well as a respected Inuit educator and former commissioner of the\u00a0Inuit Circumpolar Council.\u00a0\"These mummies were found in 1972 in the Uummannaq area of North Greenland, where I'm from.\"\nExhibiting the mummies hasn't been without controversy. \"It was a big discussion back then whether they should belong to a museum or not, and a lot of Greenlanders were not very happy that they ended up there,\" Hammond says. \"Today, everybody's satisfied because [of] world interest on how the Inuit have been living and are living, and what cultural heritage we have. This is the oldest proof.\"\nWebsite:\u00a0https://en.nka.gl/\nAddress: Hans Egedesvej 8, Box 145, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 32 26 11\nInstagram:\u00a0@natmus_gl\nWhen it comes to fine dining in Nuuk, one of Hammond's favourites is Restaurant Sarfalik, which is located on the top floor of the upscale Hotel Hans Egede in the city centre. Sarfalik specialises in showcasing the best of Greenlandic cuisine, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced from local hunters and fishermen. A blend of Inuit tradition and survival, cooking techniques include drying, fermenting and smoking.\n\"Using local ingredients is a trend in Greenland,\" Hammond says. \"We have such great resources, and each town has its own open fish and meat market with a choice of musk ox, reindeer, halibut and cod. Everything is there.\"\nSarfalik has an open layout with a cosy brasserie feel, and the menu features traditional Greenlandic fare with a modern twist as well as internationally inspired creations. There's also a tasting menu that allows for sampling various entrees. \"It's not enormous plates, but very beautiful and wonderfully made,\" Hammond says. \"It's a gastronomic experience.\"\nWebsite: https://hhe.gl/restaurant-sarfalik/?lang=en\nAddress: Hotel Hans Egede, Aqqusinersuaq 1 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 34 80 00\nInstagram: @sarfalik\nA significant cultural hub, Nuuk Art Museum features a mix of Greenlandic and international art. \"Because we have many artists in Nuuk, it's very well-visited, and it's a big museum that's absolutely worth a trip,\" says Hammond.\nA gift from Danish-Greenlandic philanthropists Svend and Helene Junge Pedersen to the people of Nuuk, the museum is situated in city centre in a former Adventist church, striking for its high ceilings, wooden beams and stained-glass windows. In addition to exhibitions, the museum also hosts events, workshops and educational programmes, such as an art walk around the city that can be downloaded as a podcast.\nIts primary focus is to showcase the work of Greenlandic artists and the depiction of Greenland in art. This includes a significant number of works by early 20th-Century landscape artist Emanuel A Petersen, known for his romanticised portrayals of Greenlandic nature. The museum's exhibits showcase a variety of media, including paintings, watercolours, drawings and sculptures made from materials like soapstone, ivory and wood.\n\"Greenlandic art is an expression of Inuit culture, which is deeply connected to the land, wildlife and Arctic traditions,\" Hammond says. \"Our spirits, legends, and traditional beliefs are also often depicted, as well as animals important for survival like seals, whales and polar bears.\"\nWebsite: https://www.nuukkunstmuseum.com/\nAddress: Kissarneqqortuunnguaq 5, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 36 60 33\nInstagram: @nuukartmuseum\nDepending on the time of year, the Northern Lights are literally all around. \"It's like trees,\" Hammond says. \"You don't really notice them unless one specific tree is really beautiful. We don't have trees here, but there's a lot of Northern Lights.\"\nTip\nTo view Greenland's Northern Lights, \"from September until February is a perfect time\", says Hammond. \"Greenland has long, dark nights during this period, and clearer skies compared to other seasons. When we know that there's going to be a very good Northern Lights night, we put on a lot of clothes, bring our tea and take a hike around the village. Then we just sit there and enjoy it. And nobody says a word for a very long time, because this beauty is so much more than 1,000 words.\"\nDespite their frequent occurrence, the Northern Lights are also a reminder of Hammond's heritage, so she never takes them for granted.\n\"The Northern Lights have both entertainment and cultural value,\" she says. \"We know who they are \u2013 that's our ancestors, and that's why we love watching them. We honour our ancestors a lot, and we can always see them in our environment. In Greenland, you can see them in the sky.\"\nWitnessing the Northern Lights is especially meaningful at the Ilulissat Icefjord, a deep sea inlet filled with massive icebergs. A Unesco World Heritage site, it is one of the fastest moving and most active glaciers in the world, moving around 40m per day.\n\"It's very easy to walk out to the Icefjord at night because there's a boardwalk and you can take it out to a bench with the best view in the world,\" Hammond says. \"Sit on that bench and you'll be right in front of the icebergs. The Northern Lights give a special light to the icefjord, and the icebergs get another glow, another colour. It's the ultimate Northern Lights experience.\"\nLocated on the west coast, Ilulissat is about 250km north of the Arctic Circle. Historically a fishing village, it is also known for its sled dogs. The Icefjord is a short bus ride from town and the boardwalk is easily accessible as it extends from the car park.\nThe Ilulissat Icefjord Centre is situated on the edge of the icefjord and provides interactive displays, artefacts and scientific data.\nWebsite:\u00a0https://isfjordscentret.gl/en/ilulissat-icefjord-centre/\nAddress: Sermermiut Aqqutaa B 2089, 3952 Ilulissat\nPhone: +299 55 55 88\nInstagram:\u00a0@ilulissat_isfjordscentret\nGreenland is as famous for its epic wildlife as it is for its stunning Northern Lights. Depending on the region, you might see reindeer, musk oxen, polar bears, Arctic foxes and a variety of whales \u2013 including elusive narwhals with their unicorn-like tusks.\nHammond suggests admiring the island's wildlife via both land and sea by combining a city break with an expedition cruise like Adventure Canada, which offers six Greenland itineraries with plans to expand to East Greenland in 2025.\nThe best chance to spot polar bears is in East Greenland because, according to Hammond, \"the big impact of the North Pole ice melting is that they are all going that way\". Arctic wildlife \u2013 both marine and mammal \u2013 can be spotted via a small ship cruise or by hiking the Arctic Circle Trail. Because polar bears are powerful predators, observing them from a ship provides a safe vantage point and minimises risks. Arctic cruises are the best ways to spot marine wildlife, especially whales, seals and walruses.\n\"Fly into Greenland first, and then take your own trip, maybe from Nuuk to Ilulissat or vice versa, and go on from there,\" she says. \"You can come in a few days ahead of time and experience the authentic Greenland for yourself by partaking in activities like hiking before you embark on the cruise. Greenland has incredible hiking trails, and the further you venture into the wilderness, the more likely you are to encounter animals.\"\nWebsite: https://www.adventurecanada.com/\nPhone: +1 800 363 7566\nInstagram: @adventure.canada\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Cologne are top of the German second division after winning their past three league games\n\"It's chaos,\" says German football journalist Mark Lovell, when asked to describe the 2. Bundesliga title race this season - and he is right.\nWith 13 games remaining in this campaign, the battle for the two automatic promotion places - plus the single play-off spot against the 16th-placed Bundesliga side - in the German second tier is the most engrossing race in European football this season.\nJust six points separate the top six after 21 matches, with 10 points between the top 10 in the 18-team league. Seven sides have led the division and more than a quarter of games have ended in draws.\nThe clubs involved come from every walk of German football life too. \nCurrent leaders Cologne are Bundesliga regulars who suffered relegation last season, and have defied a two-window transfer ban which ended in January to achieve their lofty rank.\nThe top 10 of the 2. Bundesliga table after 21 games\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nCologne sit two points ahead of former European Cup winners Hamburg, spending their seventh-straight season in 2. Bundesliga having previously never been relegated from the top flight, and four-time national champions Kaiserslautern.\nFor Kaiserslautern, this season is the latest step in a remarkable recent history which saw them fall into the third tier in 2018 for four years amid financial hardship, before a recent recovery and even reaching the German Cup final last season.\n\"They just barely scraped by one year and right now they're on the rebound,\" George Brown, founder of the American Kaiserslautern Fan Club, tells BBC Sport.\n\"Kaiserslautern has a population of just under 100,000. Towns of this size in Germany normally have a stadium of about 12,000 [but] they have a stadium of almost 50,000. They believe that their place is up at the top level in the Bundesliga.\"\nA further three points back are Magdeburg, the only side from the old East Germany to win a European trophy \u2013 the 1974 Cup Winners' Cup \u2013 but who have never played in the Bundesliga.\nMost remarkably of all, all nine of their league wins this season have come in away games, their 10 home matches delivering seven draws and three defeats.\nThere are other contenders too. Fortuna Dusseldorf, who missed out on promotion last season after throwing away a three-goal lead in the play-off, have led the league for longer than any other side and sit fifth. Just below are recognisable names like Hannover and Nuremberg, not forgetting SV Elversberg who are spending just their second season at this level \u2013 yet led the division as late as matchday 16.\nMagdeburg are in promotion contention after winning nine of their 11 away league games this season\nAnd for the final ingredient, add an average attendance of more than 30,000 fans per game. This is boosted by huge crowds at former Champions League sides Hertha Berlin and Schalke, though they are 13th and 14th respectively, and more concerned about relegation.\nSo yes, it's chaos \u2013 but why is it so close?\nAccording to Lovell, a key factor is money \u2013 but unlike its English counterpart it is  a lack thereof, rather than an imbalanced abundance.\n\"It's not distorted like the Championship is with these parachute payments coming down, Premier League clubs being rewarded for failure with these huge lumps of cash,\" he says.\n\"In German football, they do have a better TV deal then they've had historically but it is nothing like the Championship. It is quite a struggle to get back immediately to the top flight.\n\"Look at Hamburg. Former European champions, Kevin Keegan [as a former player], they were the reason I got interested in German football, they were historically one of the biggest clubs in Germany and very proud of their record of never being relegated from the top flight. \n\"They were termed the dinosaur because they were never going to get relegated but that fate happened and they haven't been able to get back.\"\nRobert Stokowy, a former Cologne native who is now part of the FC Cologne Supporters USA group, says this title race is the result of smaller, well-run clubs colliding with monoliths experiencing tougher times.\n\"There's pressure from below, and there's pressure from the first division,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"Cologne are an elevator team. Last season we just got beaten badly, and if you look at the Bundesliga right now you have such a discrepancy between how much money teams have, and there's just no way that that is a healthy and interesting competition.\n\"What we have [in 2.Bundesliga] is a couple more investors, so some of the clubs from the third division get picked up and all of a sudden they get elevated \u2013 look at the rise of Heidenheim and Union Berlin.\n\"I think the second division is the sweet spot because there is some TV revenue, there's an interesting mix of clubs from the first division who had glory days back then, and you have the ones who come up from the lower leagues.\n\"It is an example of what you can do if you run your club well.\"\nHamburg spent 55 straight seasons in the Bundesliga before their current seven-year stint in the second division\nThat excitement has drawn in the spectators and Marco Fuchs and Maike Baensch, chair and deputy of The Supporters Karlsruhe, say membership has tripled.\nKarlsruhe however are one of the victims of such a fickle league as a run of four winless games has sent them tumbling from second to 10th.\n\"It's a difficult situation,\" says Baensch. \"You want people to be engaged in the league, enjoying every game but at the same time it's frustrating and demoralising to think that you're right up there and then all of a sudden you're back in mid table.\"\nNo fan or club, Brown says, can be confident in predicting what the season will hold in the final 13 matches. \n\"All the conversations that I've seen are incredibly cautious,\" he says. \"One of the things that everybody always says is you don't ever talk about a promotion until you get 40 points. The theory is no team has ever been relegated that had 40 points or more.\n\"But it certainly has made every single match incredible. It doesn't matter if you're the home or away team, it doesn't matter if you're playing the last place team or the first. You have no idea what you're going to get and that just builds excitement and drives people to the stadium.\n\"I wouldn't advise people to gamble on this league because you just never know what's going to happen,\" adds Lovell. \"Top can beat bottom, and just because you were in the Bundesliga last season doesn't guarantee anything.\"",

        "article_text": "Marcel Duchamp\u2019s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart \u2013 and at its 17th-Century predecessor.\nThis year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history \u2013 a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.\nMore like this:\n- When the Parthenon had dazzling colours\n- The insect that painted Europe red\n- The subversive power of the pipe\nThe work in question is awkwardly proportioned \u2013 over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall \u2013 and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um\u2019, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m\u2019ennuies, or \u2018you bore me\u2019) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making \u2013 found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel \u2013 that he christened \u2018readymades\u2019.\nIn stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, \u201cDuchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.\u201d Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.\nAnyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these \u2018readymade\u2019 swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp\u2019s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp\u2019s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp\u2019s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues \u2013 a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades \u2013 a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp\u2019s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of \u2018A. Boogert\u2019 \u2013 a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert\u2019s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel\u2019s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author\u2019s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp\u2019s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert\u2019s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp\u2019s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life\u2019s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making \u2013 found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel \u2013 that he christened \u2018readymades\u2019.Yale University Art GalleryAn array of colourful tiles stretches across these shapes, foreshadowing today\u2019s colour charts (Credit: Yale University Art Gallery)In stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.Yale University Art GalleryDuchamp\u2019s mysterious T\u2019um features shadowy allusions to the sculptures he called \u2018readymades\u2019 (Credit: Yale University Art Gallery)At the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.Titians of industrySuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour.",

        "article_text": "Nada Hafez competed for Egypt in the women's individual sabre fencing event at the Paris Olympics while seven months pregnant\n\"I was thinking about my baby, that I want my baby to be an Olympian.\" \nThat was the extra motivation that Egyptian fencer Nada Hafez needed when she took to the piste at Paris 2024.\nOnly a select few knew she was competing while seven months pregnant until she revealed the news on social media following her last-16 exit from her event. \nIt made headlines the world over.\nThe whirlwind reaction was like nothing Hafez had experienced before.\n\"I was just posting on my personal account - proud, saying I'm in the top 16 in the world while pregnant,\" Hafez told BBC Sport Africa. \n\"I didn't expect this would go viral. I didn't know what was going on.\"\nThe 27-year-old says the majority of responses to her message were positive.\n\"When the post went up, and I was an inspiration for everyone, this was a big thing for me.\"\nHafez, who is a clinical pathologist, says she had been given clearance from doctors to fence at the Games and wanted to show the world what a woman's body can do.\n\"This was a really important message for me - an Egyptian Arab woman - to tell all women that your body can surprise you,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes you need to see an example in front of you to know that you can do it. \n\"Because maybe a pregnant woman, she's afraid to do anything, and now she tells herself: 'There's a woman who competes at the Olympics while pregnant. So I can do whatever'.\"\nHafez upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky of the United States, in her first match at Paris 2024\nBut not everyone was so supportive of Hafez revealing that she fenced in the women's individual sabre at the Grand Palais while carrying a baby.\nA day later Hafez put out another Instagram post to emphasise she was not the first pregnant woman to appear at an Olympics and that she had wanted to \"shed light on the strength, perseverance and relentlessness\" of Egyptian women.\nThat strength came to the fore when dealing with negativity online.\n\"Some people don't want to see you succeed,\" she reflected.\n\"It's easy to put a comment and run. You don't face me.\n\"I wanted to clarify that I'm a doctor and this (competing while pregnant) is something that is not against any medical issues.\n\"Some people were saying I should have given the place to someone else. But this was not an option because I qualified.\n\"My mum told me 'Don't be sad if you read anything' - but I'm proud of what I did. I achieved something and it was very challenging.\"\nWith fencing being a combat sport using swords, could that have provoked the negative comments?\n\"For me, fencing is not as it looks - it has this sense of touch. My doctor assured me that it's not unsafe.\"\nHafez took up fencing aged 12 and has appeared at the past three editions of the Olympic Games\nCairo-based Hafez, who pursued her passion for fencing while studying for her medical degree, became an Egyptian sabre champion and went to both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games. \nSo, having qualified for Paris 2024, did she consider pulling out when she discovered she was pregnant? \n\"Yes, of course. I knew I was pregnant a week before a World Cup [event], and I said, 'Okay, I won't chance it because it's my first pregnancy',\" she explained.\n\"I didn't know how I would feel. \n\"I was waiting for my husband [a cardiothoracic surgeon] to tell me to stop and take rest. But he told me: 'We'll go to the doctor. Whatever he says, we'll do.'\n\"And the doctor said: 'You don't have a disease. You're just pregnant. If you're okay and everything is normal, you can do whatever you want.'\"\nWith that reassurance, Hafez felt ready to resume training. \nMindful of the spotlight falling on her nation if the news came out, she kept it as quiet as she could.\n\"I didn't have to tell anyone, because it's not against Olympic regulations,\" she said.\n\"I just told the people who needed to know. The most important thing was not to go against any laws or health conditions.\n\"I didn't know if I would make it so I took it step by step until I reached the Olympics.\"\nEgypt's National Olympic Committee told BBC Sport Africa it has no rules barring pregnant women from training or competing.\n\"But it has to be a safe environment and we have to make sure there is no risk involved,\" an official said.\nNada Hafez was full of emotion after she made it through to the last 16 of the Paris Games, her third Olympics having also competed at at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020\nNow a mum to four-month-old baby Zaina, Hafez can reflect on the part her daughter played in her achievements in Paris.\n\"I worked with my mental coach. I wanted to do something different for my baby,\" she said.\n\"I tried not to think that I have my excuse not to win. I thought differently: 'I'm pregnant and I will win', and I did it.\"\nHafez went on to upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky, 15-13.\n\"It's one of the best results for female Egyptian Olympians,\" Hafez added.\n\"I was crying with happiness. This is something for my baby to be proud of.\"\nShe then lost 15-7 to Jeon Hayoung of South Korea in the last 16.\nNeither of her opponents knew Hafez was expecting. \n\"It's unfair if someone knows. Maybe they'd be afraid to put a touch or something, so no need to tell them.\"\nHafez, who is studying for a masters degree alongside being a new mum, is aiming to use her platform to stand up for women's rights in sport.\nShe has not yet decided whether she wants to try and qualify for Los Angeles 2028.\nFor now, she is still processing what she achieved in Paris.\n\"Young girls told me, 'You've inspired us so much. We want to go to medical school and continue in sports',\" she said.\n\"And that made me happiest.\n\"Whenever I get a message from anyone telling me I'm a role model it sets my heart on fire - because that's what I'm working on for my whole life.\n\"I'm still young. I'm aiming to do more and be a good example as a mum.\n\"I hope my daughter will be an Olympian one day. She's a baby Olympian - and maybe she'll be an adult Olympian.\"",

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The 'missing middle' of small businesses\n\u2022\u00a0Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love\n\u2022\u00a0Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things\nWhere do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?\nMy perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.\nI'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world.

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature. If we aren't, well, we probably don't really believe something is inherently better because it's natural.\nMeanwhile, there are hundreds of things that we might consider not to be natural that, in fact, have made life quite a lot better for many of us. Prior to modern medicine, more than one in 100 women died in childbirth. In wealthy, industrialised countries such as the UK today, it is more like one in 10,000. Before vaccinations were rolled out globally, whooping cough (pertussis) killed one out of every 10 children infected. After the global roll-out, deaths fell to a fraction \u2013 1/157, specifically \u2013 of what they had been before.\nThat's just medicine. Look around you right now, and you'll see a dozen more examples. It's may not be \"natural\" to wear glasses, refrigerate food, or turn on the heating in winter, for example \u2013 but for many of us, it's a better alternative than walking around near-blind, leaving meat to spoil or shivering in the cold.\nMuch of the food we eat does not come to us as nature presents it. We process and cook it. The harvesting, grinding and processing of grains helped to drive the transition of our species from being nomadic hunter gatherers into settled farmers capable of building sophisticated civilisations. So, too, did the way in which we cultivated and cross-bred crops \u2013 meaning that many of the nutritious foods we consider \"natural\" today, from the orange carrot to the modern banana, look (and taste) far different than their wild forebears.\nOf course, it would be wrong to suggest that human-made products don't also cause us problems, whether pollution from synthetic plastics to the use of guns and explosives. Nor does it mean that, in many cases, the more \"natural\" option is not better for us. But it does mean that we cannot assume the more \"natural\" option is better just because it's natural \u2013 despite a frequent tendency for people to believe the contrary. Carrots might be better for us than crisps, but so too is paracetamol versus arsenic.\nSome of these examples hint at one of the other main problems with the \"appeal to nature\" \u2013 how can you delineate what is, and what isn't, natural at all? Humans, after all, come from nature. So, if anything an animal or plant produces is \"natural\", why isn't anything that humans do? And what of those creations that are blends of what we'd traditionally consider natural and man-made \u2013 like vaccinations, which are derived from the parts of a (natural) virus or bacteria, and, when injected, help teach your immune system how to (naturally) fend off that same pathogen in the future?\n\"Like all truly interesting words, 'nature' is a mille-feuille of meanings,\" writes the science historian Lorraine Daston. It can mean almost anything, depending on the context. This slipperiness, of course, is exactly what makes it such clever language for marketing \u2013 and makes it so easy for us to fall for.\nThere's another problem, too: even if there were a clear-cut delineation between \"humans\" and \"nature\", we're often not very good at knowing what is actually synthetic, versus what is not.\nTake brushing our teeth. Is it natural to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste? What about to brush your teeth with a non-fluoride toothpaste?\nFor many of us, our instinct might be to say that brushing with fluoride is unnatural, while brushing with non-fluoride toothpaste is natural. But fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that can be found in soil, water and rocks, while one of its common replacements in \"natural\" toothpastes, nano-hydroxyapatite, is synthetic. And, of course, we'd need to consider that cleaning one's teeth, certainly with the items we use today, is far from natural; the closest primates get to brushing their teeth is \"flossing\" with whatever is on hand (like bird feathers). Even if we wanted to brush our teeth the way that our human ancestors did, we'd need to scrub our teeth with a twig, pig hairs or even porcupine quills.\nMeanwhile, if I told you that I had made a drink for you that was made up of 99% dihydrogen monoxide, would you recoil? This chemical name sounds pretty synthetic, after all, until you think about it.\nDihydrogen monoxide is, of course, two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. You might be more familiar to see it written in chemical shorthand: H2O. In other words, water.\nThe next time you see a product being marketed on the basis that it is natural \u2013 or see someone arguing against something because it is not \u2013 it is worth questioning what is really being meant. And, perhaps, questioning why it is that those behind the product or practice are leaning on the \"appeal to nature\" fallacy to persuade an audience of its merits \u2013 rather than simply laying out the logical argument for just why it is actually the better option.\n* Amanda Ruggeri is an award-winning science and features journalist.

        "article_text": "Jamal Musiala has signed a new contract that will keep him at Bayern Munich until at least 2030\n\"People go to the stadium because of Jamal Musiala. He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn \u00a320.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted.

Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.Even though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.Musiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030Published19 hours agoMoments of magic & the 'perfect representative'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Musiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four timesWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.But as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "article_text": "Marcel Duchamp\u2019s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart \u2013 and at its 17th-Century predecessor.\nThis year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history \u2013 a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.\nMore like this:\n- When the Parthenon had dazzling colours\n- The insect that painted Europe red\n- The subversive power of the pipe\nThe work in question is awkwardly proportioned \u2013 over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall \u2013 and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um\u2019, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m\u2019ennuies, or \u2018you bore me\u2019) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making \u2013 found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel \u2013 that he christened \u2018readymades\u2019.\nIn stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, \u201cDuchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.\u201d Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.\nAnyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these \u2018readymade\u2019 swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp\u2019s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp\u2019s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp\u2019s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues \u2013 a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades \u2013 a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp\u2019s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of \u2018A. Boogert\u2019 \u2013 a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert\u2019s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel\u2019s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author\u2019s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp\u2019s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert\u2019s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp\u2019s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life\u2019s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Ramon Diaz spent only six months of his near 30-year managing career working in Europe - at Oxford United\nTwenty years ago a Copa Libertadores-winning legend turned up to manage mid-table fourth tier side Oxford United.\nSix months later Ramon Diaz and the rest of his seven-man entourage were blocked from even entering the ground.\nIt seems unlikely anybody will ever join the former River Plate manager, who played for Argentina, Inter Milan, Monaco and others, in winning South America's top tournament - and the League Two manager of the month award.\nBBC Sport tell the story with help from former players Steve Basham, Chris Tardif and Lucas Cominelli, BBC Oxford editor Jerome Sale, and Jean Marc Goiran, the man who brokered the deal and acted as assistant manager, translator and unofficial chief executive.\nFitness coach Pablo Fernandez, translator Guilliano Iacoppi, boss Ramon Diaz, coach Horatio Rodriguez and assistant Jean Marc Goiran (pictured from left to right) were five of the seven-strong party\nIt was December 2004. \nOxford United, the 1986 League Cup winners, were in a slump, having dropped from the second tier to the fourth since 1999 - and were sliding down League Two when owner Firoz Kassam sacked Graham Rix.\nKassam, the club's unpopular owner, invited out-of-work manager Chris Turner to watch their 1-0 defeat by Swansea - and most people thought he was the new manager, including the Oxford Mail, external and some players.\nBut instead... \"It was quite bizarre,\" said former U's striker Basham. \"Five or six guys came in, in a line. They all stood in front of us and none of them spoke a word of English, apart from one translator.\"\nGoiran said \"all the players had wide-open eyes wondering 'who are these guys?'\".\nThose guys were Diaz, head coach Horacio Rodriguez, another coach Raul Marcovich, Goiran, fitness trainer Pablo Fernandez, doctor Rafael Giulietti and translator Giuilliano Iacoppi.\nBut wait, how did it come to this? It all starts in Monaco - where Kassam and Goiran lived and Diaz also had a home having played for the club.\nKassam approached a friend of a friend, Goiran, who has worked as a football agent and consultant, to help him find a manager and the Monegasque suggested Diaz - who had left River Plate in 2002.\nAt the time it was widely reported that Diaz was not being paid to be Oxford manager - and Kassam said he had \"promised him shares in the club in return for success\".\nBut Goiran, speaking 20 years on, says Kassam's company Firoka, but not the club, instead paid Diaz and Goiran consulting fees in Monaco.\nAnd the question many have asked - why did a manager with five Argentine titles and the Copa Libertadores come to League Two Oxford? \nGoiran says it was part of a project to get to the Premier League in five years - but after a bitter ending, Diaz, who is now Corinthians manager in Brazil, never worked in England or even Europe again.\n\"When they first came in, there were grand talks about redeveloping the stadium, putting a new stand behind the goal and taking us into the Premier League,\" said goalkeeper Tardif.\nBack in 2004 there was less foreign involvement in the lower leagues in England, so it was an even big culture shock then than it is now.\nBut many of the players bought into the new training ideas, although some struggled to adapt.\n\"They brought something very new and very fresh to Oxford United at that time,\" said Basham, who played for the club between 2002 and 2007.\n\"It was way before its time. They came in with ideas and the philosophy that probably hit the English game two, three, four years later, certainly in the lower leagues.\"\nRodriguez would be hands-on - with Diaz overseeing things. To some around the club Rodriguez was seen as the traditional boss of the team with Diaz almost a director of football.\nDiaz and his coaches only spoke broken English, so had to communicate via their translator.\nBut Goiran, who was involved on the training pitch too, says Diaz was the manager and had the final say in everything. \nBasham said: \"He [Diaz] would come in amongst the team as we were laid out in our shape and he would take us through with movements. Very different, but it worked. \n\"He'd physically move you, he would then have you alongside him and he'd make the runs and you would make those runs with him.\"\nGoiran said: \"It was a very nice atmosphere. It was a great adventure. We changed the way they trained, the mentality. We taught them they are football players.\"\nThey were popular figures off the pitch too.\nBBC Oxford's Sale said: \"Ramon and his staff were imposing and impressive, but also gentle and friendly. \n\"He once asked me for $100,000 for interviews. I said the BBC wouldn't stretch that far. He said just to bring him a decent coffee next time then.\"\nRamon Diaz and his entourage were popular with the Oxford fans\nIt all started so well. They had been brought in to help the club avoid relegation but four wins and two draws in January got them dreaming of the play-offs - and Diaz was named League Two manager of the month.\nRemarkably it would take over 17 years for another Oxford manager to win an EFL award like that again - Liam Manning in September 2023.\n\"There was an immediate buzz around the ground,\" said BBC commentator Sale. \"The football went up a notch and the fun came back.\"\nDiaz and co had brought in a proper attacking style of football. Fitness and pressing were a big part of it too.\n\"We changed completely the way they play and they started to win,\" said Goiran.\n\"When a player starts to win they have pleasure, the mentality is better, they have confidence.\"\nBasham said: \"They were very much wanting to play football, which suited most of the team. \n\"I love getting the football down, love playing football, love linking play up and working to a strategy. So it was a bit different, certainly from the Ian Atkins [pragmatic lower-league manager who left Oxford in April 2004] times, which I enjoyed too.\"\nOne of Diaz's innovative strategies was leaving three quick players up the pitch while they were defending a corner in case of a counter-attacking possibility.\n\"It was more of a Pep philosophy in terms of total football even at that level,\" said Tardif, referring to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.\n\"It\u2019s great when it's all world-class players but in the lower leagues it's not always possible. They tried to enforce football at its purest form. We tried it. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it failed.\"\nLucas Cominelli was offered a new deal to stay with Oxford, but new manager Brian Talbot did not want any of the Argentines \nThe new management team wanted to freshen up the squad and brought in a host of trialists - some days about half of the people training were trialists.\nOut of those came a few South American signings - midfielder Lucas Cominelli, winger Juan Pablo Raponi and Uruguayan defender Mateo Corbo. Diaz's sons Emiliano and Michael - who was young and never played for the first team - also joined.\nResults were mixed.\nCominelli played 16 times, scoring a long-range effort against Grimsby, and was seen as one of the successes.\n\"Oxford were fantastic,\" said Cominelli, who had once been on the books of Newcastle without making a first-team appearance.\n\"It was really good. I had a good experience, a good memory of it from the fans, the city, the club.\"\nFull-back Corbo remains a cult hero at the club after eight yellow cards and a red card in 13 games.\nRaponi, who had played for River Plate, was too lightweight for League Two but played 10 times.\nEmiliano Diaz, who played seven times, is often mentioned in discussions about Oxford's worst ever players.\nThat was just one of many times he worked with his dad - having played under Ramon at River Plate and been his assistant manager at over 10 teams since retiring.\nCominelli added there were never issues between the England and South American players.\n\"The team-mates were really OK,\" he said. \"It was really welcome. They helped and everything. We had a good dressing room.\"\nBasham added: \"Some [were] good, some not so good. Some fitted in really well. A couple were superb, really worked hard, good on the ball, really good additions to the side. \n\"And then you had one or two that it didn't quite work out for them.\n\"Raponi was very quick, he made an impact at times, but the physical side of the game sometimes was a bit too much for him.\"\nThe falling out between Firoz Kassam (left) and Ramon Diaz (right) over the ambitions of the club proved to be the downfall of the experiment\nAfter the good run in January, though, Oxford's form took a dip, losing four of the next five games.\nAnd things were unravelling off the pitch too.\nDiaz and Kassam fell out over a difference of opinion in the ambition of the club - and over Diaz not speaking English.\nThe manager, plus some of his coaches, missed a few games for work permit or passport reasons.\nBasham said it just \"fizzled out\" as the club finished 15th - nowhere near the top or bottom.\n\"It's almost surreal looking back,\" said Tardif. \"It was difficult for them coming in our level. They weren't quite ready for having to do the basics over and over again. \n\"I really liked them as people. Do I think it was the right match? Probably not.\"\nGoiran was in discussions with Kassam about how to structure the club's marketing and finding investment. \n\"There were a lot of things to do because the club was not professional for me,\" he said. \"I spent about 12 hours per day minimum working on that and we made a lot of progress. \n\"I was more like a chief executive than other things - but I was still close on the training ground.\n\"The relationship between Ramon and Firoz was difficult. They discussed the future and financial things. Ramon didn't feel that Firoz would like to grow [the club].\"\nBasham said: \"I think they had really big plans for Oxford United. They were all pushing in the right direction.\n\"I think they all thought they were close to some sort of deal with Kassam and for whatever reason it all just ended up... yeah, there was a big fallout, which was a real shame.\"\nOnce it was obvious Diaz would probably leave the club, Goiran tried to find another manager for the project.\nDiaz resigned as manager and he and his sons flew home before the penultimate game of the season. \n\"His decision to leave was unexpected and I am disappointed,\" said Kassam at the time - who added keeping Diaz would have cost the club \u00a31m.\nThe Oxford Mail even reported that Rodriguez was set to become the new manager., external\nBut suddenly the entire experiment was over. Before the final game of the season, at home to Chester, Kassam got rid of Diaz's entire backroom staff and appointed Brian Talbot.\nGoiran was offered the chance to stay but said \"I brought these people in and if they're going out I have to go with them\". \n\"Everything was so OK except the relationship between Firoz and Ramon. We had a lot of good plans for the future, a lot of ideas regarding investors to change the club and grow. But it was a bad ending,\" Goiran said.\nAnd it got very messy as Diaz and his coaches bought tickets to watch the final game of the season against Chester and to say thank you to the Oxford supporters.\nBut Kassam ordered his stewards to refuse them entry and an argument broke out 10 minutes into the game - with fans leaving their seats to ask they be let in.\n\"We had to take the car and left everything there. It was not a good ending,\" said Goiran.\n\"I was very sad to leave the club. It was a fantastic time. I did it with my heart plus everything. The feeling I have with the fans was 'wow'. \n\"It's my club forever - I\u2019m always looking at their results. It's a love story between me and Oxford.\"\nThat was the end of all the South American players too.\nCominelli said: \"The club had offered me a new contract. I wanted to stay but the new coach who came [Talbot], he decided all the foreign players [should be] gone.\"\nKassam and Diaz, through his current club Corinthians, did not respond to requests to speak to the BBC for this feature.\nThe following season Talbot was sacked, Kassam sold the club and Oxford were relegated to the Conference.",

        "article_text": "From raw eggs to protein shakes, those hoping to expand their brawn are often encouraged to ingest vast quantities of protein. But how much is really necessary and what's the best way to consume it?\nSophia\u00a0Moulson, 21, a fitness influencer based in West Sussex, began taking fitness seriously at the age of 19, after struggling with being overweight.\n\"I often turned to food as a source of comfort, which ultimately left me in a cycle of negative self-image and low confidence. One day, I realised that I needed to take control \u2013 not just for my physical health but for my mental wellbeing too,\" says Moulson.\nInitially, she joined the gym with the sole intention of losing weight. But over time, she fell in love with the process of building up a healthy amount of muscle too. \"I discovered how empowering it felt to grow stronger, and each small strength milestone motivated me to keep pushing forward,\" she says.\nAn integral part of Moulson's progress was research on nutrition. That's when she learned about the importance of protein for building muscle. However, as a vegetarian, Moulson initially felt that she was struggling to get enough protein through just her diet, so she turned to protein powders. \"While it was possible for me to meet my needs through a well-balanced diet, it often required time and careful planning. Protein powders offered a convenient solution, especially with my busy lifestyle,\" she says.\nWhile in the past, bodybuilders were notorious for consuming vast quantities of steak and drinking raw eggs, today, protein powders and tailored diets are big business. But do we really need so much protein to grow stronger? And what is the best way to consume it?\nLinea Patel, a\u00a0Sports Dietitian at the company Pure Sports Medicine in London, explains that proteins have many roles in the human body. As they are digested, the proteins in food are broken down into amino acids \u2013 building blocks that can be rearranged to form any protein that the body needs. Haemoglobin, enzymes, muscles, the keratin in our skin and hair \u2013 there are more than 20,000 proteins in the human body, performing a wide range of functions.\nHowever, the amount that each person needs can vary greatly, depending on their age, body composition and lifestyle.\n\"In the UK, the government guidelines say that the general baseline for sedentary adults is that they should consume 0.8 or 0.75g\u00a0[around 0.03oz] of protein per kg of their own body weight,\" says Patel. \"So, for example, if somebody weighed 70kg [154lb], then you just multiply that by 0.8 and you'll get 56g [around 2oz] of protein a day.\"\nMost people get more than that amount from their normal diets. In the US, the average American consumes around 14-16% of their total calories as protein. However, if you're more active, your protein requirements may exceed 1g per kg each day. The amount of protein you need also depends on factors such as your age, because people tend to lose muscle mass as they get older \u2013 consuming more protein can help us to hold onto more muscle. Post-menopausal women also have higher protein requirements.\n\"What I see in my clinical practice, particularly because I work with women in the menopause or high performing individuals [sportspeople], is that perhaps that they're not eating enough protein for their level of activity or to maintain [appropriate] muscle mass for their stage of life,\" says Patel. One size doesn't fit all, she explains.\nFor individuals engaging in regular high-intensity resistance training or athletes and powerlifters or body builders, research has found that the daily\u00a0protein\u00a0requirement is approximately 1.6-2.2g (0.06-0.08oz) per kg of body weight to maximise muscle\u00a0protein\u00a0synthesis.\u00a0\nMany medical professionals recommend that people acquire the protein they need from their diets, wherever possible. For vegans, this can involve consuming more nuts, seeds and soya-based products, as well as pulses such as beans and lentils. For vegetarians, eggs, yoghurt and certain types of cheese can be added, while omnivores may also want to increase their consumption of meat and seafood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor many, consuming enough protein involves experimenting with different foods. However, not everyone has the time or money to acquire adequate protein through their diet alone.\u00a0\n\"Even though, theoretically, one can meet this target through a balanced diet rich in\u00a0protein-dense foods like lean meats, eggs, dairy and legumes, for many this may not be easy without supplementation,\" says Cyriac Abby Philips, a liver specialist at the Rajagiri Hospital in Kerala, India.\nLauren Manaker a dietician based in Charleston, South Carolina in the US, adds that protein powders \"do provide a convenient and portable option, especially for individuals with busy lifestyles or limited access to whole food sources\".\nGlobally, the protein powder market has been valued at $4.4bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2021, and is expected to grow to $19.3bn (\u00a315.6bn) by 2030. There are many formulations \u2013 both animal and plant-based, in the form of shakes, or added to nutrition bars, yoghurts and ready meals.\n\"When I incorporated plant-based protein powders into my diet, it became much easier to hit my protein goals\u2026 Over time, I experimented with different options and found that lean protein powders or whey protein worked best for me, as they are low in calories but high in protein,\" says Moulson.\nHowever, protein powders can come with risks, and there's some evidence in rats that they could lead to liver damage in those who are not exercising. There have also been rare cases of toxicity to the liver from whey and soy-based protein powders in humans.\u00a0\nProtein powders can also be misleadingly labelled and may contain harmful contaminants. For a recent study, Philips and colleagues from India and the US analysed protein powders sold in India. The team found that many powders contained more or less protein than they were marketed as having \u2013 leading to concerns about \"protein-spiking\" \u2013 as well as contaminants including heavy metals, fungal toxins and herbal extracts that may be toxic to the liver.\nToxins in protein powders may be more widespread than we think.\nIn 2018, a nonprofit group called the Clean Label Project, based in Broomfield, Colorado, released a report about toxins in popular brands of protein powders in the US. Researchers screened 134 products for 130 types of toxins and found that many protein powders contained heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury), bisphenol-A (or BPA, which is used to manufacture plastic), pesticides, or other contaminants with links to cancer and other health conditions. Some toxins were present in significant quantities.\nFor example, one protein powder contained 25 times the allowed limit of BPA in the US. The pesticides and chemicals came from agricultural residue and from the packaging of these powders, researchers observed. Interestingly, one certified \"organic\" product had twice the contaminants of non-certified ones. Plant-based protein powders were the most contaminated, while egg and whey-based powders were found to be the cleanest.\nBecause protein powders are considered dietary supplements and not pharmaceuticals, regulation from governing authorities tends to be more relaxed \u2013 in the US and the UK, they're considered food. This has led to concerns that they are not being regulated strictly enough.\nWhen increasing body muscle, it's not impossible to get your protein requirements through the foods you eat, but it can take considerable time and planning. The key to achieving your daily requirements is to eat protein at every meal and to plan your meals around a principal source of protein, says Patel.\n\"We're looking to aim for at least 20-30g (0.7-1.1oz) of protein per meal,\" says Patel. That would be the equivalent to a couple of eggs or some Greek yogurt with nuts sprinkled on top, or a chicken breast, or a piece of tofu that is the size of your fist.\n\"So, for example, you might have to have two eggs on sourdough toast with some avocado with some seeds sprinkled on top \u2013 with the eggs being the principal protein, the food source with the highest protein content,\" says Patel. \"In a meal that consists of beans or lentils with some rice, the lentils would be the principal protein.\"\nIf you decide to take a protein supplement instead or as well as altering your diet, there are a few simple rules for choosing one that is least likely to contain harmful substances. First of all, prioritise high-quality\u00a0proteins with minimal additives, says Philips.\n\"One must definitely avoid 'blended'\u00a0proteins\u00a0with herbal components as the risk of adulteration, contamination inclusive of the presence of heavy metals and fungal toxins are higher in these types of\u00a0protein\u00a0supplements,\" he says.\nManaker also advises that consumers do their research, particularly to avoid unnecessary ingredients. \"Look for protein powders that contain high-quality ingredients and have minimal additives, fillers or artificial sweeteners. Opt for brands that prioritise transparency and provide detailed information about the sourcing and processing of their ingredients,\" Manaker says.\nManaker also recommends considering the source of the protein in the powder. It's important to check labels to see if it's from whey, casein, soya, plant or animal-based proteins, she says. \"Choose a protein source that aligns with your dietary preferences, allergies or sensitivities.\"\nIf you're taking a protein supplement or powder, timing can play a role in optimising its benefits, says Manaker. \"Consuming protein within 30 minutes to an hour after a workout is often recommended to take advantage of the body's heightened ability to absorb and utilise nutrients during this time,\" she says.\nAnd the way you take protein powders matters. While protein supplements can be beneficial, it's crucial to avoid relying solely on them as a source of nutrition. \"Whole, nutrient-dense foods should form the foundation of your diet, and supplements should only complement a well-balanced eating plan. Avoid the temptation to replace meals entirely with protein powders, as this can lead to an inadequate intake of other essential nutrients,\" says Manaker.\nWith widespread access to protein powders and protein-rich foods today, some people do consume more protein than what they probably need, says Manaker. For example, while the average adult needs around 45-56 grams (1.6-2 ounces) of protein per day, in the UK people tend to consume around 75-100 grams (2.6-3.5 ounces). \u00a0While it is essential for muscle building and overall health, consuming an excessive amount of protein intake can have potential risks.\n\"High protein intake over a prolonged period can put strain on the kidneys,\" says Manaker. \"Individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions should be particularly cautious.\"\nFurthermore, a sudden increase in protein intake, especially from protein powders, can sometimes lead to digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas and constipation. \"Keep an eye on the way your body reacts, even as you tweak your protein [intake],\" says Patel.\nKeep in mind that it's easy to go overboard with protein powders. \"As a general guideline, I wouldn't recommend that people using protein powders exceed 80g [2.8oz] a day,\" says Patel. \"Even 80g of protein from protein powder is excessive for most people. It's going to completely displace whole foods that provide vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that we need. So in general, for most of my clients I tell them to stick with 20 to 40g [0.7-1.4oz] of protein powder per day.\"\nIn particular, problems tend to arise when one's diet is laser-focused only on proteins, says Patel. Micronutrients from fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates, which are also vital for a balanced diet, can end up being neglected.\nIn order to optimise your diet while weight training, ensure that you're including quality carbohydrates and prioritise micro-nutrients like Vitamin D, magnesium, iron and Omega 3 fats. \"They're all essential for optimum muscle contraction, bone health and energy. Eat fruits, vegetables and include oily fish in your diet at least once a week,\" says Patel.\nGetting enough protein is key to growing stronger muscles, but it's only one of the pillars of wellness, says Patel. \"The other pillars are physical activity, getting the training right and sleeping well,\" she says.\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "As travellers flock to the English countryside to celebrate the renowned novelist, we asked experts to weigh in on the best Austen-themed festivals, reenactments and balls of the year.\nWith bonnets and boarding passes ready, a brigade of Jane Austen fans from around the world is preparing to bombard Britain, eager to celebrate one of English literature's greatest writers throughout 2025 on her 250th birthday.\nFrom the dashing John Willoughby in Sense and Sensibility to the spirited Emma Woodhouse in the eponymous Emma, Austen's characters have enchanted generations of readers, inspiring yearly pilgrimages to her home county of Hampshire and beyond to trace her footsteps. This year, these journeys take on a celebratory air as travellers flock to the English countryside for literary festivals, reenactments and Regency balls designed to pay tribute to the author.\nHere are the year's most ostentatious events, according to Austen experts \u2013 the ones promising fans an unforgettable birthday bash for a writer who presciently wrote, \"One cannot have too large a party.\"\nAlthough her vivid portrayals of English life now epitomise the extravagance of the Georgian era, Austen's own story began modestly. She was born on 16 December 1775, in the village of Steventon, in Hampshire, England, the seventh child and youngest daughter of clergyman George Austen and his wife Cassandra.\n\"It must have been a bustling household, with the large Austen family and the boys her father tutored,\" said Janet Todd, one of Britain's leading Austen scholars. Although the rectory where the Austens lived was demolished in 1824, St Nicholas Church, where they worshipped, still stands. A dedicated team of volunteers is working to ensure every visit to the historic chapel is memorable.\nNot at all bowing to the idea of being the country cousin to the author's more well-known former towns, like Bath and Chawton, Steventon has organised lively events for June, July and December. Visitors can attend the Jane Austen's Words and Music Chamber concert on 8 June\u00a0 at her family's chapel or join a country fair on 6 June held in the same pump field where the Austen's parsonage home once stood. Then, in remembrance, the church will hold a special Thanksgiving Service for Austen on her birthday on 16 December.\nIn Austen's England, balls were pivotal to social life and courtship among the middle and upper classes. For Zack Pinsent, a 29-year-old tailor known for exclusively wearing Regency-era attire, attending a ball is the ultimate tribute to Austen. This year's calendar is packed with options, from a Regency Week Ball in Alton this June to a Yuletide Birthday Ball in Bath come December. However, Pinsent recommends the Brighton Royal Grand Pavilion Ball on January 25, which he is organising and has already drawn attendees from 16 countries.\n\"Anyone can attend, as long as they have the right outfit,\" said Pinsent, who has secured the Royal Pavilion for the eponymous Regency-inspired event.\nBrighton's Royal Pavilion, built by George IV, Austen's contemporary and admirer, hosted extravagant balls in its heyday. Though there's no evidence Austen ever visited, Pinsent speculates she may have, given Brighton's influence on her imagination. The seaside town even earned a mention in Pride and Prejudice, when Austen wrote of Lydia Bennet: \"At Brighton, she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\"\nAusten set two of her novels, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, in Bath, but her feelings about the resort town remain debated. Her famously dramatic reaction to her family's move there from Steventon \u2013 she allegedly fainted \u2013 hints at reluctance. Still, during her years in Bath (1801-1806), its vibrant social scene, from galas at Sydney Gardens to events at the Assembly Rooms, inspired her work. However, personal tragedy, including her father's death during this time, likely influenced her perception of the city.\n\"The party line is, we don't really know how she felt about Bath,\" said Georgia Delve, director of the Jane Austen Centre Festival (held 12-21 September in Bath). \"But I think in terms of her storyline and the characters, you walk around the city, and it's all written in the stone: you get Bennett Street, you've got Bartlett Street, you've got the Assembly Rooms, you've got the Royal Crescent, you've got the Paragon, you know, great Pulteney Street. All these places come up in her letters and novels.\"\nBath's enduring love for Austen is clear, exemplified by its Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of people in Regency costumes. This year's Austen Festival begins with a grand promenade, drawing fans worldwide.\nBeyond the festival, the Jane Austen Centre is hosting two summer Regency balls, including a Persuasion-themed Nautical Ball on 31 May and a unique Sanditon-inspired event based on Austen's unfinished novel of the same name on 28 June. The event will include dance workshops to master waltzes and cotillions.\nThe port city of Southampton played a role in Austen's life on three occasions \u2013 an often-overlooked fact that the town is hoping to rectify this year. She briefly attended boarding school there, celebrated her 18th birthday at the city's historic Dolphin Hotel, and later stayed there with her brother after departing Bath. To honour the city's deep ties, Southampton plans to display her travel writing desk now through \u200b\u200b23 February at God's House Tower, on loan from the British Library as part of the exhibit In Training for a Heroine. The portable mahogany desk was a gift from her father, and on it, she wrote what she referred to as \"My own darling child,\" the first draft of Pride and Prejudice. Tickets are free, but visitors must reserve a time to see the installation.\nAccording to Todd, much of Austen's enduring appeal lies in her connection to a romanticised England. Hampshire, where she lived, wrote, and set many of her novels, preserved its charm by avoiding industrialisation. This timeless quality makes a visit to the author's former home in Chawton, now called Jane Austen's House, a uniquely transportive experience. After her father's death left Jane, her sister and their mother nearly penniless, with only \u00a3210 a year, according to Todd, Jane's brother Edward eventually moved them into his cottage in 1809. It was here, in this idyllic setting, that Jane refined her six novels.\nMore like this:\n \u2022 What Jane Austen can teach us about resilience\n \u2022 Britain's greatest natural wonders to explore in the wintertime\n \u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\nTo celebrate the writer's 250th birthday, the Jane Austen House hosts a Pride and Prejudice Festival from 23-28 January, featuring Austenmania, a year-long exhibit dedicated to her posthumous cinematic legacy. The site has also launched a permanent exhibition, Jane Austen and the Art of Writing, showcasing her creative process and first editions of her works. \"It's quite moving to be in there with them,\" said 15-year docent Janie McShane of the priceless tomes. For many visitors, that's the real allure, to see how Austen lived, \"to tread,\" McShane said, \"where she tread\".\nAusten was an enthusiastic walker. In a world where a woman's life was nearly always spent supervised or in the company of family and friends, taking a stroll likely meant freedom and escape. \"Austen's characters walk to be themselves and to change,\" writes Rachel Cohen in Austen Years: A Memoir in Five Novels. \nPat Lerew, chair of the Jane Austen Alton Group, says her village will give visitors the same opportunity. Alton is reasonably short stroll from Austen's House. \"We know Jane and her sister walked into Alton two or three times a week to shop or visit with friends,\" Lerew said. \"She would also pick up the coach here to go to London.\" Similarly, the 10-day Jane Austen Regency Week (20-29 June) will include a Regency Day with stalls and entertainment guests can peruse, followed by a ribbon cutting on a new public Jane Austen Garden.\nThe final chapter of Jane's life was tragic. At 41, she fell ill with a mysterious condition that modern experts have speculated may have been Addison's disease or Hodgkin lymphoma. Her deteriorating condition required a move from Chawton cottage to Winchester to seek specialised care. Jane and her sister Cassandra took up residence at No. 8 College Street, a property now owned by Winchester College, a historic boarding school attended by eight of Austen's nephews. This summer, for the first time ever, the school is opening the apartments to the public.\n\"The apartment remains strikingly similar to how it was in Austen's time,\" said Richard Foster, the Fellows' Librarian and Keeper of Collections at the college, who has played a key role in organising the opening. \"Austen describes a neat little drawing room with a bay window overlooking the headmaster's garden, and those features are still intact.\" It was in this space that Austen penned her final poem, and from the same bay window, Cassandra watched her sister's funeral procession \u2013 restricted by 19th-Century customs that barred women from attending.\nTickets for this limited-time opening are available online. Visitors can also honour Austen at her final resting place in the north nave of Winchester Cathedral. Her simple gravestone, devoid of any mention of her literary brilliance, seems almost ironic \u2013 a fact Austen herself might have found darkly amusing. The modest epitaph only nods to the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", a description she might have skewered with her signature wit. After all, as she once wrote, \"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

        "article_text": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993.\nIt sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993.\nBut the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell.\nEven today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book \u2013 based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible \u2013 demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters \u2013 like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 \u2013 or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.\u00a0\nThis space mirror idea was taken up again by German physicists during World War Two. At the Nazi weapons research centre in Hillersleben, scientists worked on a design to build a terrifying reflective orbiting weapon called the Sonnengewehr or Sun gun in German. In 1945, Time magazine reported that captured German scientists had told US Army interrogators that the Sonnengewehr was meant to act as a death ray, refocusing light from the Sun to set fire to cities or boil away water in lakes. Despite facing evident scepticism from their US interrogators as they handed over their technical drawings, the German scientists had believed that their Sun gun could be operational in 50 years, the chief of Allied technical intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel John Keck, told reporters at the time.\nIn the 1970s, another German\u2010born rocket engineer, Dr Krafft Ehricke, again began looking at the concept. Ehricke had been a member of Germany's V-2 rocket team during World War Two. At the end of the war, he surrendered to the US and was recruited as part of Operation Paperclip, wherein 1,600 scientists, engineers and technicians deemed to be valuable were shielded from prosecution, spirited out of Germany, and allowed to continue their work in the US.\nEhricke became part of the US space programme, and in the 1970s he returned to the idea of building a mirror in space. In 1978, he wrote a paper detailing how giant orbiting mirrors could illuminate the night sky, enabling farmers to plant or harvest 24 hours a day, or could be used to deflect sunlight down onto solar panels on Earth to be converted into electricity on demand. He called this idea Power Soletta. Ehricke, a space-travel enthusiast from childhood and a long-time proponent of colonising other planets, died in 1984 without seeing Power Soletta come to fruition. But he would get his long-desired space flight posthumously when his cremated remains were launched into Earth's orbit in 1997 along with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s counterculture psychologist Timothy Leary.\u00a0\nThroughout the 1980s, Nasa looked repeatedly at the concept of generating solar power by harnessing sunlight with an orbiting mirror system called Solares, but despite government interest the project was never able to secure funding. However, in Russia the idea of solar mirrors took root.\u00a0\nAt the time, a Russian scientist called Vladimir Syromiatnikov was investigating whether large reflective solar sails could be attached to a spaceship. Syromiatnikov was a pioneering figure in space engineering breakthroughs. He had worked on the Vostok rocket, the world's first crewed spacecraft that took Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. He also developed an ingenious spacecraft docking mechanism, the Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS). This was used in July 1975 in the Apollo-Soyuz test project, the first joint space flight by the then Cold War enemies, the US and the USSR, in which a US module carrying three astronauts successfully linked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule carrying two cosmonauts in orbit. His APAS was later used to enable US shuttles to dock with the Russian Mir space station and is still used for docking at the International Space Station.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov thought that if solar sails were attached to a spacecraft they could use the Sun in a similar fashion to how ships' sails use the wind. If the reflective sails could be angled correctly then photons, particles of energy coming from the Sun, could bounce off their mirror-like surfaces and gently propel the craft forward through space without it having to burn any fuel.\nHowever, in Russia during the post-Soviet era, getting funding for ambitious space projects like Syromiatnikov's was difficult unless they could demonstrate a clear economic goal. So Syromiatnikov decided to repurpose his concept. He thought that reflective solar sails on a spacecraft in orbit could act as a mirror, with the craft's thrusters used to angle the sails and keep them in sync with the Sun's position. That mirror could be used to beam down light on Russia's polar regions where the days are extremely short in the winter, illuminating areas shrouded in darkness. The extra sunlight would extend the working day and increase the productivity of farmlands. He also envisioned that the bonus sunshine could reduce the cost of electrical lighting and heating for the area and add to the wellbeing of people in the region.\nThis turned out to be an idea that the government could get behind. And so, funded by the Space Regatta Consortium, a group of Russian state-owned companies and agencies, and overseen by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Syromiatnikov began work on making the Znamya space mirror a reality.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nThe first prototype built, Znamya 1, wasn't actually sent into space, but remained on Earth to be tested so that Syromiatnikov could iron out any technical problems. Znamya 2 was to be the first to go into orbit. Its mirror was made from thin sheets of aluminised Mylar, a lightweight highly reflective material which was thought to be sturdy enough to survive the hostile conditions in space. It was designed to unfurl in eight sections into a circular shape from a rotating central drum mechanism and stay in that form through centrifugal force.\u00a0\n\"During the flight the reflector is wrapped tightly around the body of the craft, and to open it the craft will have to spin round rapidly forcing it out like an umbrella,\" explained the BBC's Bellingham to TV viewers in 1992. \"The trick is that at this height the 20m-wide reflector will then be able to capture the Sun's rays which normally bypass the Earth and reflect them down onto the dark side of our planet.\"\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov's plan was to have multiple Znamya launches, each one with a larger mirror that burned up as it came back to Earth. Russian engineers would be able to study how Znamya's thin reflective sheets performed when they were activated in space, and perfect his design. This would lead to the launch of a permanent Znamya with a massive 200m-wide reflector that would stay in orbit around Earth.\nThe ultimate ambition was to have a grid of up to 36 of these giant mirrors in space with the ability to pivot, enabling them to keep the reflected light targeted on the same spot. A single reflector could be used to light up a peculiar area. \"On a clear night the space reflector could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium, bringing some light relief to the long winter nights,\" said Bellingham. Or multiple reflectors could focus light together to bring greater brightness or illuminate a bigger region. It was estimated that the combined space mirror grid would be able to reflect light 50 times brighter than the Moon and illuminate an area up to 50 miles (90km) across.\u00a0\nOn 27 October 1992, the project was ready, and the crewless spacecraft Progress M-15 launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Znamya 2 on board. After the cargo supply craft docked with the Russian space station, Mir's crew fitted the drum containing the folded reflective solar sheets into position on the Progress spacecraft. Znamya 2 was due to be trialled towards the end of the year, but its deployment was delayed while the Mir crew conducted tests for other upcoming missions. On 4 February 1993, they were finally ready to put the plan into action.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Training for the Apollo 11 Moon mission\n\u2022\u00a0Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\n\u2022\u00a0The 'alien invasion' that scared the US\nThe autonomous Progress spacecraft undocked, and once it was at a distance of some 150m from Mir, it began to rotate, unfurling the mirror like a giant fan which caught the Sun's rays and beamed them back down to Earth.\nThe reflected light had a luminosity roughly equivalent to a full moon and created a spotlight about three miles (5km) wide on Earth. At a speed of five miles per second (8km per second) the patch of light raced from southern France through Switzerland, Germany, and Poland across to western Russia. The crew on Mir were able to see a faint beam of light as it swept through Europe, and despite much of the continent being covered in clouds that day, some people on the ground reported witnessing it as a flash of light. After a few hours, the space mirror deorbited and burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere over Canada.\u00a0\nBack in Russia, the Znamya 2 experiment was hailed as a technical success \u2013 but it also demonstrated some significant challenges for the project. Znamya 2's reflected light had proved much less intense than expected and too diffused to provide practical illumination for a large area on Earth. It had also been tricky maintaining Znamya 2's stability in orbital conditions, and its spotlight's rapid journey across the Earth's surface and fleeting visibility made its real-world uses seem limited.\nBut the mission had provided encouraging results and valuable insights, so Syromiatnikov ploughed ahead with his planned follow-up experiment, Znamya 2.5. This time it would have a 25m mirror, reflecting a luminosity of between five and 10 full moons, and shining a spot of light that would cover an area five miles (8km) wide. The intention was to control the direction of the reflected light beam so it could target a spot on the Earth for several minutes at a time as Znamya 2.5 revolved around the Earth. Two cities in North America were picked to be illuminated by the mirror's sun ray during what would be a 24-hour experiment, as well as several in Europe.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov was heartened by the progress his team was making, and the launch was planned for October 1998. \"We are pioneers in the field,\" he told The Moscow Times in July 1998. \"If the experiment goes according to plan, we propose to send dozens more craft into space in the future on a permanent basis.\"\nBut even before Znamya 2.5 left the ground, Russian space officials began receiving complaints. Astronomers were worried that the mirror would pollute the night sky with light, dazzling their telescopes and obscure their view of the stars. The Royal Astronomical Society went so far as to protest to the Director General of the Space Regatta Consortium about the experiment. Ecologists also raised concerns that its artificial light might cause confusion to animals and plants, disrupting wildlife and nature cycles.\u00a0\nDespite these misgivings, there was considerable global attention and excitement about the Znamya project's potential implications. \"Think what it will mean for the future of mankind,\" Syromiatnikov told The Moscow Times. \"No more electricity bills, no more long, dark winters. This is a serious breakthrough for technology.\" And so, the Znamya 2.5's launch went ahead as planned, and with Mission Control monitoring from Moscow, the larger space mirror was primed to deploy on 5 February 1999.\nAt first everything went as planned; the folded-up space mirror had been attached to Progress, which undocked from Mir without a hitch. It smoothly moved into position away from the space station, Progress's thrusters were commanded to fire, and it began to spin to unfurl the foil mirror. Unfortunately, at the same time an extra command was sent to Progress by mistake, telling it to deploy the antenna it used to communicate for docking manoeuvres. As the antenna extended, Znamya 2.5's thin reflective sheets immediately became caught up in it.\nMission Control in Moscow watched in dismay as footage of the tangled mirror beamed back from Mir, and frantic commands were sent to retract the antenna. But by this time, several yards of foil had already become wrapped around it, tearing the mirror in several places. Realising that they were in danger of ripping the reflective sheets further, the commands were paused. A second desperate attempt to spin the mirror free was tried an hour later, but to no avail.\nCrestfallen, Mission Control recognised that the Znamya 2.5's torn and crumpled mirror could never be unfurled, and allowed it to fall to Earth still attached to the Progress craft. It burnt up in the atmosphere the following day over the Pacific Ocean. \"The mood here is very depressed,\" Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for the Mission Control in Moscow, told the BBC at the time.\u00a0\nIts fall to Earth did not just destroy Znamya 2.5 but the future of Syromiatnikov's idealistic space mirror project. His planned Znamya 3 with a 70m reflecting surface, which was meant to launch in 2001, could not secure funding and was never built. Syromiatnikov, widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding space engineers of his generation, died in 2006, his dreams of solar sails and mirrors unrealised.\u00a0\n\"The failure was especially painful because of the huge worldwide interest that the experiment aroused,\" Lyndin told the BBC in 1999. \"We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programmes \u2013 to do something first and boast about it only after.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

And so, the Znamya 2.5's launch went ahead as planned, and with Mission Control monitoring from Moscow, the larger space mirror was primed to deploy on 5 February 1999.At first everything went as planned; the folded-up space mirror had been attached to Progress, which undocked from Mir without a hitch. He thought that reflective solar sails on a spacecraft in orbit could act as a mirror, with the craft's thrusters used to angle the sails and keep them in sync with the Sun's position.",

        "article_text": "The world's only museum dedicated to the history and culture of the Gulf of Mexico may be in hot water following Trump's decision to change the name of the planet's largest gulf.\nLast year Karen Poth decided it was time to rename the museum she runs in Mobile, Alabama, to better reflect its unique status.\nTo do so, she first had to line up support from elected officials and her board of directors before raising money for the project. Next, she needed to update the museum's website, logo and printed materials. Then in April 2024, she finally unveiled the new name in letters stretching 50ft across the eight-storey building: the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, the only museum in the world dedicated to the history, folklore and culture of the largest gulf on Earth.\nSo, imagine her response when US President Donald Trump recently announced that he planned to rename the body of water to the south of the US from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. \"My personality is to laugh,\" Poth said. \"Or else you cry.\"\nThe name change, which was signed into law on 20 January and is part of a broader Trump effort to \"honour American greatness\", has created an international firestorm. After Google recently announced that it would follow Trump's executive order and also change the Gulf's name on Google Maps in the US, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argued that Trump alone cannot legally do that.\nPoth says she's not taking sides, but admits she's overwhelmed at the thought of what would happen if the museum had to change every reference to the Gulf of America. \"It would be a complete redo of the entire museum. If you think about it, every audio, every video, every digital, every sign\u2026 that will be very, very expensive.\"\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nSince the museum is owned by the city of Mobile, Poth said she will ultimately follow city officials' leads. \"If I need to change the name of the museum, we'll be up there changing the signage on the top of the building.\" The museum still carries debt from its opening a decade ago, and Poth estimates that changing the museum's name in 2024 cost nearly $100,000.\nBut as visitors to the museum learn, the Gulf has actually had many names throughout its multi-cultural history. The name Gulf of Mexico, for example, first appeared on Spanish maps in the mid-1500s as a way of honouring the Mexica people who founded the Aztec empire. Yet, the 218,000-sq-mile oceanic basin \u2013 which borders five US states and a longer stretch of shoreline along the eastern coast of Mexico, along with the north-west coast of Cuba \u2013 has had other names too.\nAccording to John Sledge, the museum's maritime historian in residence, when the Spanish first reached the Gulf in 1513, they thought they had found a route to Asia and initially called it the Chinese Sea (a name unlikely to appeal to Trump, Sledge noted). Other early explorers called it the Gulf of Cort\u00e9s or the Gulf of New Spain.\n\"It was really a Spanish sea throughout the 1500s and the 1600s,\" Sledge said. The Spanish were followed by the French, who founded Mobile and New Orleans in the early 1700s. The British gained control of the eastern edge of the region in the 1760s, before the United States finally seized the area in the 1810s.\nThe massive ship-shaped museum, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, is set on a commanding waterfront location in downtown Mobile's Cooper Riverside Park, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mobile's port and bay, which feeds directly into the Gulf. Interactive displays highlight the area's multi-layered history, as well as its global influence. Visitors learn how the first European settlement in the US wasn't in St Augustine, Florida, as is commonly thought, but some 450 miles west on the Gulf in Pensacola. Exhibits also show how the Gulf's waters have become one of the world's most productive fisheries and one of the US's largest oil-producing regions. In addition, the Gulf Stream, which originates here, influences transatlantic shipping routes and moderates the weather in Western Europe by bringing warm tropical waters north.\nOther popular exhibits include a simulator that lets guests practice piloting ships, models of famous shipwrecks, a multi-storey screen tracking European voyages and towers of shipping containers, which hold exhibits. The city of Mobile, museum curators like to say, changed the world when a local company helped launch the first containerised ships in the 1950s.\nMost people have no idea about the region's complex history, says Jack E Davis, whose 2017 book, The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea, won a Pulitzer Prize. \"They associate it with oil spills and hurricanes.\"\nIn recent weeks, Davis says friends have teased him that his 592-page book might have inspired Trump's executive order to rename the body of water. But Davis says he's not happy with the US's official new name for the Gulf, and when he saw the phrase \"Gulf of America\" used last month in an official pronouncement from Florida's governor, he had a physical response. \"I almost puked, it was just awful. It's so wrong.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only town in the US built for Chinese people\n\u2022 The first free Black town in the US\n\u2022 The first king to travel around the world\nGiven that the Gulf has been central to many cultures over the centuries, Davis claims the new name is just too confining. \"It's not just us,\" he said. \"[The name Gulf of Mexico] takes my mind beyond what we call America, beyond the US to other people to other places.\"\nDavis, who grew up along the Gulf Coast, urges travellers to get to know its museums, historic homes and natural scenery. One of his favourite spots is Padre Island National Seashore in Texas. \"If you go to Padre Island and you don't feel emotionally moved, check your pulse, because it's just really this otherworldly place.\"\nAccording to Davis, the Gulf's first residents arrived 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Early European visitors were astonished when they encountered the Calusa people who thrived along what is now south-west Florida. The tribe harvested the Gulf's abundant seafood, and piled up mounds of oyster shells that stretched for miles. Tribe members were so well-nourished they towered over the Europeans.\nThe next several hundred years saw Spain, France and England competing for influence, said Deanne Stephens,a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi and executive director of the Gulf South Historical Association. \"It was quite an amalgamation of players in the region.\"\u00a0\nSince the 19th Century, the Gulf has attracted immigrants from around the world, ranging from fruit-selling Sicilians in New Orleans to Greek sponge divers in Florida. Along Stephens' Mississippi coast, the seafood industry has attracted workers from places as varied as Poland, Croatia, Vietnam and now Latin America. \"Regardless of who was here, it was always recognised by people as a place of opportunity,\" she said.\u00a0\nLikewise, Poth says her museum consistently surprises visitors. \"They had no idea how important the Gulf of Mexico is to the world.\"\nShe's excited about plans for a new exhibit devoted to another Gulf global influencer: the late singer and Mobile city native Jimmy Buffett, whose hits like Margaritaville introduced many around the world to the coast's laid-back lifestyle. Yet, she admits that the project may bring up a host of issues. \"What are we going to call it? Every one of his songs is about the Gulf of Mexico.\"\nSledge, meanwhile, says if Trump wants to change the Gulf's name, a better choice might be to call it the Gulf of the Americas, which would acknowledge its geographic breadth and its enormous challenges. Scientists say the zone faces many threats in the coming century from pollution, coastal erosion and climate change.\n\"It's a shared resource,\" he said. \"We all depend on it, and it's in our interest to take care of it \u2013 whatever we call it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools.\n\"But what do you favour, the character of the man or someone who can pass off both hands at 16? There is good out of both.\"\nIf English rugby is short of the former, it could start looking in less familiar settings.\n\"There are thousands out there like me,\" says Genge of the state system's untapped talent.\n\"But until we open our doors to all the kids and give them the absolutely necessary tools and resources, we are going to keep having this conversation.\"",

        "article_text": "Scientists have cracked the perfect way to boil an egg \u2013 astonishingly, it takes half an hour.\nIt is one of the undisputed facts of life that it is notoriously difficult to cook a perfectly boiled egg. Breakfasts can often be disappointing affairs when, after cracking the shell and dipping your toasted soldier into what you hope will be a culinary delight, you instead find that your yolk is dry and crumbly, or even worse, the egg white is a slimy watery mess.\nThe problem is that the yolk and albumen (the white part of the egg) cook at two different temperatures. Yolk requires a temperature of just 65C (149F) to cook, while the albumen needs a little more heat at 85C (185F).\nConventional methods for cooking eggs, therefore, represent a compromise between those two seemingly incompatible truths. Hard-boil an egg at 100C (212F), and the white will soon become tender and just right. The yolk, however, will be fully set \u2013 which is alright if you like that sort of thing, but disappointing if you're after a soft, runny yolk. Another method of cooking an egg, known as sous vide, involves placing the egg in a water bath at temperatures between 60 and 70C (140-158F) for one hour. This leaves the yolk deliciously runny, but the white can be left slimy and clear.\nHowever, worry not, as researchers have now discovered the perfect method for boiling an egg. What's more, they have shown that the result is not only tastier, but better for you too.\nHow easy is the method to follow?\nI like a runny yolk, so to find out if the periodic method really works, I convinced my husband \u2013 who used to work as a professional chef \u2013 to try it. Although, at first, he was aghast at the idea of boiling an egg for 32 minutes, he diligently performed the instructions as close to the letter as possible. The result, considering the effort he put in, was slightly disappointing. Although the white was pleasingly firm and less watery than that of a soft-boiled egg, the yolk was not runny enough for my taste. It didn\u2019t ooze in the way it ought to. But perhaps one or two minutes less would have made all the difference.\nIn their new paper, researchers led by Pellegrino Musto, a scientist working at Italy's National Research Council in Pozzuoli, first simulated the egg-cooking process using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD is the science of using computers to predict how liquids and gases flow based on the physical laws governing them, such as conservation of mass, momentum and energy.\nThe simulations suggested a new method \u2013 one likely to be entirely unfamiliar to most chefs and amateur cooks \u2013 that might give superior results. The approach, which the authors call periodic cooking, involves alternating between cooking the egg in a pan of boiling water kept at 100C (212F), and placing it into a luke-warm bowl kept at 30C (86F). To get the best results, the egg must be transferred between the two temperatures every two minutes for a total duration of 32 minutes, so it is probably not best suited to home cooks who like to dip in and out of the kitchen leaving their egg unsupervised.\nIf you are willing to put in the effort, however, your rewards will be plentiful. When scientists tried the new method in real life, the resulting egg was exceptional. The researchers confirmed this superiority by analysing the texture, sensory qualities and chemical structure of their perfectly boiled egg using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.\nThe results showed that periodically cooked eggs had a soft yolk similar to that of a sous vide egg \u2013 so far so good. However, unlike eggs cooked sous vide, the white albumen was not runny and uncooked, but instead had a consistency closer to that of a traditionally soft-boiled egg. According to the paper's authors, this is probably because, while temperatures in the periodically cooked egg white ranged between 35C (95F) and 100C (212F) during cooking, the yolk remained at a consistent temperature of 67C (153F) throughout.\nPerhaps most interestingly, chemical analysis revealed that the yolk of periodically cooked eggs contained more polyphenols \u2013 a group of micronutrients mostly found in plants, and touted for their health benefits \u2013 than eggs cooked by other methods. This class of compounds is renowned for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Plants make them as a defence against stressful environmental conditions such as UV radiation, droughts or predation by insects. However, research increasingly shows they can benefit humans too. For example epidemiological studies suggest that high dietary intake of polyphenols is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, specific forms of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.\nEven more reason to try periodically cooked eggs next time you fancy dippy eggs and soldiers for breakfast.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

A bit of a throwback. The place was boiling hot all night. It was an incredible atmosphere.\"\nAnd in those few words, Moyes summed up the special magic of Goodison Park.\nIt may be creaking in parts, but on fiery nights like this with Liverpool as the opposition, it literally rocks - parts of it really do - with a glorious support and naked hostility like few other places in world football.\nEverton may have that state-of-the-art new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock ready to go next season, but it is an almost impossible task to replicate what they have in this place - ramshackle and old-fashioned in parts admittedly, hence the need to move.\nGoodison Park was never going to go quietly, but this was something else - full of emotion, passion and all the wild scenes of indiscipline Moyes called \"to-ing and fro-ing\" after the final whistle.\nIt may have pillars blocking some of the views, but it still has so much that will be missed with its towering Main Stand and the criss-cross designs on the stands that are the trademark of famous Scottish architect Archibald Leitch.

Not as much as Goodison Park itself but the time-honoured rituals that take place after weaving their way through the terraced houses that landlock the stadium in Winslow Street, Eton Street, Neston Street and Andrew Street.\nLittle did they realise what this emotionally-charged night held in store for them as Everton, rejuvenated under Moyes, stood toe-to-toe with Liverpool, fighting to the end to ensure the final tally of 120 derbies at Goodison Park ended with 41 wins a piece.\nBlue smoke and the smell of cordite filled the air as Everton's team coach arrived, the area around the players entrance packed with supporters.\nIt was spine-tingling as the newer Everton tradition of an air-raid siren blared before Z-Cars, the soundtrack to the start of every Goodison Park game, rang out.\nThe Gwladys Street End, the heartbeat of Everton's support, was covered in flags before kick-off, including banners reading \"We Built This City - 1878\", \"Our Motto Is Our Standard Nil Satis Nisi Optimum\" and one dedicated to Goodison with a Beatles twist declaring \"There Are Places I'll Remember 1892-2025\".\nIt was poignant, as Everton now have only six games left at the place they have long called home.\nThe reborn Beto gave Everton the lead after 11 minutes, but a sometimes unsettled and off-colour Liverpool looked to have secured the three points through Alex Mac Allister and Mohamed Salah, before the drama of Tarkowski's equaliser in the closing seconds. \nAnd the ugly brawl that followed.\nThe strains of Elton John's I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues rang around an exultant Goodison Park after the final whistle.\nAnd there, back on familiar ground in the Goodison Park technical area, was Moyes - prowling in familiar fashion as his Everton fought, showing his desire still burns as he celebrated joyously and drove his team on.\nMoyes is also remembered on Goodison Park's exterior, football's cyclical nature illustrated by his image on The Everton Timeline that snakes its way around the stadium, commemorating moments of significance in the club's history.\nOpposite The Blue Dragon fish bar and The Goodison Cafe - all part of the sights, sounds and smells of Goodison Park - is the large photograph of a 38-year-old, red-headed David Moyes holding up an Everton scarf after his appointment as manager in March 2002.\nThe hair is now white as Moyes, 23 years on and soaked in a lifetime of managerial experience, is back in charge of Everton for his 26th Merseyside derby.

We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)",

        "article_text": "Sweden's long, cold nights might put you off going there in winter, unless, that is, you are in search of that elusive 21st-Century luxury: a good night's sleep.\nThe ferry cuts through the icy Baltic waters as it makes its way around the Stockholm Archipelago. Place names like Skarp\u00f6, Hj\u00e4lm\u00f6\u00a0and G\u00e4lln\u00f6 are painted on rust-red huts lining the jetties. The suffix \"\u00d6\" means island in Swedish, a pictorial representation of a land mass surrounded by sea with two tiny people about to dock.\nI am the only person to disembark at Svarts\u00f6, one of the few islands in the archipelago where accommodation remains open in winter. I make my way along a snowy track to Sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdshotell where I am shown to a cabin on the edge of a forest overlooking the dark expanse of Lake Svarts\u00f6fladen. It feels about as far away from it all as you can get.\nMy room is Swedish simplicity at its most minimal: a bed, a chair and a bedside table. No television, and not much else to distract me from the pristine tranquillity of my surroundings. This is just as well as I am here, primarily, to sleep.\nIn an age of relentless connectivity, sleep has become the ultimate luxury and spawned a new travel trend: sleep tourism, where sleep-deprived travellers are choosing their hotel on the basis of its pillow menu or booking themselves into away-from-it-all sleep retreats with tailored sleep-inducing activities.\nSweden has a different, more natural approach to sleep tourism, however, taking its cue from the landscape and a more traditional way of life. Often associated with bustling, connected cities like Stockholm and Gothenberg, come winter Sweden embraces its sleepy side and is inviting visitors to do the same.\n\"The abundance of accessible nature and large areas of peaceful wilderness, combined with dark nights, cool temperatures and a cultural emphasis on relaxation, makes Sweden an ideal location for sleep tourism,\" explains Christian Benedict, a sleep researcher at Sweden's Uppsala University. \"Studies have shown that technology and the way it impinges on our lives has a significant effect on our sleep, and spending more time in nature is tied to better mental health and fewer sleepless nights.\"\nWell World\nBBC Travel's Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\nWhen I decided to try it for myself, I chose the Stockholm archipelago, a nature-lovers paradise with more than 30,000 islands, many of them uninhabited. Svarts\u00f6 is one of the larger isles but has only around 65 year-round residents. A two-hour ferry ride from Stockholm, in summer it's a popular getaway, luring weekenders and holiday makers with summerhouses, a clutch of restaurants and abundance of nature in which to walk, swim, cycle and kayak.\nIn the winter months, the Sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdshotell is the only accommodation open and its cosy forest cabins, set away from the main building in their own peaceful wooded area, offer the type of peace and quiet that I am after, while not leaving me completely alone in the wilderness.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a city dweller with a restless mind. I often wake several times a night and rise early feeling the need to tackle the long list of things that have kept me awake. Here, on the island in winter, there is little for me to do except hike, read and observe the rhythms of the day in a way I can't when surrounded by the bright lights of a city. \n \n Svarts\u00f6 literally means \"the black island\", referring to the dark granite bedrock, though in winter the name could simply refer to the dark skies that are completely free of city glare. Darkness, long viewed as a metaphor for fear and depression, is embraced in these Nordic regions. Further north in the Arctic Circle, where the polar night blankets the land in darkness for months, far from staying indoors, inhabitants strap on headlamps and explore snowy trails.\nSo I do the same, setting out at dusk past fields of sheep, pigs and goats. I head along the edge of the forest and wander down to the seashore, watching as the sun drops into the water and listening as the noisy drilling of a woodpecker stops, almost as if a switch has been flicked. The surrounding forest falls quiet as the Earth settles down for its own good night's sleep beneath a heavy blanket of snow.\nI find the hotel sauna discreetly tucked between the trees and end the day in classic Scandinavian style, sweating out all the worries that might keep me awake followed by a plunge in the bracing sea.\nAfter a simple dinner of st\u00e5ngkorv (Swedish sausage and kale), I sit by the fire and get talking to a group of kayakers who have paddled here from Stockholm. \"Traditionally, in the darker months, fire was important for warmth and light but also as part of the evening ritual,\" a woman named Marie tells me. \"After dinner people would cosy up around the fire and allow the flicker of flames to sooth away all the stresses of a day's work.\"\nIt works for me. In fact, I find it so soporific that by 20:00 I am ready to retire to my cabin where I hunker down under a duvet and cosy woollen blanket and sleep for an unheard-of 10 hours, waking refreshed to see a sliver of moon above the trees outside.\nIt's easy to think of sleep deprivation as a very 21st-Century problem, but the Swedish legend of the Mara shows that it's as old as the forest. A strange mythical being that was said to torture people in their sleep, causing fear and tight anxiety-ridden chests, Mara gave rise to the word \"nightmare\". But in modern times, technological distractions have replaced mythical creatures as more and more people struggle to get to sleep.\n\"Sweden is one of Europe's most digitalised societies and were early adopters of digitalisation,\" explains Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Cedercreutz, chief commercial officer for Sweden's Scandic Hotels Group. \"Our interest in sleep, and especially the lack of it, can be traced to this and an increased awareness of its impact on our health, which we have set out to counteract with a range of measures. We have blackout rooms, sleep-inducing playlists and wellness areas where mobile phones are banned. If our customers don't sleep, our business as well as their health suffers.\"\nMore like this:\n \u2022 Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n \u2022\u00a0Sweden's wild, animal-free safari\n \u2022\u00a0 The new travel retreats addressing depression and grief\nAround the globe, other, both urban and remote hotels are taking things several steps further.\nLondon's Cadogan Hotel has its own Sleep Concierge service , developed in association with hypnotherapist and sleep expert Malminder Gill, who provides a programme of guided sleep meditation. Mandarin Oriental Geneva has a three-day package, run with a private sleep clinic, that involves studying guests' sleeping patterns and creating individual sleep programmes. In Thailand, amidst the tropical greenery on the Royal Coast, the Civa-Som Hua Hin resort's resident naturopath will guide you through everything from diet to hormones that may be affecting circadian rhythms. Meanwhile, the Carillon Miami Wellness Resort uses electromagnetic and infrared technologies to get guests to sleep.\n\"Our clients were coming to us saying they felt generally depleted, and this often seemed to be down to lack of sleep,\" says Stella Photi, founder of holiday company Wellbeing Escapes. \"We try to incorporate elements of the local cultures into our sleep programmes.\u00a0In Buddhist countries such as Thailand or Sri Lanka we offer mediation and mindfulness. In India, Ayurvedic treatments use locally sourced herbs; and in Italy, guided walks through vineyards are part of a sleep-promoting programme of activities.\"\nIn Sweden, however, it is the experience of being in nature that forms the bedrock of sleep tourism. \"Nature's motto is keep it simple,\" says Jennie Walker, founder of Walkers Naturturer, a nature-guiding business in Sweden's West Coast Archipelago. \"In winter, on the barren outcrops that characterise the Gothenburg Archipelago, there is little vegetation, and the birch and pine trees turn away from the strong west winds. A walk over the boulder fields on a winter's day, perhaps coming across a sunbathing harbor seal on one of the skerries, is the perfect preparation for a good night's rest.\"\nAnd where traditional sleep retreats focus on unwinding before bedtime, in Sweden the focus on sleep begins at dawn with the possibility of pursuing sleep-inducing activities such as hiking, kayaking and forest bathing.\u00a0\nSo, after my mammoth night's sleep, I fuel up with a breakfast of muesli, yoghurt, lingonberry jam and cinnamon buns to hike the Svarts\u00f6 section of the Stockholm Archipelago Trail. This unique 270km long-distance path traverses 20 islands, from Arholma in the north to Landsort in the south.\nOn Svarts\u00f6, the 18km trail takes me around the island, past a large freshwater lake and through the thick snow-carpeted pine forest where I spot the odd red squirrel, follow deer tracks and step over a tree felled by a beaver's gnawing. The whole day is like an extended forest bathing experience, and by the time I head back to my cabin there is little for me to worry about beyond dinner, sitting by the fire and sleeping well \u2013 or \"sov gott\" as they say in the land of sleep.\nAnd I did. It seems that, for me, gentle exercise in peaceful surroundings with few distractions and taking my cue for bed from nature, provides the perfect Circadian reset.\n\"Sleep retreats are not just helping people sleep when they are on holiday,\" says Photi, \"The objective is to allow for a relaxing, holistic and personal approach that will set you up with new sleep, and waking habits, with the aim of bringing about long-lasting change.\"\u00a0\nI'll sleep on that.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Becoming Led Zeppelin is a new authorised documentary that tells the \"untold story\" of the band, who despite achieving global influence and legendary status, are difficult to define.\nRock's mightiest anthems, and the tales surrounding them, tend to be continually replayed \u2013 and sometimes, their power fades over time. Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.\nA night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How opera can be 'open to everyone'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is the 'land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera House cut ties with its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to a UK study conducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work \u2013 and opera houses are no exception.\nThe pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive the Theatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes \u2013 sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations \u2013 spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.\nA key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. \"Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,\" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentary Take Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne. \n\u00a0\nIn 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: \"I know that many opera companies\u2026 don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.\"\nGlyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the global Race to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. \"We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,\" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. \"We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine.\" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. \"Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,\" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. \"This way everything goes back into the ground.\"\nClimate action\nGlyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.\nThe rooftop of the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, for example, is host to an urban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.\nThe Sydney Opera House \u2013 a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 \u2013 has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021, a survey by the UK's Theatres Trust found that it would cost more than \u00a31bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.\nIn the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces.

        "article_text": "A hue now associated with innocence once had a murkier meaning: Kelly Grovier looks at the ways in which pink has represented violence and seduction.\nPink is a double-edged sword. While red is raucous and racy, and white is prim and pure, pink cuts both ways. Long before the word \u201cpink\u201d attached itself to the pretty pastel shade of delicate carnations, as we define the term today, the London underworld enlisted it for something rather less frilly or fragrant \u2013 to denote the act of stabbing someone with a sharp blade. \u201cHe pink\u2019d his Dubblet\u201d, so reads an entry for the word in a 17th-Century dictionary of street slang used by \u201cBeggars, Shoplifters, Highwaymen, Foot-Pads and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains\u201d, describing a lethal lunge through a man\u2019s padded jacket, \u201cHe run him through\u201d.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nAt what point the unlikely linguistic slide was made from mortal piercing to mellow pigment, no one can say for sure. But the enticing hue itself, by whatever name it was known before the assignment of \u201cpink\u201d to the colour chart in the 18th Century, has kept culture blushing since antiquity. Now seductive, now innocent, pink is coquettish and coy, sultry and sly.\nRemove pink from the palette of art history and a teasing dimension to the story of image-making would be lost. Edgar Degas\u2019s Pink Dancers would fall flat-footed and Pablo Picasso\u2019s pivotal pink period wouldn\u2019t rise to the occasion.\nA flesh in the pan\nA key moment in pink\u2019s emergence as an essential element in the development of painting is the creation by the Early Renaissance Italian painter Fra Angelico in the middle of the 15th Century of his famous fresco in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy, The Annunciation, which depicts the moment in the New Testament that the Virgin Mary is informed by the Archangel Gabriel that she will become the mother of Christ. Situated at the top of a staircase solemnly ascended daily by pious monks, Fra Angelico\u2019s ground-breaking painting is one into which an observer\u2019s spirit is summoned to levitate.\nCrucial to sparking that mystical lift-off in the fresco is the portrayal of the ethereal Archangel \u2013 who has himself mystically crossed planes of being to swoop into Mary\u2019s material sphere. Never mind the polychromatic wings, what\u2019s most surprising about Gabriel\u2019s depiction is Fra Angelico\u2019s decision to clad him in plush pleats of sumptuous pink.\nWe know from a contemporary artist\u2019s handbook on how to concoct pigments (Cennino Ceninni\u2019s Il libro dell'arte, published a few decades before Fra Angelico painted his fresco) that pink had been traditionally reserved primarily for the rendering of flesh. \u201cMade from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John\u2019s white\u201d, Cennini explains, \u201cthis pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls\u201d.\nBy draping Gabriel in the lushest of pinks, Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh. Pink is the pivot that humanises heaven. No one would ever see the colour the same way again. In the ensuing centuries, artists would invoke pink as shorthand for the blurring of boundaries.\nBloom of Christ\nAs the focus of Renaissance master Raphael\u2019s Madonna of the Pinks, a sprig of blushing carnations handed to the Virgin Mary by the infant Christ, may seem unremarkable enough at first glance. In fact it amounts to a kind of miraculous wrinkle in the fabric of time. According to religious tradition, dianthus (the Greek name for the plant, meaning \u201cflower of God\u201d), did not appear in the world until Mary wept at her son\u2019s crucifixion.\nThe flower\u2019s anachronistic appearance in Raphael\u2019s scene, therefore, tinged with the future blood of the baby who holds it, mysteriously establishes a pink kink in the linear unfolding of the universe.\nOver time, pink would eventually blossom beyond the petals of its complex theologies to inflect a wider array of secular personality, all the while retaining its elusive allure and capacity to tease. By the 18th Century, pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue.\nFamous portraits by the French Rococo portraitist Maurice Quentin de la Tour of Madame de Pompadour and by the English artist George Romney of his muse Emma, Lady Hamilton (later mistress of Lord Nelson), posing as a mythological maenad, reveal how decidedly deconsecrated the colour had become.\nLa Tour\u2019s full-length pastel-pencil portrait of the official chief mistress to Louis XV of France, begun around 1748, is a rumbunctious jungle gym of superfluous pinks that spider across every inch and threaten to suffocate its subject. Here, pink is an energy that vibrates from the sitter to the secular subjects with which Pompadour has surrounded herself \u2013 music, astronomy, and literature.\nPorcelain pink\nA patron of the porcelain trade, Pompadour had famously inspired the minting by the Sevres porcelain factory of a new hue of pink, delicately bruised by dabs of blue and black. To Pompadour, pink was no longer a mere accessory but a partner in crime \u2013 an aspirational second skin into which she grew intellectually and emotionally. She became her colour.\nNo painting embodies pink\u2019s gradual pendulum movement from the spiritual to the secular more vividly than the French artist Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s exuberant The Swing, painted around 1767, between La Tour\u2019s and Romney\u2019s works. Here, a fabulous flounce of flowing rose is frozen in mid swivel as the swinging girl, pillowed in pinkness, flicks loose a silk shoe, attracting the titillated attention of any number of camouflaged male gazes hiding in the bushes around her. We\u2019re a long way from the pink whisper of angels now.\nIn more recent times, pink continues to be seized upon by artists keen to confound our expectations of what notes or message the floral pigment can confidently carry. Having established a formidable reputation in the middle of the 20th Century as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist, eschewing figurative subjects entirely in the 1950s, Canadian-born American artist Philip Guston reached for pink in a dramatic turn back to representational art in the late 1960s.\nBy then, the colour itself had undergone something of a commercial transformation in American retail culture, having begun the century as a shade more often associated with boys and masculinity than fairy princesses and little girls\u2019 dolls. But by the time Guston began introducing a menacing cast of Ku Klux Klan-inspired cartoon goons, whose implausibly pale pink stubby hoods continue to menace popular imagination to this day, the colour had been re-commodified as delicate and feminine. Grabbing pink by the scruff for his unsettling scenes of a seedy Americana, Guston slaps Barbie across the chops.\nAt the same moment that Guston\u2019s provocative pink was poking the art world in the eye, scientific studies were underway by Alexander Schauss, Director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, to determine whether manipulations of the colour could help control the behaviour of subjects surrounded by it. The result of Schauss\u2019s investigation was the concoction of the psychologically subtle shade now known as \u201cBaker-Miller Pink\u201d, after the Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington where the pigment was successfully tested on the walls of inmates\u2019 cells and credited with a significant calming of aggressive urges.\nYet despite its ability to inspire docility, pink is still picking fights, challenging our perceptions to an aesthetic duel. Upon learning that the British artist Anish Kapoor had signed a contract giving him exclusive rights to a recently engineered colour known as Vantablack (the darkest shade ever devised), and the legal right to prohibit other artists from doing so, Kapoor\u2019s younger contemporary Stuart Semple saw red.\nEmboldened by Kapoor\u2019s black embargo, Semple began concocting a supremely-fluorescent pink paint he contends is the \u201cpinkest pink\u201d ever contemplated (\u201cno one has ever seen a pinker pink\u201d, he insists). As a poke in the eye of Kapoor, Semple has made his colour available at a small price to anyone in the world so long as they confirm that they are not Anish Kapoor nor friendly enough with Kapoor to share it with him.

He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 league matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".That all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.Latest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022How has Maresca tried to solve the problem?Maresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.The France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 league matches in all competitions.He opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.But the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.As a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.They completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.Speaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. \"Related topicsChelseaPremier LeagueFootball \"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.",

        "article_text": "The world's only museum dedicated to the history and culture of the Gulf of Mexico may be in hot water following Trump's decision to change the name of the planet's largest gulf.\nLast year Karen Poth decided it was time to rename the museum she runs in Mobile, Alabama, to better reflect its unique status.\nTo do so, she first had to line up support from elected officials and her board of directors before raising money for the project. Next, she needed to update the museum's website, logo and printed materials. Then in April 2024, she finally unveiled the new name in letters stretching 50ft across the eight-storey building: the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, the only museum in the world dedicated to the history, folklore and culture of the largest gulf on Earth.\nSo, imagine her response when US President Donald Trump recently announced that he planned to rename the body of water to the south of the US from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. \"My personality is to laugh,\" Poth said. \"Or else you cry.\"\nThe name change, which was signed into law on 20 January and is part of a broader Trump effort to \"honour American greatness\", has created an international firestorm. After Google recently announced that it would follow Trump's executive order and also change the Gulf's name on Google Maps in the US, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argued that Trump alone cannot legally do that.\nPoth says she's not taking sides, but admits she's overwhelmed at the thought of what would happen if the museum had to change every reference to the Gulf of America. \"It would be a complete redo of the entire museum. If you think about it, every audio, every video, every digital, every sign\u2026 that will be very, very expensive.\"\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nSince the museum is owned by the city of Mobile, Poth said she will ultimately follow city officials' leads. \"If I need to change the name of the museum, we'll be up there changing the signage on the top of the building.\" The museum still carries debt from its opening a decade ago, and Poth estimates that changing the museum's name in 2024 cost nearly $100,000.\nBut as visitors to the museum learn, the Gulf has actually had many names throughout its multi-cultural history. The name Gulf of Mexico, for example, first appeared on Spanish maps in the mid-1500s as a way of honouring the Mexica people who founded the Aztec empire. Yet, the 218,000-sq-mile oceanic basin \u2013 which borders five US states and a longer stretch of shoreline along the eastern coast of Mexico, along with the north-west coast of Cuba \u2013 has had other names too.\nAccording to John Sledge, the museum's maritime historian in residence, when the Spanish first reached the Gulf in 1513, they thought they had found a route to Asia and initially called it the Chinese Sea (a name unlikely to appeal to Trump, Sledge noted). Other early explorers called it the Gulf of Cort\u00e9s or the Gulf of New Spain.\n\"It was really a Spanish sea throughout the 1500s and the 1600s,\" Sledge said. The Spanish were followed by the French, who founded Mobile and New Orleans in the early 1700s. The British gained control of the eastern edge of the region in the 1760s, before the United States finally seized the area in the 1810s.\nThe massive ship-shaped museum, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, is set on a commanding waterfront location in downtown Mobile's Cooper Riverside Park, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mobile's port and bay, which feeds directly into the Gulf. Interactive displays highlight the area's multi-layered history, as well as its global influence. Visitors learn how the first European settlement in the US wasn't in St Augustine, Florida, as is commonly thought, but some 450 miles west on the Gulf in Pensacola. Exhibits also show how the Gulf's waters have become one of the world's most productive fisheries and one of the US's largest oil-producing regions. In addition, the Gulf Stream, which originates here, influences transatlantic shipping routes and moderates the weather in Western Europe by bringing warm tropical waters north.\nOther popular exhibits include a simulator that lets guests practice piloting ships, models of famous shipwrecks, a multi-storey screen tracking European voyages and towers of shipping containers, which hold exhibits. The city of Mobile, museum curators like to say, changed the world when a local company helped launch the first containerised ships in the 1950s.\nMost people have no idea about the region's complex history, says Jack E Davis, whose 2017 book, The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea, won a Pulitzer Prize. \"They associate it with oil spills and hurricanes.\"\nIn recent weeks, Davis says friends have teased him that his 592-page book might have inspired Trump's executive order to rename the body of water. But Davis says he's not happy with the US's official new name for the Gulf, and when he saw the phrase \"Gulf of America\" used last month in an official pronouncement from Florida's governor, he had a physical response. \"I almost puked, it was just awful. It's so wrong.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only town in the US built for Chinese people\n\u2022 The first free Black town in the US\n\u2022 The first king to travel around the world\nGiven that the Gulf has been central to many cultures over the centuries, Davis claims the new name is just too confining. \"It's not just us,\" he said. \"[The name Gulf of Mexico] takes my mind beyond what we call America, beyond the US to other people to other places.\"\nDavis, who grew up along the Gulf Coast, urges travellers to get to know its museums, historic homes and natural scenery. One of his favourite spots is Padre Island National Seashore in Texas. \"If you go to Padre Island and you don't feel emotionally moved, check your pulse, because it's just really this otherworldly place.\"\nAccording to Davis, the Gulf's first residents arrived 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Early European visitors were astonished when they encountered the Calusa people who thrived along what is now south-west Florida. The tribe harvested the Gulf's abundant seafood, and piled up mounds of oyster shells that stretched for miles. Tribe members were so well-nourished they towered over the Europeans.\nThe next several hundred years saw Spain, France and England competing for influence, said Deanne Stephens,a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi and executive director of the Gulf South Historical Association. \"It was quite an amalgamation of players in the region.\"\u00a0\nSince the 19th Century, the Gulf has attracted immigrants from around the world, ranging from fruit-selling Sicilians in New Orleans to Greek sponge divers in Florida. Along Stephens' Mississippi coast, the seafood industry has attracted workers from places as varied as Poland, Croatia, Vietnam and now Latin America. \"Regardless of who was here, it was always recognised by people as a place of opportunity,\" she said.\u00a0\nLikewise, Poth says her museum consistently surprises visitors. \"They had no idea how important the Gulf of Mexico is to the world.\"\nShe's excited about plans for a new exhibit devoted to another Gulf global influencer: the late singer and Mobile city native Jimmy Buffett, whose hits like Margaritaville introduced many around the world to the coast's laid-back lifestyle. Yet, she admits that the project may bring up a host of issues. \"What are we going to call it? Every one of his songs is about the Gulf of Mexico.\"\nSledge, meanwhile, says if Trump wants to change the Gulf's name, a better choice might be to call it the Gulf of the Americas, which would acknowledge its geographic breadth and its enormous challenges. Scientists say the zone faces many threats in the coming century from pollution, coastal erosion and climate change.\n\"It's a shared resource,\" he said. \"We all depend on it, and it's in our interest to take care of it \u2013 whatever we call it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "Zakaria is 11 years old and lives in Gaza. He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.\nBut at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.\nAs a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.\nMoments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.\nSeveral of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)",

        "article_text": "Ticket sales for Beyonc\u00e9's highly-anticipated Cowboy Carter tour seem to have gone without a hitch, with many fans expressing surprise at how easy the process was.\nIn contrast to the chaos surrounding Oasis and Taylor Swift's tours, online queues were kept to a minimum, and most people found the tickets they were looking for.\n\"I was in straight away, only 600 in front of me,\" wrote one fan on Reddit. \"I was able to find floor tickets for London even 30 min[utes] after general sale opened,\" added Shivam Arora on X. \"Not bad, to be honest.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9's six UK dates at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in June will be her first shows since 2023's record-breaking Renaissance Tour. \nTicketmaster said prices ranged from \u00a371 to \u00a3950, but cheaper tickets were also available direct from the stadium's own website.\nThe BBC was able to access Ticketmaster's page shortly after tickets went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Friday; and found tickets available in almost every section.\nThe stadium map slowly greyed out as seats were snapped up - but prices remained static, suggesting that \"dynamic pricing\" was not in place.\nNone of the dates were completely sold out at the time of writing, although in some cases only single seats remained.\nBeyonc\u00e9's tour launched on a massive day for concertgoers - with tickets also becoming available for Ozzy Osbourne's final gig with Black Sabbath plus Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Patti Smith, Beck, Morrissey, Mumford & Sons, Razorlight and Smashing Pumpkins.\nOne fan told the BBC they were willing to pay up to \u00a32,000 to attend Black Sabbath's charity concert in Birmingham, which will also feature performances from Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax, Gojira and members of Guns N' Roses.\n\"This really is Ozzy's final show with Sabbath,\" said Alex Woodford. \n\"I know it sounds crazy but I would be willing to pay silly money for it because it's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime show.\"\nBritish Beyonc\u00e9 fan Ben Archer, who has attended all of her concerts since 2014's Mrs Carter World Tour, was among those who secured tickets. \"She is the one artist I'm determined to see every time she tours,\" he told the BBC.\nEleven years ago, he paid \u00a360 for a standing ticket. This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

        "article_text": "BBC's Discovering the World's Table sees food writer Nick Kwek journey to his ancestral homeland of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo, where he eats pufferfish with the Bajau Laut sea nomads, learns the art of rice wine-making and is given a secret hangover cure.\nPristine turquoise waves lap our boat as we depart the harbourfront in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah's busy state capital, and sail towards a jungle oasis. But it's not an island paradise we're heading for \u2013 in fact we're not touching foot on land at all. Instead, we're destined for a cluster of stilted shacks perched above the water's surface some 7km from the shore. The settlement is home to the Bajau Laut, a nomadic community who live most of their lives at sea.\u00a0\u00a0\nWho better to kickstart my culinary adventure around Sabah with than the Bajau, who eat Malaysia's spectacular seafood for breakfast, lunch and dinner? But first we'll need to catch it. As renowned hunters, they follow the fish, dismantling and rebuilding their makeshift houses as they go, expertly freediving and spearfishing their prey with seemingly supernatural skill.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"They can erect them in as fast as a day,\" says local tour guide, Emily Chin, who has been working with the Bajau and other Indigenous groups for years. \"They're so connected with the sea that they often don't know what to do if they're not on the sea \u2013 it's almost like a third arm for them.\"\nIndeed, their bodies have evolved over the years giving them extra-large spleens that act like a biological \"scuba tank\", allowing them to hold their breath for up to 10 minutes at a time. Meanwhile, my breath has been taken away.\nMeet the expert:\nNick\u00a0Kwek\u00a0is a food writer, presenter and filmmaker who has travelled the world documenting stories for BBC series including Discovering The World's Table, The Travel Show and Click. He's reported for BBC News, ABC and SBS and contributed to leading food and drink publications.\nKwek\u00a0grew up into a family of chefs and bakers, before working in some of Scotland's best bars and restaurants.\nThis is my first time back in my father's homeland, Sabah, in almost two decades. Born and raised in Fife, Scotland, I grew up in my parent's pan-Asian restaurant, surrounded by the billowing smoke of red-hot woks, scorching chilli and fragrant ginger. The exotic flavours and enchanting ingredients of my childhood inspired my passion for food and an insatiable appetite for travel.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo be returning here to discover more about Sabah's traditional dishes, explore its local ingredients and their heritage is an emotional, fantastical experience.\u00a0\nKwek is a Chinese surname, with my father's side part of Malaysia's largest ethnic minority \u2013 the Chinese-Malay community. They live alongside Malays, Indians and Indigenous groups that make up the melting pot that is Malaysia. And it's this uniquely rich cultural diversity that makes for a very special cuisine, bursting with bold, lasting flavours.\nToday\u2019s menu is no different \u2013 the Bajau are treating me to freshly-caught pufferfish, notoriously poisonous if not prepared correctly and usually served on special occasions such as weddings or family reunions. It's boiled with chilli, garlic, turmeric and fresh calamansi juice, a native citrus with the appearance and sourness of a miniature lime but with the sweet zing of clementine orange. The dish is both hot and tangy, with the fish unexpectedly meaty, reminiscent of monkfish.\u00a0\nWhilst cooking, Chin introduces me to a delicacy adored by the Bajau: latok, a type of seaweed, normally eaten raw. Glistening green globes, these mini bunches of \"sea grapes\" pop on your tongue, releasing a salty, juicy, refreshing essence of the sea. This so-called green caviar is gaining popularity across Southeast Asia as a healthy and nutritious snack.\u00a0\nBack on dry land, it's an ingredient celebrated by chef Raphael Lee, of high-end eatery OITOM in downtown Kota Kinabalu. Originally from Sabah, he moved to Melbourne, Australia, to train in refined cooking techniques before returning to introduce a new fine dining concept to the city, catering to its burgeoning middle class and international visitors.\n\"Oitom means 'black' in Kadazan-Dusun [the language of Sabah's largest ethnic group]\", Lee tells me. \"We are championing heritage cuisines through the lens of the culinary world.\" Named in honour of Lee's heritage, the restaurant has a dark-black interior that acts as a stage so his colourful plates can shine.\nToday we're preparing a raw white fish salad called hinava, a traditional cured dish of the Kadazan-Dusun tribes. Akin to ceviche, it comprises grouper, fresh chilli, ginger, shallots, calamansi juice and bambangan (an indigenous wild mango). But Lee's modern take on the classic dish involves homemade kombucha, strawberries foraged from the foothills of Mount Kinabalu and latok.\u00a0\n\"We have around 33 tribes in Borneo and each prepares their hinava differently. Some use vinegar, some use bambangan seed. Food is all about cross-culture, and of course whilst we want to treasure the authenticity of our cuisine, for its growth, it needs innovation as well,\" he says.\nLee's version is delicately presented, with each element tweezered into place and the taste\u00a0is softer, smoother and more complex than the original.\nSeafood is undeniably the star of the show in Sabah. Coastal towns sprawl with fish markets, while restaurants and food courts have tanks teaming with live, freshly caught grouper, crabs, lobsters, prawns and clams. These ingredients play a leading role in the country's signature specialities like the lusciously spicy curry laksa, char kway teoh (a gloriously fatty fried noodle mix) and the iconic butter prawns \u2013 delightfully crispy yet wondrously creamy, served in the shell.\u00a0\nBut as well as sublime seafood surrounding the huge island of Borneo (the third largest island in the world at around 290,000 sq km), inland is another staple of the modern Malaysian diet: rice.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Mandy Yin's Sarawak white chicken\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nPopularised with the arrival of migrants from China, India, Sumatra and Thailand during British colonialism in the 19th Century, rice takes centre stage for the country's national dish, nasi lemak. A meal made of several parts but almost always coconut rice, boiled eggs, cucumber, sambal sauce and tiny dried fish known as \"bilis\". (Try it with beef rendang \u2013 a dry lemongrass and coconut stew \u00ad\u2013 you won't regret it.)\nTwo hours' drive over the hills into the mountain valley of Keningau belies a sea of green fields \u2013 \u00a0pastures of rice paddies as far as the eye can see. Out in the blistering Sun I meet village chief Mami Ita whose family has been growing rice here and making traditional tapai (rice wine) for generations. She welcomes me to her home where she teaches me how it's made.\nWe start by building a fire and boiling rice that's leftover from last year's harvest and has had time to sufficiently harden. \"It's a family activity,\" she tells me, something sacred to bond over. In addition to love, the secret ingredient here is ragi, a yeast formed by hand. The caressing of the yeast helps form its unique flavour profile as the scent and spirit of its handler becomes solidified within. Each family's brew produces its own distinct taste.\n\"You don't touch chilli or lemon for two weeks before handling the ragi,\" warns Mami Ita, whose yeast starter used today was her grandmother's.\nInstead of a wooden barrel, the wine is matured inside a clay pot known as a tajau, but it's left to age without water. Only upon opening a tajau several months later is water added and the newly infused wine ready to drink. Before I sip, Mami Ita lets me in on a secret ritual to keep the hangover demons at bay.\n\"Place your finger into the wine, then touch it against your forehead and then into your belly button and say \"Tuka Tuka!\" To my disbelief, it worked!\u00a0\nTapai is having a moment in Borneo. It's being reimagined at Limau & Linen, a contemporary restaurant and lounge in Kota Kinabalu's upmarket Signal Hill neighbourhood, where proprietor and executive chef Linn Yong mixes rice wine with coconut syrup and pineapple juice before garnishing the cocktail with local mountain flowers.\u00a0\nYong is keen to convey that Malaysia's cuisine is a reflection of its people. She's crafted a dish that honours her nation's diversity yet togetherness: the \"tajau treasure community pie\". A confit of smoked octopus, scallops and shrimp, rice, rice wine and fish stock\u00a0are combined in a tajau and topped with a puff pastry lid. It's a celebration of Sabah's bounty, intended to be enjoyed together.\n\"Behind every restaurant is a community of farmers and customers. For me it's like breaking bread with the people we love,\" says Yong.\u00a0\nAs the pie reaches the table and Yong makes a speech about her creation's genesis, steam rises up around us, filling the room with a warm comforting aroma that brings me home. A befitting finale to our journey of discovery, reconnection and the indelible impact of cultural traditions.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

[They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model. They've got some outstanding young German coaches. We have one coaching our national team, which is fantastic.\n\"What you see - and this is over the last 10 years - is that they have younger coaches who have been given opportunities in the Bundesliga.\n\"They've been more exposed to that level earlier, so maybe that's something we can look at. But, for me, it's not about the nationality of a manager, it's about the qualities that they bring.\"\nWith just 20 managerial spots available does the Premier League feel a bit of a closed shop?\n\"Sometimes,\" says Still. \"But it's difficult to sort of have a grasp or a proper sense of what the reality is.\n\"I don't know what those Premier League clubs are thinking. I don't know how they're working. I don't know what their next step in their recruitment process is.\n\"It's the best league in the world for a reason so you've got to be one of the best in the world and that's what I think we all aspire to do.\"\nRosenior sees it somewhat differently.\n\"I think it depends on what your ultimate goal is,\" he says. \"My ultimate goal isn't to be in the Premier League.\n\"I don't think football is a linear thing where you say, 'Right, I worked in the Championship, I'm going to go to the Premier League'.\n\"My ultimate goal is to be the best coach I can be and it's up to the decision makers at each football club to pick who they think the right coach is for their club.\"\nThere was a time when few British players ventured overseas, but the numbers are growing season upon season. Should British coaches seek to do similar?\n\"I think it's a great experience,\" says Still \"I think learning about different cultures, different ways of playing the game, different opposition, different players. I'd definitely encourage it because you open yourself up to a lot more.\"\nRosenior adds: \"It's not for me to say to anyone where they should take their careers. And it's not about nationality. It's just about being the best person you can be and working as hard as you can every day.\"\nBoth Rosenior and Still have worked exceptionally hard to get to where they are right now in their careers and the decisions they have made have set them on a collision course which will culminate, temporarily at least, at Lens' Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Sunday.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "In 1966, the BBC's Tomorrow's World visited a party in New York organised by the electronic dating service Tact, or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing. Around 2,000 singles were invited to Manhattan to try out this modern method of matchmaking.\nIn 1788, a man going by the name of \"AB\" placed New York's first known personal ad in the Impartial Gazetteer, according to historian Francesa Beauman. He was seeking a woman \"under 40, not deformed, and in possession of at least one thousand pounds\". Describing himself as \"a young gentleman of family and fortune, who is lately come to town\", the ad was the Tinder bio of its day. Whether AB had any replies to his ad is unknown. But nearly 200 years later, New York was the home of another novel approach to dating \u2013 computer matchmaking.\nInvented by Bob Ross (a computer programmer at IBM, not the painter), and accountant Lewis Altfest, Tact \u2013 or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing \u2013 launched in New York 60 years ago, in 1965. First confined to the Upper East Side, it soon expanded to the entire city and had thousands signing up to be matched by computer. Each hopeful had to pay $5 (\u00a32) and fill in a questionnaire, which would then be used to match people \"on three levels\", according to Ross: socio-cultural factors, opinions and values, and psychological factors. The answers were fed into the computer, which would then spit out supposed matches of the opposite gender. Same-sex dating was not an option. \"Tact is not a lonely-hearts club,\" Ross told the BBC's Tomorrow's World. \"It's not a marriage brokerage service. It's a new fun way of meeting new people.\" He pointed out that it was open to \"all fun-loving people between 18 and 45\", and added: \"People go into Tact for a number of reasons. Some of the people go into it just to meet new people, to get a lot of dates\u2026 some people want to get more serious, they are interested in forming a more lasting relationship, and then there are people who just want to get married.\"\nThe matchmaking questions were approved by psychologist Dr Salvatore V Didato, who felt there was \"a great social need\" for services such as Tact. He complained of other services, \"They say that they match people on many, many variables, but it winds up that they match them only on age, sex, religion, and height, or something like that.\" The Tact questionnaire went further by including a series of statements with which respondents had to either agree or disagree. The BBC report features responses from a typical customer: \"I worry over my relationships with people \u2013 yes. I enjoy people who express affection freely \u2013 yes. Most of the time I act as an independent \u2013 no. I enjoy going to parties \u2013 yes.\"\nWhile Tact was at the crest of a new technological wave, it was not quite the first computer-aided dating service. The two inventors had been inspired by Operation Match, which had been started earlier that year by Harvard students \u2013 decades before some students at the same university would create another computer-powered way for people to connect: Facebook.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nIn 1965, computers were still novel. Operation Match had to rent one of the university's computers for $100 an hour. It quickly proved popular, with thousands of students sending in questionnaires. \"You thought the computer was god, and the computer knew all,\" co-creator Jeff Tarr told the BBC's\u00a0Witness History\u00a0in 2014. Coincidentally, Tarr's daughter would go on to marry one of the creators of Match.com, one of the first internet dating sites. The computer provided reassurance: instead of relying on luck when finding your partner, you could be algorithmically matched to your soulmate.\nThe 1960s were a time of revolution. In the United States, the civil rights and second wave feminism movements were in full flow. Social norms were changing, and technology was developing quickly, too: the arrival of the computer coincided with society's increased permissiveness. By 1969, computer dating \u2013 or at least the idea of it \u2013 was mainstream enough to feature as a storyline in Bewitched, the supernatural sitcom. Samantha's cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery plays both characters) signs up to a computer dating service to find a mortal to marry, only to be matched with a warlock. Even Bob Ross himself found love through Tact \u2013 although it wasn't thanks to the computer. According to a New Yorker article published in the New Yorker in 2011, he eventually married a journalist who interviewed him about the project.\nTact's thousands of willing customers signalled a shift away from the more formal courtship culture of the first half of the century, and towards more modern attitudes. However, these early computer matchmaking services did not last long. While some people found their perfect partners, the services had a few fatal limitations. Because the services were primarily aimed at middle-class college students and graduates, there was a finite pool of potential matches. Also, the system was inefficient \u2013 it could be weeks between sending off your questionnaire and receiving your matches, who you then had to contact by phone or post. The parties organised by Tact were an attempt to get matches to mingle despite the distances that might be involved. Even then, it could still be awkward. The BBC's report pointed out that even \"a public relations man present couldn't get this party going until after dark,\" despite a prize of \"a big night out on the town\" for the most compatible couple present. Possibly the paper sign hung between two bins did not inspire confidence in the service.\nThe questions left something to be desired, too. As well as all the basic demographic and attraction-related queries, the form's \"dislikes\" section had options such as \"homosexuals\" and \"interracial couples\". The questionnaire also played to stereotypes: according to the New Yorker, men were asked to rank women's hairstyles, whereas women could specify where they could find their ideal man: chopping wood, painting in a studio, or in a garage.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The risqu\u00e9 romcom that defined a genre\n\u2022\u00a0The man behind the puzzle that 99% can't solve\n\u2022\u00a0Gloria Steinem on the trailblazing Ms Magazine\nWhile the creators were proud of the detail in their \"three levels\" of compatibility testing, their Cupid's arrows weren't always on target. \"We matched an older brother with his younger sister,\" admitted Ross. \"That didn't work out too well.\" He also said they'd had \"a number of people who weren't too satisfied after they've gone out\". On Tomorrow's World, one potential client quizzed Dr Didato on the robustness of the matching computer, after a bad experience with another service. \"She specified an age limit and gets some guy 20 years older!\"\nStill, while Tact, Operation Match and other similar services now seem comparatively quaint, people keep using technology to guide them towards romance \u2013 from the first personal ads in newspapers to video dating services, from online dating sites to AI-aided apps. According to Pew Research, one in 10 people who had partners in the US in 2023 met them via online dating. When it comes to matters of the heart, it seems, we can't help falling in love with the latest innovations.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

So it's a big blow, obviously, because of the injuries that we have. \nHavertz joins Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli on the sidelines, leaving Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and teenager Ethan Nwaneri as the side's only recognised forwards.\nArteta has had to deal with a number of injury issues throughout the season, with the likes of Ben White, Martin Odegaard and Riccardo Calafiori all missing lengthy spells. \nIn September, Manchester City captain Rodri said players were 'close' to going on strike to protest against the increase in matches due to revamped Uefa competitions and a Fifa Club World Cup.\nA week later, he was ruled out for at least six months after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament. \n\"We've had players who are injured who've played 130 games in the last two seasons so it's an accident waiting to happen when you continue to load, load and load,\" said Arteta. \n\"The intensity is at a different level and the demands in terms of minutes in this competitive environment is getting higher and higher and it's a consequence of that. \n\"The amount of muscle and tendon injuries is higher than ever so there's a relationship.\n\"We're very limited and we're training less than ever. There's no time for training.\"\nWith the transfer window now closed, Arteta says he would consider signing a free agent to ease the club's injury crisis in attack. \n\"I'll explore every possible situation and make a decision from there,\" he said. \nThis video can not be played\nCan Ethan Nwaneri solve Arsenal's injury crisis?\nWatch The Football News Show's Premier League weekend preview\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone\nBen Dinnery, founder of Premier Injuries, says there has been a reduction in injuries this season compared to the previous campaign. \n\"The narrative is that injuries are going through the roof this season, but they are actually not,\" Dinnery told BBC Sport's Football News Show.\n\"In terms of time loss absence we've actually seen a reduction season on season over the same period compared to 2023-24 by roughly 13%.\"\nHowever, Dinnery says there has been an increase in muscle injuries such as hamstring strains. \n\"I's the type of injuries [getting more severe] and the length of return to play that is taking a little bit longer,\" said Dinnery. \n\"When we took the 2023-24 season in isolation, looking at the previous four on average, we've seen an increase in hamstring injuries, certainly at the severe end, by about 65%. \n\"By severe we mean hamstring injuries that are likely to keep a player out for more than 30 days.

        "article_text": "Historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela explores life, love and death on Earth's second-tallest peak in the new season of Extreme.\nStraddling the border of Pakistan and China in the Karakoram mountain range, K2 is often referred to as the \"savage mountain\". Towering 8,611m and reaching into the heavens like a snowcapped pyramid, K2 is the world's second-tallest mountain (topped only by Everest) and arguably the hardest to climb. In Peak Danger, the second season of BBC's Extreme podcast, host and historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela chronicles the harrowing tale of newlyweds Cecilie Skog and Rolf Bae, who scaled K2 in 2008 \u2013 and found themselves in a disaster that would see 11 climbers lose their lives in two days.\nFor Skog, the allure of the mountains came early. She was born surrounded by formidable peaks and explains that even as a child, she often found herself drawn to the alpine heights all around her. Like many climbers, she called the rush of scaling mountains \"addictive\".\n\"I grew up in \u00c5lesund, a little town on the west coast of Norway, and surrounding this little town is mountains everywhere. It is really beautiful there,\" Skog says on the podcast. \"These mountains, they should have given it with, like a warning sign: 'this is really addictive.'\"\nWhile climbing mountains all over the world, Skog also found love and married climber Rolf Bae. After years of honing their skills, the couple decided their honeymoon would be the perfect opportunity to venture to Asia and attempt to scale K2. Their journey started in Pakistan at the Baltoro Glacier, a near-mythical landscape home to six peaks over 7,900m. The beautiful, nearly untouched scenery is one draw, but it is accompanied by the thrill of high altitude, steep cliffs and breathtaking ascents \u2013 and the always-present spectre of cheating death.\n\"If you are going to take on K2, you got to be at the top of your game. That is why it is known, in climbing circles, as 'the mountaineer's mountain,'\" Petrzela says. That reputation was something Skog and Bae were well aware of, as well as the inevitable possibility of facing a life-or-death emergency.\n\"The most important thing cannot be to summit; the most important thing has to be to come back home alive,\" Skog says in the podcast.\nUpon their arrival to the Karakoram Range, Skog and Bae joined some 30 hopeful, optimistic climbers from far-flung countries such as Serbia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and South Korea, as well as a team of Nepalese and Pakistani porters. They were experienced and knowledgeable about the conditions, the dangers and the possibility of inclement weather. Avalanches, rockfall and unpredictable blizzards weren't unheard of \u2013 but there was another sign: a memorial at the beginning of the journey dedicated to those who had lost their lives while attempting to scale K2.\n\"When you arrive, you see a huge pile of brown, weathered rocks, all stacked on top of one another. It is adorned with crisscrossing flags, and pictures of fallen climbers,\" Petrzela says.\nThe memorial isn't enough to deter climbers, nor is the low oxygen level and bitingly cold temperatures.\n\"What I experienced was: 'why am I here\u2026 am I in the right place?' I questioned myself. I questioned my motivation for being there,\" fellow climber Dr Eric Meyer says on the podcast. \"And then you start to reflect on\u2026 is it worth the risk?\"\nListen to the whole Extreme story\nPeak Danger is season 2 of Extreme, the BBC podcast about those who chase the impossible, who strive for superhuman status and refuse to accept that life has any limits. Historian and podcaster Natalia Mehlman Petrzela returns with a sky-high story of human vs nature and surviving against all the odds.\u00a0\nIf you would like to listen to the full podcast series, search for Extreme wherever you get your podcasts.\u00a0\nIt has never been easier for intrepid travellers to challenge themselves and face K2. Petrzela explains on the podcast that a cottage industry has materialised and offers all the necessities for anyone hoping to be among the few who can say they've summited the mountain. However, that commercialisation has led to concerns over climbers' safety and the sometimes-laissez-faire approach to what is undoubtedly a very dangerous trek.\n\"There is no rulebook to mountain climbing. No international association telling you what or how to climb. And there is nothing to stop anyone from making mountaineering into big business. Nowadays, for the right price, you too can buy your way onto the slopes of an 8,000m peak,\" Petrzela says. While there is no association overseeing all climbers, there is the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (or UIAA), which \"developed standards for over 25 types of safety equipment, including helmets, harnesses and [crampons]\".\nAs the group faced a few unexpected challenges \u2013 including a curious case of missing equipment \u2013 Skog explains that the prospect of turning around did enter her mind, but she was still drawn to the peak. \"[I thought] we should turn around, because this is crazy. But again... we are looking up and we can see the summit there. We are so close,\" Skog says. \"The closer you get to the summit, the harder it is to turn around.\"\n\"It is like a kind of compulsion, an inexorable force pulling them further and further up the mountain,\" Petrzela says.\nIn what would later be known as the 2008 K2 disaster \u2013 coming after a similar 1986 tragedy that saw five people die on the mountain \u2013 a massive ice avalanche swept away climbers' rope lines, causing many to fall from an especially treacherous section of the mountain known as the \"Bottlekneck\". The incident killed 11 climbers, including Bae. Even the ones lucky enough to make it off K2 were dealing with frostbite and other injuries. Survivors, Petrzela explains, felt \"shellshocked, like a soldier returning from war.\"\nThe names of the climbers were added to the makeshift memorial at basecamp. Reports would call the incident \"one of the worst tragedies in Himalayan history\".\nMore like this: \n \u2022\u00a0The big climate moments to look out for in 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Why some of the world's borders are changing\n\u2022\u00a0The mountaineers collecting hard-to-reach data\nStill, Skog continued adventuring \u2013 partly, she says, to feel the same sense of wonder she shared with her husband. She enlisted friends to trek across Greenland and, later, she completed an unassisted crossing of Antarctica. She has even returned to the Himalayas, though her new perspective has shifted everything, even summit fever.\n\"I did not have the same feeling being there. I felt that this does not belong to me anymore,\" she says.\n*This article is adapted from a script by Natalia Mehlman Petrzela and Leigh Meyer.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.\nIn 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn\u2019t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like Jos\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico \u2013 New Spain \u2013 were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.\u00a0 \n \n - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder\n \n -\u00a0The world\u2019s most mysterious silver cups\n-\u00a0How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence\nThe ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi \u2013 the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years \u2013 is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.\nArchaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account.\nArchaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The a\u00f1il plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn\u2019t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue\u2019s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the a\u00f1il plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered.\nRhapsody in blue\nMaster painters from the Americas are discussed in art history \u2013 if they\u2019re mentioned at all \u2013 as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Ju\u00e1rez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico\u2019s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Ju\u00e1rez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale \u2013 and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Ju\u00e1rez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens\u2019, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue \u2013 if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Ju\u00e1rez died in poverty.\u00a0 If Ju\u00e1rez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe?\nOn the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' \u2018fear of space\u2019 \u2013 the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident \u2013 thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result \u2013 the same as his peers in Mexico \u2013 was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.\nBaltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as \u2018El Echave de los azules\u2019 (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home.\nThe lack of written evidence of the use of a\u00f1il or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren\u2019t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from a\u00f1il by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries.\nThis cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993.\nIt sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993.\nBut the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell.\nEven today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book \u2013 based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible \u2013 demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters \u2013 like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 \u2013 or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.\u00a0\nThis space mirror idea was taken up again by German physicists during World War Two. At the Nazi weapons research centre in Hillersleben, scientists worked on a design to build a terrifying reflective orbiting weapon called the Sonnengewehr or Sun gun in German. In 1945, Time magazine reported that captured German scientists had told US Army interrogators that the Sonnengewehr was meant to act as a death ray, refocusing light from the Sun to set fire to cities or boil away water in lakes. Despite facing evident scepticism from their US interrogators as they handed over their technical drawings, the German scientists had believed that their Sun gun could be operational in 50 years, the chief of Allied technical intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel John Keck, told reporters at the time.\nIn the 1970s, another German\u2010born rocket engineer, Dr Krafft Ehricke, again began looking at the concept. Ehricke had been a member of Germany's V-2 rocket team during World War Two. At the end of the war, he surrendered to the US and was recruited as part of Operation Paperclip, wherein 1,600 scientists, engineers and technicians deemed to be valuable were shielded from prosecution, spirited out of Germany, and allowed to continue their work in the US.\nEhricke became part of the US space programme, and in the 1970s he returned to the idea of building a mirror in space. In 1978, he wrote a paper detailing how giant orbiting mirrors could illuminate the night sky, enabling farmers to plant or harvest 24 hours a day, or could be used to deflect sunlight down onto solar panels on Earth to be converted into electricity on demand. He called this idea Power Soletta. Ehricke, a space-travel enthusiast from childhood and a long-time proponent of colonising other planets, died in 1984 without seeing Power Soletta come to fruition. But he would get his long-desired space flight posthumously when his cremated remains were launched into Earth's orbit in 1997 along with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s counterculture psychologist Timothy Leary.\u00a0\nThroughout the 1980s, Nasa looked repeatedly at the concept of generating solar power by harnessing sunlight with an orbiting mirror system called Solares, but despite government interest the project was never able to secure funding. However, in Russia the idea of solar mirrors took root.\u00a0\nAt the time, a Russian scientist called Vladimir Syromiatnikov was investigating whether large reflective solar sails could be attached to a spaceship. Syromiatnikov was a pioneering figure in space engineering breakthroughs. He had worked on the Vostok rocket, the world's first crewed spacecraft that took Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. He also developed an ingenious spacecraft docking mechanism, the Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS). This was used in July 1975 in the Apollo-Soyuz test project, the first joint space flight by the then Cold War enemies, the US and the USSR, in which a US module carrying three astronauts successfully linked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule carrying two cosmonauts in orbit. His APAS was later used to enable US shuttles to dock with the Russian Mir space station and is still used for docking at the International Space Station.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov thought that if solar sails were attached to a spacecraft they could use the Sun in a similar fashion to how ships' sails use the wind. If the reflective sails could be angled correctly then photons, particles of energy coming from the Sun, could bounce off their mirror-like surfaces and gently propel the craft forward through space without it having to burn any fuel.\nHowever, in Russia during the post-Soviet era, getting funding for ambitious space projects like Syromiatnikov's was difficult unless they could demonstrate a clear economic goal. So Syromiatnikov decided to repurpose his concept. He thought that reflective solar sails on a spacecraft in orbit could act as a mirror, with the craft's thrusters used to angle the sails and keep them in sync with the Sun's position. That mirror could be used to beam down light on Russia's polar regions where the days are extremely short in the winter, illuminating areas shrouded in darkness. The extra sunlight would extend the working day and increase the productivity of farmlands. He also envisioned that the bonus sunshine could reduce the cost of electrical lighting and heating for the area and add to the wellbeing of people in the region.\nThis turned out to be an idea that the government could get behind. And so, funded by the Space Regatta Consortium, a group of Russian state-owned companies and agencies, and overseen by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Syromiatnikov began work on making the Znamya space mirror a reality.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nThe first prototype built, Znamya 1, wasn't actually sent into space, but remained on Earth to be tested so that Syromiatnikov could iron out any technical problems. Znamya 2 was to be the first to go into orbit. Its mirror was made from thin sheets of aluminised Mylar, a lightweight highly reflective material which was thought to be sturdy enough to survive the hostile conditions in space. It was designed to unfurl in eight sections into a circular shape from a rotating central drum mechanism and stay in that form through centrifugal force.\u00a0\n\"During the flight the reflector is wrapped tightly around the body of the craft, and to open it the craft will have to spin round rapidly forcing it out like an umbrella,\" explained the BBC's Bellingham to TV viewers in 1992. \"The trick is that at this height the 20m-wide reflector will then be able to capture the Sun's rays which normally bypass the Earth and reflect them down onto the dark side of our planet.\"\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov's plan was to have multiple Znamya launches, each one with a larger mirror that burned up as it came back to Earth. Russian engineers would be able to study how Znamya's thin reflective sheets performed when they were activated in space, and perfect his design. This would lead to the launch of a permanent Znamya with a massive 200m-wide reflector that would stay in orbit around Earth.\nThe ultimate ambition was to have a grid of up to 36 of these giant mirrors in space with the ability to pivot, enabling them to keep the reflected light targeted on the same spot. A single reflector could be used to light up a peculiar area. \"On a clear night the space reflector could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium, bringing some light relief to the long winter nights,\" said Bellingham. Or multiple reflectors could focus light together to bring greater brightness or illuminate a bigger region. It was estimated that the combined space mirror grid would be able to reflect light 50 times brighter than the Moon and illuminate an area up to 50 miles (90km) across.\u00a0\nOn 27 October 1992, the project was ready, and the crewless spacecraft Progress M-15 launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Znamya 2 on board. After the cargo supply craft docked with the Russian space station, Mir's crew fitted the drum containing the folded reflective solar sheets into position on the Progress spacecraft. Znamya 2 was due to be trialled towards the end of the year, but its deployment was delayed while the Mir crew conducted tests for other upcoming missions. On 4 February 1993, they were finally ready to put the plan into action.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Training for the Apollo 11 Moon mission\n\u2022\u00a0Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\n\u2022\u00a0The 'alien invasion' that scared the US\nThe autonomous Progress spacecraft undocked, and once it was at a distance of some 150m from Mir, it began to rotate, unfurling the mirror like a giant fan which caught the Sun's rays and beamed them back down to Earth.\nThe reflected light had a luminosity roughly equivalent to a full moon and created a spotlight about three miles (5km) wide on Earth. At a speed of five miles per second (8km per second) the patch of light raced from southern France through Switzerland, Germany, and Poland across to western Russia. The crew on Mir were able to see a faint beam of light as it swept through Europe, and despite much of the continent being covered in clouds that day, some people on the ground reported witnessing it as a flash of light. After a few hours, the space mirror deorbited and burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere over Canada.\u00a0\nBack in Russia, the Znamya 2 experiment was hailed as a technical success \u2013 but it also demonstrated some significant challenges for the project. Znamya 2's reflected light had proved much less intense than expected and too diffused to provide practical illumination for a large area on Earth. It had also been tricky maintaining Znamya 2's stability in orbital conditions, and its spotlight's rapid journey across the Earth's surface and fleeting visibility made its real-world uses seem limited.\nBut the mission had provided encouraging results and valuable insights, so Syromiatnikov ploughed ahead with his planned follow-up experiment, Znamya 2.5. This time it would have a 25m mirror, reflecting a luminosity of between five and 10 full moons, and shining a spot of light that would cover an area five miles (8km) wide. The intention was to control the direction of the reflected light beam so it could target a spot on the Earth for several minutes at a time as Znamya 2.5 revolved around the Earth. Two cities in North America were picked to be illuminated by the mirror's sun ray during what would be a 24-hour experiment, as well as several in Europe.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov was heartened by the progress his team was making, and the launch was planned for October 1998. \"We are pioneers in the field,\" he told The Moscow Times in July 1998. \"If the experiment goes according to plan, we propose to send dozens more craft into space in the future on a permanent basis.\"\nBut even before Znamya 2.5 left the ground, Russian space officials began receiving complaints. Astronomers were worried that the mirror would pollute the night sky with light, dazzling their telescopes and obscure their view of the stars. The Royal Astronomical Society went so far as to protest to the Director General of the Space Regatta Consortium about the experiment. Ecologists also raised concerns that its artificial light might cause confusion to animals and plants, disrupting wildlife and nature cycles.\u00a0\nDespite these misgivings, there was considerable global attention and excitement about the Znamya project's potential implications. \"Think what it will mean for the future of mankind,\" Syromiatnikov told The Moscow Times. \"No more electricity bills, no more long, dark winters. This is a serious breakthrough for technology.\" And so, the Znamya 2.5's launch went ahead as planned, and with Mission Control monitoring from Moscow, the larger space mirror was primed to deploy on 5 February 1999.\nAt first everything went as planned; the folded-up space mirror had been attached to Progress, which undocked from Mir without a hitch. It smoothly moved into position away from the space station, Progress's thrusters were commanded to fire, and it began to spin to unfurl the foil mirror. Unfortunately, at the same time an extra command was sent to Progress by mistake, telling it to deploy the antenna it used to communicate for docking manoeuvres. As the antenna extended, Znamya 2.5's thin reflective sheets immediately became caught up in it.\nMission Control in Moscow watched in dismay as footage of the tangled mirror beamed back from Mir, and frantic commands were sent to retract the antenna. But by this time, several yards of foil had already become wrapped around it, tearing the mirror in several places. Realising that they were in danger of ripping the reflective sheets further, the commands were paused. A second desperate attempt to spin the mirror free was tried an hour later, but to no avail.\nCrestfallen, Mission Control recognised that the Znamya 2.5's torn and crumpled mirror could never be unfurled, and allowed it to fall to Earth still attached to the Progress craft. It burnt up in the atmosphere the following day over the Pacific Ocean. \"The mood here is very depressed,\" Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for the Mission Control in Moscow, told the BBC at the time.\u00a0\nIts fall to Earth did not just destroy Znamya 2.5 but the future of Syromiatnikov's idealistic space mirror project. His planned Znamya 3 with a 70m reflecting surface, which was meant to launch in 2001, could not secure funding and was never built. Syromiatnikov, widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding space engineers of his generation, died in 2006, his dreams of solar sails and mirrors unrealised.\u00a0\n\"The failure was especially painful because of the huge worldwide interest that the experiment aroused,\" Lyndin told the BBC in 1999. \"We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programmes \u2013 to do something first and boast about it only after.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

        "article_text": "The Oscar-tipped film by RaMell Ross adapts Colson Whitehead's novel about two boys at an abusive \"reform\" school and shoots it from their point of view. The effect is profound.\nThere's no film this year, perhaps no film this decade, that looks and feels like Nickel Boys. The innovative new film from director RaMell Ross is based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead about an abusive \"reform\" school for boys, and provides a revolutionary perspective on the US's racist past (and how it always informs the present), during the era of Jim Crow. This is in part because it focuses on the human experience rather than oppressive systems and punishment, above all through its use of a first-person viewpoint. Ross drops us behind the eyes of Elwood (Ethan Herisse), an idealistic young man living in Florida in the 1960s, a bright future ahead of him. That's cut short when he's wrongfully convicted of car theft and sent to Nickel Academy. The school is functionally a jail, based on a real institution in Florida known for the discovery of dozens of unmarked graves on its property.\nAt Nickel, Elwood meets another young man named Turner (Brandon Wilson), who has a more cynical outlook on the civil rights movement that is unfolding at the time of their imprisonment. Ross frequently switches perspectives, not just between first-person and third-person framing (where the camera is locked to behind the character's head) but also between the viewpoints of Elwood and Turner, letting us see each character how their friend sees them and transforming our view of each in the process. Like the book, it also periodically checks in with an adult Elwood (Daveed Diggs) reckoning with what happened.\nRoss says that the camerawork in Nickel Boys is designed to reflect how every human being is the centre of their own world, but also how they experience the world in a way that they haven't yet processed. \"It's about giving the person \u2013 about giving Elwood \u2013 not the hindsight of ourselves, which is to look at things as if they're meaningful, but just to look at things that will become meaningful,\" he tells the BBC. \"So the narrative will always be secondary to the experience of looking.\"\nAwards Watch\nNickel Boys has been nominated for two Academy Awards. The film earned nods in the Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay categories. Nickel Boys is also nominated for a Bafta award in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. Click here for more on the films getting awards buzz.\nThe way in which Elwood and Turner's individual experiences are presented through the cameras \u2013 which were operated by Ross himself as well as cinematographer Jomo Fray and another cameraman, Sam Ellison, so they could each take breaks \u2013 includes movement mimicking that of a person's eyes; the characters voices' come from off screen, and you see their hands and feet, and sometimes their faces if they look at a reflective surface. Sometimes you really feel the restriction of their point of view, such as when they are getting chased and can't tell how far someone is behind them, or hear menacing noises around the corner in their racially segregated hometown.\nIn order to create that point of view, the practical requirements of shooting in first person were demanding, but also allowed for spontaneity. Ross and Fray did away with a lot of the traditional structuring and planning of shots, and things were adjusted depending on the scene.\nRoss says that \"the blocking became more gestural\" \u2013 more about considering what the character would be looking at, and how to make it so that body parts showed up in frame correctly, than it was about about traditional orchestration of how and where actors moved. For the filming of some of these point-of-view shots, the actor for the character whose eyes we are looking through wasn't even on set.\nNickel Boys isn't the first film to use first-person cinematography, but it's certainly the first mainstream film release to use it in such a profound way. In the past, it's a technique which has mostly been reserved for gimmicky horrors or action films that are often emulating first-person shooter video games \u2013 take for example 2017 Korean film The Villainess, or the (awful) 2015 sci-fi thriller Hardcore Henry.\nNickel Boys goes in the opposite direction to these types of films \u2013 instead of using the first-person point of view in service of pumped-up sensationalism, Ross is looking to throw out traditional narrative form and create something much more impressionistic. It's a striking choice, in particular, for a film based on a novel, when so often such adaptations rely on chunks of diaristic voiceover and rigid structure. Nickel Boys shows how offering a visual window into the things that a character pays attention to is as good as internal monologue in helping the audience to understand them.\nTo Ross, the choice to shoot a lot of the film from the first-person viewpoint seemed obvious. \"Why can't we get closer to our sensibility and subjectivity on screen,\" he asks. In particular, he says, adopting the first person POV \"seemed to me just to be an act that would be refreshing for black folks, to look up on the screen and see their hands are doing something in the world. For many years I've been like, 'Why has no one ever made [a film like] this?'\"\nRoss acknowledges that he is hardly the first filmmaker to use first person \u2013 he cites Harmony Korine's recent experimental action film Aggro Dr1ft (2023) \u2013 but it's the context in which he uses it which sets him apart. His editing collapses scenes together into something resembling stream-of-consciousness, and this experiential viewpoint feels especially significant when applied to Nickel Boys' subject matter: all too often, this era of American race relations and racism is depicted from the outside looking in.\n\"An original concept in the writing process was, 'What happened if you give Elwood and Turner a camera to make their own Hale County, right?'\" Ross says, referring to his acclaimed 2018 documentary Hale County This Morning, This Evening. That film, which made his name, was an extremely intimate, again impressionistic portrait of the black community in the Alabama town of Hale County, where Ross moved in 2009. \"Cameras weren't portable, obviously, they weren't digital in the 50s, 60s and 70s,\" Ross continues. \"And so no one would ever be able to gather enough footage to make something as poetic and as observational as that.\" With Nickel Boys, he and Fray wondered about \"how what people understand to be the image of black people [would] have changed if in the 60s people had access to show their point of view\".\nEllen Jones, journalist and author of Screen Deep: How Film and TV can Solve Racism and Save the World, praises the groundbreaking effect of the film's formal conceit. \"What is so exciting and impressive about Ross's use of the camera in Nickel Boys is that it demands we consider not just the story, but how the story is told,\" she says. \"The first-person position of the camera eliminates the voyeuristic distance from racist violence, which has been typical [in film], and inserts us in the subjectivity of the black characters. That fact that it feels immersive and never gimmicky is nothing short of miraculous.\"\nMore like this:\n \u2022 12 of the best films to watch in December\n\u2022 The 10 films getting early Oscar buzz\n \u2022 The powerful paintings reframing black experience\nThis first person perspective certainly makes it stand out from the many other films about the Jim Crow era: Jones points out how conventional dramas by white filmmakers, such as Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), Mississippi Burning (1988), Green Book (2018) and Hidden Figures (2016), are designed to speak to a presumed white audience by focusing on sensationalised images of black people in pain.\nRoss's break from a tradition of narrative presentation connects back to an appropriately freeform personal essay he wrote for Film Quarterly titled Renew The Encounter. It speaks of decoupling an idea of \"blackness\" from a commodified, mainstream American sensibility. This aim is reflected in Nickel Boys \u2013 as is the expressed desire to \"create the personal-poetic experience of blackness\". His films do this by taking minute everyday experience and expanding it into an entire visual world, aiming, as he puts it in Renew the Encounter, to \"bring elation to the experience of blackness\". Doing this and being honest about history is a delicate balance, but Nickel Boys achieves it: the suffering of its protagonists is included as an honest reflection of their lives, but its presentation is not the film's only goal.\nThe first-person perspective also naturally puts certain limits on what the camera is showing. Some things are missed purely because the eye can only see so much. Others are excluded because the character simply doesn't want to look, such as in one harrowing scene of corporal punishment in which Elwood avoids seeing what is happening to him, the camera's gaze moving to the ground. \u00a0As such, acts of physical violence often happen in the periphery of the frame \u2013 as Ross puts it, Elwood isn't there collecting evidence. \"No one's in the world to show black suffering at the time in which black suffering is happening,\" Ross says, elaborating on his choice. \"That's not the purpose of them being human in the world \u2013 it's just happening because of the larger context.\"\nLooking back at the basis of Hale County, Ross's manifesto for that film (as shared in Filmmaker Magazine) highlights the point: \"participate, not capture; shoot from not at.\" Nickel Boys might be the epitome of this method, as it shoots from behind its characters' very eyes. That \"participation\" is part of the simple reason why the film stands out from so many other depictions of the same period of troubled American history: it prioritises showing how black people live, not just what we have endured.\nNickel Boys is out now in US cinemas and in UK cinemas from 3 January\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nHe joined Manchester United at the age of seven.\nTwenty years, 426 appearances, 138 goals and five trophies later, Marcus Rashford has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nIt will seem strange to see Rashford - the boy from Wythenshawe, United through and through - wearing another team's strip.\nAs recently as November, the idea seemed fanciful.\nHow did we get here?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIn public, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim tried to counter the view that he wanted to jettison Rashford.\nBut United insiders believe the former Sporting boss felt it would be better for everyone if the forward was no longer around.\nEven towards the back end of last week, there was still hopeful talk of a resolution on Rashford's part. Now the reality is sinking in. Amorim has got his way.\nWhat has been very difficult to pinpoint, even though Amorim has given some frank interviews, is the detailed reasoning why the coach was so willing to let him leave.\nIt was all sparked when Amorim dropped Rashford for the Manchester derby on 15 December.\nThree days earlier, the forward had been substituted 11 minutes into the second half of what looked like being an embarrassing Europa League defeat by Czech side Viktoria Plzen.\nRasmus Hojlund came on to replace him and scored two goals to turn the match into a 2-1 win.\nRashford has been omitted from 11 of 12 squads since.\nThe one time he did make a squad - the 2-0 home Premier League defeat by Newcastle on 30 December - he was left on the bench. Afterwards, Amorim was asked why.\nWhen he had to address the subject again before Thursday's Europa League win over Romanian side FCSB, Amorim seemed as if he was starting to get irritated.\nThere is no doubt he has used the Rashford situation as a test of his strength. Sir Alex Ferguson, an illustrious predecessor, may well have approved.\n\"If the coach has no control, he will not last,\" Ferguson explained in a case study for Harvard Business School, published in the weeks after his retirement in 2013.\n\"You have to achieve a position of comprehensive control. Players must recognise that as the manager, you have the status to control events. Before I came to United, I told myself I wasn't going to allow anyone to be stronger than I was. Your personality has to be bigger than theirs.\"\nAmorim's latest comments on the Rashford saga were not as polished but the sentiment was the same.\n\"You [the media] want to make it personal,\" said Amorim. \"I have nothing against Marcus but I have to make the same rules for everybody.\"\nIt was more or less the same message Amorim delivered at the Etihad Stadium in dropping Rashford and forward Alejandro Garnacho for the Manchester derby win over City.\nIn various forms, it has been repeated at least half a dozen times in the interim.\n\"It's important, the performance in training, the performance in the games, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with your team-mates, the way you push your team-mates, everything is important in the context of beginning something, when we want to change a lot of things,\" Amorim outlined. \n\"It's the small details. When people in our club are losing their jobs, we have to put the standards really high.\"\nRashford scored three times in Amorim's first two league games, but hadn't been on the field for the last 12 matches\nRashford responded to that forceful assertion by using a visit to his old school to tell football writer Henry Winter he was ready for \"a new challenge\".\nThat was widely interpreted to mean the player wanted to leave. But sources close to Rashford explained that, as they understood it, he was voicing a general feeling of frustration rather than a desire to try something new.\nThey say he felt he was being eased out of a club he remained attached to - a club he felt he knew far better than those running it.\nClub sources say Rashford has trained well. Unlike Jadon Sancho, who fell out with former United boss Erik ten Hag, again over standards, Rashford was not banished to a different area of the Carrington training ground and told to change on his own.\nWhile Rashford's body language has not always presented the most positive image, recent open training showed a different side.\nDuring the 15-minute sessions broadcast before the Europa League matches against Rangers and FCSB, Rashford was expressive and light-hearted.\nWhen Amorim 'ran the gauntlet' through the first-team squad to mark his 40th birthday, Rashford was among those in the line, smiling after the United boss had charged through.\nThis video can not be played\nMarcus Rashford's best Premier League goals\nIt has never been plain sailing for Rashford at United.\nA succession of managers have felt at times they were not getting the most out of a player with blinding speed, excellent balance and an eye for goal.\nFor the 2022-23 season, the first under Ten Hag, Rashford was diligent, going to the United States for personal sessions to ensure he was ready to go when the real preparations began.\nThe reward was a career-high 30 goals. It is a strike rate no-one else in the United squad can match and is the chief reason why representatives spent time visiting some of European football's biggest clubs - Barcelona, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund - gauging interest and trying to work out what kind of a deal was possible before the transfer window closed.\nBut was the goals output confirmation of Rashford's talent or the exception amid more mediocre returns in recent times?\nThe season before, he found the net twice in his final 28 appearances. Since August 2023, he has scored 15 in total. The drop-off is alarming. Even sources close to the 27-year-old accept he is not playing well.\nHowever, despite missing the past 11 games, he is still United's joint-fourth highest scorer this season with seven, the same as \u00a372m signing Hojlund, who has played four more games.\nOnly Amad Diallo (six), Bruno Fernandes (five) and Hojlund (four) have scored more goals under Amorim than Rashford (three), who has only been on the pitch in 35% of the new head coach's games at United.\nUnited's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney has told Rashford in private he should leave. It is an observation he offered to a wider audience on The Overlap podcast.\n\"I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times,\" he said. \"I've given him my thoughts. I've said: You need to leave the football club.\n\"I went into Carrington to take my kids to game day and Marcus was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games. I remember looking at him thinking: How embarrassing is it that the parents are walking past?\"\nRooney's former United team-mate Rio Ferdinand used similar terms to describe how he would feel if a manager had called out his training performances as Amorim had to Rashford.\n\"My heart, my pride, my ego. It's embarrassment,\" Ferdinand said.\n\"For someone to question you giving 100% for the team, saying you're lacking effort and taking shortcuts: That's a damning comment. There's no way back for Marcus after that.\"\nThe mural on the side of a cafe in Withington, south Manchester, was created by a street artist in tribute after Rashford's campaign to extend free school meals during the coronavirus pandemic\nOne theory floated by a source with an understanding of the workings at Old Trafford pointed to financial matters.\nRashford and Casemiro - who has not been omitted from Amorim's squad like the England man but has played only three times since the Plzen game - are by far United's highest earners. The theory is their presence makes it difficult for United to get their profligacy in the transfer market under control.\nIf they left, representatives of prospective signings would be unable to use them as a benchmark for wage negotiations.\nConsequently, it is not until those salaries are off the books that United can properly start to move forward in a more sustainable manner, without the threat of profit and sustainability breaches hanging over them. Those rules also feed the view that homegrown stars such as Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo might need to be sold.\nUnited have grown used to subsidising moves for highly paid players who are not reaching the standards required and no longer wanted by the manager of the day. Their wage bill is one of the highest in world football. Few would say United have been getting value for money.\nAlexis Sanchez, Donny van de Beek, Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Sancho have all fallen into that bracket.\nRashford is the next one out, with United believing they have done well to negotiate a deal that, they say, covers 75% of his wages.\nSources close to the player were adamant the interest in him was huge.\nThere were offers from the Saudi Pro-League, but he felt accepting might mean abandoning his England career.\nA big ambition was to join Barcelona, but they needed to offload players to make it happen. That scenario never materialised into anything close to reality.\nSo Villa, emboldened financially by the \u00a371m sale of Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr, made their pitch.\nThere is plenty about the switch that makes sense. Villa's status is currently greater than that of United. They are pushing for a top-five slot, despite Saturday's defeat at Wolves, and have a Champions League last-16 game in March to look forward to. Unai Emery needs someone who can play through the centre, if required, or in a wide slot. Although he prefers to be on the left, Rashford can do all of this.\nEmery, it is being stressed, was a huge selling point. On a personal level, Rashford doesn't need to move house. \nSo the lifelong Manchester United fan, who felt so entwined with his team, will now wear the claret and blue of Villa, at least until the end of the season. \nAs for Amorim, he has made the big call. He no longer has to answer questions about a player who belongs to another club.\nBut he needs to deliver success himself. If he doesn't, and Rashford does well, he will be in a very uncomfortable position.",

        "article_text": "A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country.\nThe properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board.\nThe new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion.\nOn 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders.\nThey claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation.\nThe new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.\nBut several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.\nA vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.\nThe tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.\nThe properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.\nThe government says that the waqf boards are among India\u2019s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).\nMuslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. \nBut critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies \u2013 which too requires immediate attention.\nA report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. \nThe committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.\nThe committee also noted that \u201cencroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common\u201d, listing hundreds of instances of such \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d of waqf land by government authorities.\nAccording to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.\nThe amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.\nParliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.\nBut many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.\nMany of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.\nThe 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.\nProfessor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.\n\u201cYou can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,\u201d Prof Rehman says.\nOthers worry that the new bill may not address the community\u2019s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.\nThat's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. \nSome agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. \nBut the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. \u201cThere seems to be an attempt not only to get the state\u2019s control over Muslims\u2019 properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community\u2019s lives.\u201d\nAmong other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf\u2019s claim to a property is valid.\nCritics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.\nThe current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.\nBut some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. \n\"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,\u201d Owaisi recently told reporters.\nThis process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.\n\u201cThe diagnosis may be correct,\u201d Prof Rehman says, \u201cbut the treatment is not.\u201d",

There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).Getty ImagesWaqf properties include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of landIs there a need for reform?Muslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land.",

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. \n\"I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences.\"",

        "article_text": "This ancient snack is synonymous with Tibetan New Year and will soon be prepared by millions of families.\nAt the entrance of the Kemgun Gumba monastery in Lukla, Nepal, an indigo-blue sign reads \"dining\". Inside, nearly a dozen women and a few men are hard at work, hunched over long tables, deftly mixing, rolling and slicing dough into thin rectangular strips. Each strip is slit in the middle, and one side of the dough is pulled into a ribbon-like bow. The rhythmic pounding of dough punctuates the crackle of oil sizzling in a large vessel outside, as boys and girls transform the doughy strips into deep-fried khapse (kha zas\u00a0in Tibetan), a sweet, crunchy snack central to Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists.\n\"Kha means 'mouth', and sey means 'snack',\" said chef Yeshi Jampa, co-author of the book Taste Tibet and founder of the eponymous Taste Tibet restaurant in Oxford. \"It's a symbol of [Tibetan] New Year,\" or Losar, he added.\nEvery year, millions of Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, India and elsewhere celebrate Losar (lo\u00a0means \"year\" and\u00a0gsar means \"new\"). The 15-day festival (which starts 28 February 2025) occurs on the first day of the Tibetan Lunar calendar and celebrates renewal and new beginnings. The first three days of the festival are considered the most important when followers visit monasteries, offer ceremonial scarves, receive blessings from Rinpoches (respected Tibetan teachers or lamas) and prepare special dishes with friends and family \u2013 especially khapse.\nEating khapse on Losar is thought to bring warmth, peace and tranquillity in the new year, and preparing it is both an art and a labour-intensive process. The dough (made of wheat flour, butter, sugar and oil with an optional egg) is kneaded, rolled and shaped into designs like flowers, knots and braids before being and fried in ghee (clarified butter).\nAccording to Geshema Delek Dolma, a nun at Dolma Ling Nunnery in northern India's Himachal Pradesh state, the history of khapse is intertwined with early Bon rituals \u2013 the indigenous religion practised across the Tibetan plateau before the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th Century CE \u2013 where blood offerings were made to deities.\n\"[Instead] of animal sacrifice, the custom evolved into offering khapse, which was sometimes coloured red as a symbolic gesture,\" Dolma said. \"The practice eventually spread to the other two provinces [Amdo and Kham] of\u00a0Tibet.\"\nKhapse-making is a communal activity.Itrequires many hands to prepare the honey-golden pastries in large quantities so it can be distributed to friends, family and across the community. So in the days ahead of Losar, family members come together to prepare large batches of khapse.\n\"It depends on how much quantity [of khapse] you have to make,\" said Kanchhi Maya Sherpa, who runs the Hotel Sherwi Hyul in Kathmandu. \"It's impossible for one [or] two people to make it as we need to knead the mixture together for a long time. Working together in the Gumba [monastery] is community work.\"\nFollowers first offer khapse to the deities as part of their religious practice, and afterwards, the crunchy treat is shared with others, including the poor, as a means of charity. \"This is always the tradition because Tibetans believe in the service of others before self,\" said Jampa.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Chhurpi: The world's hardest cheese?\n\u2022 The world's higest train line\n\u2022 After 100 hours in Tibet, I knew it was time to leave\nAs Jamyang Norbu, author of the book Echoes From Forgotten Mountains, notes on his blog, the first piece of khapse isn't actually eaten or offered. Instead, it's customary to shape the dough in a scorpion-shaped cookie, fry it and then place it outside the kitchen until \"the 15th day of the New Year to ward off bad luck and possible accidents that could take place during the [khapse]-making\".\n\"Traditionally, it was believed that making khapse could predict success for the upcoming year,\" explained Dolma. For example, oil spilling during the frying process was considered a bad omen. Jampa recalled an accident from his childhood that ruined his family's New Year celebrations. \"[It meant] evil,\" he said, noting how preparing the snack is steeped in cultural beliefs.\nKhapse recipes and the shapes the snack takes vary across regions and families. In Tibet's Markam County, where Jampa grew up, khapse was traditionally sweetened with organic honey from their beehives instead of sugar. Khapse made with honey \"makes the biscuit a little softer\", he explained. \"The sweetness of honey-made khapse arrives more slowly.\" In contrast, recipes that call for sugar have a crunchier texture.\n\"Different parts of Tibet mould khapse differently [and] in different shapes,\" Jampa said. \"I am from Kham. In my village, we make less ornate\u00a0khapse, known as\u00a0kong-chen \u2013 a narrow rectangular piece of dough with a cut in the middle through which one side of the\u00a0khapse\u00a0is pulled through.\" Another style, the hrug-hrug, \"are basically just small rectangles or triangles of dough that require no further work\", Jampa explained.\nKhapse is also deeply connected to Buddhist rituals. During Losar, flowers, fruits, grains, nuts, salt, butter and water are placed on the altar, as offerings to deities, alongside stacks of khapse arranged in towers called derga.\n\"Derga khapses are different shapes, compared to the khapses that we eat,\" my Tibetan friend, Tenzin Diki, told me. \"We add khapse in the shape of a crescent moon and a sun on the derga. We also add beautiful kharu (smaller, ornately designed pieces of khapse) on the derga, and decorate it with chhurpi [traditional cheese], sweets [and] rock sugar.\"\nToday, these fried cookies have evolved in style and shape and are eaten throughout the year. Khapse is sold year-round at stores in Kathmandu and many families prepare it as a snack outside of Losar. A quick online search for \"khapse\" or \"khapsey\" shows legions of home chefs and food bloggers experimenting with moulding the cookies and preparing them with additional ingredients like banana, beetroot, spinach and more.\n\"These days, people have modernised khapse, using their creativity, adding motifs to shape it differently,\" Sherpa explained. \"The shapes now depend on how much creativity one has. You can make it in any shape you want.\"\nYet, not everyone embraces these innovations. \"We have to keep traditional things traditional,\" said Jampa. \"[Khapse] is a special ceremony snack, a symbol of family effort and [it] reminds us that it is something special.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Winter isn't all bad \u2013 these \"sublime\" landscapes of the frozen North from the turn of the 20th Century offer us a way into resilience \u2013 and an \"acceptance of the seasonality of life\".\nWith its bare trees, long nights and icy temperatures, it's perhaps unsurprising that, culturally in the Northern Hemisphere, we seem so conditioned to complain about winter. Yet, as the author Katherine May points out in her 2020 book Wintering, winter is also a valuable time for rest and retreat. \"Winter offers us liminal spaces to inhabit,\" she writes. Its \"starkness\", she argues, re-sensitises us, and \"can reveal colours that we would otherwise miss\".\nFor Nordic countries, where, in some regions, the season can last more than six months, making peace with winter is a necessity, with concepts such as the Norwegian friluftsliv\u00a0(embracing the natural world) and the Danish hygge (hunkering down with simple comforts) offering fresh perspectives on cold weather.\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, the frozen North \u2013 with its vast fjords, mystical boreal forests and radiant light \u2013 became a powerful muse for artists such as Hilma af Klint, Edvard Munch and Harald Sohlberg. These artists immersed themselves in these cold climates, and developed a specifically Nordic style of painting imbued with their emotional responses to the landscape. Around 70 of these intensely atmospheric, expressionist works by artists from Scandinavia, Finland and Canada are being showcased in a new exhibition, Northern Lights, a cross-Atlantic collaboration that debuts at the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, before travelling to New York's Buffalo AKG Art Museum in August.\nIt was natural that these painters should be drawn to these wintery scenes, Ulf K\u00fcster, the exhibition's curator, tells the BBC. \"In Nordic landscapes, snow is a very dominant factor of life from October to late April\u2026 It's just this massive presence of white and nature and wilderness and vastness that really defines this landscape, and I think these painters have found a very interesting response to that.\" This burst of Nordic landscape painting was also a response to the changes that the painters perceived as a result of population growth and industrialisation. \"There was a big desire in the late 19th Century to return to pure nature and the simple life,\" explains K\u00fcster. \"You had these highly industrialised countries and pollution, and the pureness of white snow must have been quite a contrast.\" \u00a0\nMany of these northern regions were comparatively untouched by change, and featured vast, unpopulated vistas that were inherently painterly. Even today, Norway has a population of just 5.5 million, but a length of around 1,600km; while around three-quarters of Finland is still forested. To convey this scale, these paintings often adopt unconventional compositions where the view appears to stretch beyond the canvas. They are \"boundless\", says K\u00fcster. \"They don't have borders\". This is reinforced by the bird's-eye view adopted in works such as View from Pyynikki Ridge (1900) by the Finnish artist Helmi Biese. \"It's as if the artists have used a drone,\" remarks K\u00fcster.\nThe height and scope of these unpopulated views also convey a sense of isolation and loneliness. Harald Sohlberg, whose luminescent 1914 version of Winter Night in the Mountains is widely considered to be the national painting of Norway, wrote: \"The longer I stood gazing at the scene, the more I seemed to feel what a solitary and pitiful atom I was in an endless universe\u2026 It was as if I had suddenly awakened in a new, unimagined and inexplicable world\u2026 Above the white contours of a northern winter stretched the endless vault of heaven, twinkling with myriads of stars. It was like a service in some vast cathedral.\"\u00a0\nIt was this search for solitude that doubtless drew the Swedish artist Anna Boberg to the Norwegian archipelago of Lofoten, a remote location steeped in Viking folklore and, according to her 1901 memoir, \"the apotheosis of Arctic beauty and wilderness\". It was here, dressed head-to-toe in seal and reindeer fur, that she produced her Northern Lights (1901) painting, most likely sketched en plein air. In a commanding scene that speaks to the Romantic notion of \"the sublime\", prismatic streaks of light descend from the heavens dwarfing the snowy landscape.\nBoberg's awe when confronted with this dazzling wintry world with its unique light is clear. \"What really drove these people was to find a response to the extremities of nature \u2013 the very essence of snow, winter and ice.\" explains K\u00fcster. To achieve this, they would \"get as close to nature as possible\", he says. Far from hiding from the harsh winter, Boberg and her contemporaries immersed themselves in the landscape. \"They are painters who really wanted to paint the experience, to feel the extreme temperature and the snow blindness,\" says K\u00fcster. Munch, he continues, had outdoor studios, and would leave his paintings outside \"just to let nature test them\", while some of the Canadian painters would paddle out on to lakes and paint from their canoes. \u00a0\nInland, the boreal forest embodied the enchanting duality of these landscapes, which were both beautiful and barbaric. The dark, primeval forests became an emblem of foreboding in Nordic folklore and myth \u2013 places where you could get lost, and that concealed unknown dangers. The Nordic winter landscape fed the fairytales of the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. \"Below them the wind blew cold, wolves howled, and black crows screamed as they skimmed across the glittering snow,\" he writes in The Snow Queen (1844). \"But up above, the moon shone bright and large.\"\nThis storybook quality can be seen in Winter Moonlight (1895) by the Swedish painter Gustaf Fjaestad. Here, his clever use of pointillism makes the snow appear to glitter, while the hand-like branches of the dense, drooping trees look poised to come alive. In The Lair of the Lynx (1908), Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a Finn, also revels in this tantalising, darker side to the landscape, inviting us to scan the canvas for the dark places beasts may be lurking, and to follow their tracks in the snow.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eight nature books to change your life\n\u2022\u00a0The climate warnings in 19th-Century paintings\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nNotable, also, is the power and movement he gives to the snow as it winds in thick layers around the trees. \"The brushwork of this painting meticulously reacts to the layers of snow,\" says K\u00fcster. \"It's snowing, then it's freezing, there might be some sun and there's a little thaw, and then there's freezing again and more snow comes on top.\" The painter is clearly entranced by the snow, the layers of paint telling the snow's story. The visual effect, observes K\u00fcster, is \"like a sort of wedding cake\".\nAs well as drawing inspiration from the landscape's mythical associations, these artists participated in their own myth-making, expressing \u2013 through their own strong emotional responses to these unspoilt regions \u2013 an often idealised view of the Nordic winter. Some, such as Edvard Munch, nevertheless hinted at the changes threatening these serene expanses. During the winter of 1900, he stayed in Nordstrand on the banks of the Oslofjord. Here he painted his now-famous rendition of its serene waters reflecting a magnificent sky of pink, blue and yellow. But this picturesque, swirling scene, foregrounded by pines, is interrupted by a bulbous trail of white paint, denoting, not snow this time, but, as the title makes clear, Train Smoke.\n\"When we look back at the landscape works of Gallen-Kallela and Biese, we are reminded of how much of the environment has changed in the intervening century,\" writes Anna-Maria Pennonen in her essay Changing Landscapes in the exhibition catalogue. \"The Baltic Sea no longer freezes every winter, and the period when the ground is covered with snow in Helsinki can be very short, perhaps only a few weeks instead of months.\" As for the magnificent boreal forest, it continues to be threatened by logging and agriculture.\nRecognising the mutability of these environments now adds a powerful new dimension when a modern audience engages with these 100-year-old works. \"They ask us to think about the enchanting image of the forest in relation to its past and current transformation, as well as in relation to our own part therein,\" writes Helga Christoffersen in the catalogue. The works invite feelings of nostalgia and melancholy, and our appreciation that they are endangered only amplifies their beauty and psychological intensity.\nDanish artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen, born in 1987, addresses this issue of climate change in Boreal Dreams (2024), an interactive, immersive work and online experience, commissioned for Northern Lights. The work uses virtual reality to connect past, present and future boreal ecosystems. It takes visitors on a journey into five imagined futures for the boreal forest, marrying technology with environmental data to create a visceral experience of nature. Yet, however bleak the future seems, raw nature \u2013 \u00a0these works suggest \u2013 can offer something transcendent. \"We like to think that it's possible for life to be one eternal summer,\" writes May in Wintering. \"But life's not like that.\" By confronting and reframing winter, as these artists do, we can accept the seasonality of life, and cope better with the dark periods of our life. \"Winter had blanked me, blasted me wide open,\" she declares. \"In all that whiteness, I saw the chance to make myself new again.\"\u00a0\nNorthern Lights is at the Fondation Beyeler in Riehen/Basel in Switzerland until 25 May and at Buffalo AKG Art Museum, Buffalo, New York, from 1 August 2025 to 12 January 2026.

        "summary": "Its \"starkness\", she argues, re-sensitises us, and \"can reveal colours that we would otherwise miss\".Finnish National Gallery/ Alteneum Art MuseumView from Pyynikki Ridge (1900) by Helmi Biese, depicts a bird's-eye view of the Finnish boreal forest (Credit: Finnish National Gallery/ Alteneum Art Museum)For Nordic countries, where, in some regions, the season can last more than six months, making peace with winter is a necessity, with concepts such as the Norwegian friluftsliv\u00a0(embracing the natural world) and the Danish hygge (hunkering down with simple comforts) offering fresh perspectives on cold weather.At the turn of the 20th Century, the frozen North \u2013 with its vast fjords, mystical boreal forests and radiant light \u2013 became a powerful muse for artists such as Hilma af Klint, Edvard Munch and Harald Sohlberg. The visual effect, observes K\u00fcster, is \"like a sort of wedding cake\".Courtesy of the Faurschou CollectionThe Lair of the Lynx (1908) by Akseli Gallen-Kallela is featured in the exhibition Northern Lights at Fondation Beyeler, Basel (Credit: Courtesy of the Faurschou Collection)As well as drawing inspiration from the landscape's mythical associations, these artists participated in their own myth-making, expressing \u2013 through their own strong emotional responses to these unspoilt regions \u2013 an often idealised view of the Nordic winter. \"In Nordic landscapes, snow is a very dominant factor of life from October to late April\u2026 It's just this massive presence of white and nature and wilderness and vastness that really defines this landscape, and I think these painters have found a very interesting response to that.\" But this picturesque, swirling scene, foregrounded by pines, is interrupted by a bulbous trail of white paint, denoting, not snow this time, but, as the title makes clear, Train Smoke.However bleak the future seems, raw nature \u2013 these works suggest \u2013 can offer something transcendent\"When we look back at the landscape works of Gallen-Kallela and Biese, we are reminded of how much of the environment has changed in the intervening century,\" writes Anna-Maria Pennonen in her essay Changing Landscapes in the exhibition catalogue. Around 70 of these intensely atmospheric, expressionist works by artists from Scandinavia, Finland and Canada are being showcased in a new exhibition, Northern Lights, a cross-Atlantic collaboration that debuts at the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, before travelling to New York's Buffalo AKG Art Museum in August.It was natural that these painters should be drawn to these wintery scenes, Ulf K\u00fcster, the exhibition's curator, tells the BBC.",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

        "article_text": "Despite the hype, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Washington under Donald Trump's second term was a sober, business-first affair - unsurprising for a working visit, which lacks the pomp of a state visit.\nTrump announced expanded US military sales to India from 2025, including F-35 jets, along with increased oil and gas exports to narrow the trade deficit. Both sides agreed to negotiate a trade deal and finalise a new defence framework. \nHe also confirmed the US had approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman accused of playing a role in the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai.\n\"That's a lot of deliverables for an administration less than a month old,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington told the BBC\n\"Overall, both sides seem comfortable continuing Biden-era collaborations, particularly in tech and defence, though many will be rebranded under Trump.\"\nStill, major challenges lie ahead. Here are the key takeaways:\nModi's visit came as Trump ordered that US trading partners should face reciprocal tariffs - tit-for-tat import taxes to match similar duties already charged by those countries on American exports. He ordered advisers to draft broad new tariffs on US trade partners, warning they could take effect by 1 April.\nIndia enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. India cut average tariffs from 13% to 11% in its federal budget in a bid to pre-empt Trump's tariff moves. \nThe jury is out on whether India appears to have dodged tariff shocks for now.\nAjay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI), says he doesn't see any \"problems with tariffs\".\nThe main reason, he says, is that 75% of the US exports to India attract import taxes of less than 5%.\n\"Trump points to extreme outlier tariffs like 150% on select items, but that's not the norm. India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.\nAbhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced.\n\"The devil lies in the details. Reciprocal tariffs won't just mirror India's import taxes -other factors will come into play,\" he told the BBC.\nTrump's approach could go beyond import duties, factoring in value added tax (VAT), non-tariff barriers and trade restrictions. While India's goods and services tax (GST) on imported goods aligns with WTO rules, Trump may still use it to justify higher tariffs.\nA US government memo on reciprocal tariffs hints at this strategy, citing costs to American businesses from non-tariff barriers, subsidies and burdensome regulations abroad. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.\nMr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected under WTO rules. \n\"This will hamper India's ability to prioritise domestic producers, posing a direct challenge to the 'Make in India' initiative. This is certainly not good news for us.\" \nMr Das suggests that India should counter Trump's reciprocal tariff logic, particularly in agriculture where the US imposes strict non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian exports such as stiff maximum residue limits on chemicals. \nHe argues that since the US \"heavily subsidises\" its farm sector, India should highlight these subsidies to push back against American claims.\nTariffs alone may not help bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. Defence and energy purchases will go some way in addressing the deficit, experts say.\nThe new $500bn (\u00a3400bn) trade goal aims to more than double the $190bn trade between the two countries in 2023.\nModi and Trump committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. Talks will focus on market access, tariff reductions and supply chain integration across goods and services.\n\"The announcement that the two sides will pursue a trade deal gives India an opportunity to negotiate for reduced tariffs on both sides. That would be a boon not only for the US-India relationship, but also for an Indian economy that's sputtered in recent months,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nWhat is not clear is what kind of trade deal the both sides will be aiming at.\n\"What is this trade agreement? Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?\" wonders Mr Srivastava. \nMr Das believes we'll have to wait for details on the trade agreement. \n\"It doesn't necessarily mean a free trade deal - if that were the case, it would have been stated explicitly. It could simply involve tariff reductions on select products of mutual interest.\"\nPriyanka Kishore, principal economist at the Singapore-based consultancy firm, Asia Decoded, says $500bn is a \"tall target but there are low hanging fruit we can immediately exploit\".\n\"For instance the US sanctions on Russian shadow fleet are soon going to kick in, so India can easily pivot to the US for more oil. This will not be too difficult.\"\nTrump said at the joint press conference that the US would hopefully become India's number one supplier of oil and gas. \nIndia's defence trade with the US has surged from near zero to $20 billion, making the US its third-largest arms supplier. \nWhile Russia remains India's top source, its share has dropped from 62% to 34% (2017-2023) as India shifts toward US procurement.\nIn a major announcement to deepen defence ties, Trump said the US would increase military equipment sales to India \"by many billions of dollars starting this year\" ultimately paving the way to providing the F-35 stealth warplanes.\nBut this will be easier said than done, say experts.\n\"This sounds good, but it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nDespite rising US arms sales to India, bureaucratic hurdles and export controls limit the transfer of sensitive technologies, he says. The new defence framework announced at the summit may help address these challenges.\nAlso India isn't \"taking the F-35 offer seriously\" due to high maintenance demands, says strategic affairs expert Ajai Shukla. \nShukla notes that US arms deals come with challenges - private firms prioritise profit over long-term partnerships. \nYet with delays and cost overruns affecting some of India's arms deals with Russia, Delhi's defence ties with the US look set to deepen.\nModi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss AI and emerging tech, India's foreign ministry said.\nIt's unclear if they addressed Musk's stalled plans for Starlink's India launch or Tesla's market entry. \nMusk has pushed for direct spectrum allocation, clashing with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who favours auctions. His licence remains under review.\nIndia is also courting Tesla to set up a car factory, cutting EV import taxes for automakers committing $500m and local production within three years. Tesla has yet to confirm its plans.\nIn a rare move, Modi joined Trump at a press conference, answering two questions - on illegal immigration and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) bribery charges against the Adani Group.\nIndian billionaire Gautam Adani, accused of close ties with Modi, was charged with fraud in the US last November over an alleged $250m bribery scheme. \nModi said he hadn't discussed the issue with Trump. On immigration, he stated India was ready to take back verified illegal Indian migrants.\nThis was only Modi's third direct press Q&A in his almost 11-year tenure as India's prime minister. He has never held a solo press conference. In 2019 he sat beside then party president Amit Shah as Shah answered all the questions and in 2023, he took just two questions alongside former President Joe Biden.",

        "article_text": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music \u2013 with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.\nIf asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The radical trend millennials love\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forgotten Soviet genius of music\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?\nThere are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and \u2013 just as vitally \u2013 new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.\nUnsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag \"classictok\" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.\nFor French violinist Esther Abrami \u2013 who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards \u2013 the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. \"I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,\" Abrami tells BBC Culture.\nShe noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. \"I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,\" she enthuses. \"It opened this door to a completely new world.\"\nNigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fan Babatunde Akinboboye enjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. \"I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,\" he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. \"But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,\" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of \"hip-hopera\" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.\nBoth Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. \"I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,\" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts \u2013 taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery \u00a0\u2013 have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. \"It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,\" he explains. \"Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.\"\n'Complex and profound'\nAbrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: \"I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.\"\n\u00a0\nBritish concert pianist Harriet Stubbs is another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple 20-minute concerts from her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. \"I gave 250 concerts,\" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. \"I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.\"\nThe fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. \"I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,\" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a \"Bowie meets Rachmaninoff\" affair.\nInterestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia \u2013 dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery \u2013 both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub J\u00f3zef Orli\u0144ski, meanwhile, uses atmospheric visuals as a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, which The New York Times describes as \"resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos\".\n\"I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums \u2013 the narrative, the photography, the videos,\" Orli\u0144ski tells BBC Culture. \"I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,\" he adds. This is certainly something Orli\u0144ski has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, he wowed critics with his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was \"an incredible experience\" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. \"Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul \u2013 a pop song won't work.\"\nClassical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK's National Youth Orchestra have just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of \"the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager\".\nOrli\u0144ski agrees that classical music has achieved an \"almost hipstery\" status of late. \"It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,\" he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as \"people like Yuja Wang\" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. \"We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward.\" Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. \"I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,\" he concludes. \"[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing. And it'll work out, because audiences are ready.\"\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature. If we aren't, well, we probably don't really believe something is inherently better because it's natural.\nMeanwhile, there are hundreds of things that we might consider not to be natural that, in fact, have made life quite a lot better for many of us. Prior to modern medicine, more than one in 100 women died in childbirth. In wealthy, industrialised countries such as the UK today, it is more like one in 10,000. Before vaccinations were rolled out globally, whooping cough (pertussis) killed one out of every 10 children infected. After the global roll-out, deaths fell to a fraction \u2013 1/157, specifically \u2013 of what they had been before.\nThat's just medicine. Look around you right now, and you'll see a dozen more examples. It's may not be \"natural\" to wear glasses, refrigerate food, or turn on the heating in winter, for example \u2013 but for many of us, it's a better alternative than walking around near-blind, leaving meat to spoil or shivering in the cold.\nMuch of the food we eat does not come to us as nature presents it. We process and cook it. The harvesting, grinding and processing of grains helped to drive the transition of our species from being nomadic hunter gatherers into settled farmers capable of building sophisticated civilisations. So, too, did the way in which we cultivated and cross-bred crops \u2013 meaning that many of the nutritious foods we consider \"natural\" today, from the orange carrot to the modern banana, look (and taste) far different than their wild forebears.\nOf course, it would be wrong to suggest that human-made products don't also cause us problems, whether pollution from synthetic plastics to the use of guns and explosives. Nor does it mean that, in many cases, the more \"natural\" option is not better for us. But it does mean that we cannot assume the more \"natural\" option is better just because it's natural \u2013 despite a frequent tendency for people to believe the contrary. Carrots might be better for us than crisps, but so too is paracetamol versus arsenic.\nSome of these examples hint at one of the other main problems with the \"appeal to nature\" \u2013 how can you delineate what is, and what isn't, natural at all? Humans, after all, come from nature. So, if anything an animal or plant produces is \"natural\", why isn't anything that humans do? And what of those creations that are blends of what we'd traditionally consider natural and man-made \u2013 like vaccinations, which are derived from the parts of a (natural) virus or bacteria, and, when injected, help teach your immune system how to (naturally) fend off that same pathogen in the future?\n\"Like all truly interesting words, 'nature' is a mille-feuille of meanings,\" writes the science historian Lorraine Daston. It can mean almost anything, depending on the context. This slipperiness, of course, is exactly what makes it such clever language for marketing \u2013 and makes it so easy for us to fall for.\nThere's another problem, too: even if there were a clear-cut delineation between \"humans\" and \"nature\", we're often not very good at knowing what is actually synthetic, versus what is not.\nTake brushing our teeth. Is it natural to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste? What about to brush your teeth with a non-fluoride toothpaste?\nFor many of us, our instinct might be to say that brushing with fluoride is unnatural, while brushing with non-fluoride toothpaste is natural. But fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that can be found in soil, water and rocks, while one of its common replacements in \"natural\" toothpastes, nano-hydroxyapatite, is synthetic. And, of course, we'd need to consider that cleaning one's teeth, certainly with the items we use today, is far from natural; the closest primates get to brushing their teeth is \"flossing\" with whatever is on hand (like bird feathers). Even if we wanted to brush our teeth the way that our human ancestors did, we'd need to scrub our teeth with a twig, pig hairs or even porcupine quills.\nMeanwhile, if I told you that I had made a drink for you that was made up of 99% dihydrogen monoxide, would you recoil? This chemical name sounds pretty synthetic, after all, until you think about it.\nDihydrogen monoxide is, of course, two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. You might be more familiar to see it written in chemical shorthand: H2O. In other words, water.\nThe next time you see a product being marketed on the basis that it is natural \u2013 or see someone arguing against something because it is not \u2013 it is worth questioning what is really being meant. And, perhaps, questioning why it is that those behind the product or practice are leaning on the \"appeal to nature\" fallacy to persuade an audience of its merits \u2013 rather than simply laying out the logical argument for just why it is actually the better option.\n* Amanda Ruggeri is an award-winning science and features journalist.

        "article_text": "With her sultry drawl and feline charisma, the singer and actor oozed sophistication. But Eartha Kitt, who was born on 17 January 1927, had the toughest of childhoods. In History looks at how she transcended her troubled beginnings to become a star of stage and screen \u2013 and the first black Catwoman.\nCelebrated by Orson Welles as the \"most exciting woman in the world\", and smeared by the CIA as a \"sadistic nymphomaniac\", Eartha Kitt had an extraordinary life and career. After joining Katherine Dunham's pioneering African-American dance company, she was on Broadway by the age of 19, and went on to become a cabaret sensation in London and Paris. Her smouldering 1950s performances of songs such as Santa Baby, Just an Old-Fashioned Girl and I Want to be Evil have never been bettered. In 1967, she wowed mainstream television audiences as Catwoman in the third series of the camp classic Batman. Later, she won a new generation of fans as the villain Yzma in Disney's 2000 cartoon The Emperor's New Groove. She died on Christmas Day in 2008, aged 81.\nBorn Eartha Mae Keith on a South Carolina cotton plantation on 17 January 1927, she had a start in life that could hardly have been more difficult. She never knew her father, and her mother left her to be raised by various relatives. Speaking on BBC Wales' Late Call in 1971, she said: \"I remember at times when we didn't have anything to eat for what seemed like an insurmountable amount of time. We had to rely on the forest and whatever we could dig out of the ground, such as weeds or a grass I remember that had a kind of onion growing at the bottom of it. And when we could find things like that to eat then we were alright.\"\nDescribing her childhood self as an \"urchin\", she said: \"I'm very glad that she will always be a part of me because she helps me do what she knows I have to do out there on that stage.\"\nDespite being such a confident and poised performer, raw emotion was never far from the surface when Kitt was interviewed, as shown when Ronnie Williams, the host of Late Call, read her one of her quotes: \"You said, 'My mother gave me away at the age of five, and if my mother gives me away, she doesn't want me. So why should anybody want me?'\" Kitt replied that because of this abandonment, she had always lived with the feeling \"that the most important person in the world didn't want you\". She added: \"I think there are many explanations I can make for my mother giving me away and I think that, even though I have tried to explain within myself as to why she gave me away, it's still very difficult for me to accept it.\"\nDecades later, Kitt's beloved daughter Kitt Shapiro revealed that the singer died without knowing the identity of her white father. She told the Observer in 2013 that her mother wept when she finally saw her birth certificate, only to discover that the man's name had been blanked out by officials to protect his reputation in the segregated American South.\nBecause of her mixed heritage, Kitt told Williams on Late Call that she was not accepted by the black community. She said: \"They don't understand that I don't think of myself in terms of being a black person. I think of myself as being a person who belongs to everybody, but I think one should always feel this way. I think that, as long as you are feeling in terms of belonging only to one race, one nationality, one religion, that you have to be prejudiced\u2026 I am an illegitimate child, and at the same time I was not of completely black parentage. My father was supposedly a Caucasian, and my grandparents are Cherokee Indians. My mother was half black and all of this, and therefore my blood is of yours and of anybody's and therefore I've always thought of myself as this, and to be prejudiced against any of the other bloods is rather silly to me.\"\nIN HISTORY\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nAccording to Kitt, her travels had convinced her that financial inequality was at the root of so much prejudice around the world: \"When we are able to recognise that no matter what colour or religion you belong to, that you are capable of gaining as much as the next person can, no matter what race or religion he belongs to, I think the situation would be much healthier.\"\nThe singer and actor was being interviewed on BBC Wales to promote her week-long residency at the Double Diamond Club in Caerphilly, a scenic town near Cardiff. While the popular venue did in its time host big stars such as Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash, it was still a long way from Broadway.\nIn the US at that time, Kitt was cancelled. Her career had faltered following a White House luncheon in 1968 to discuss the causes of juvenile delinquency with Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of President Lyndon B Johnson. As protests against the Vietnam War raged across the US, Kitt's diagnosis of the problem's causes upset the genteel audience. She told the First Lady: \"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don't want to go to school because they're going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.\"\nIn response, the CIA compiled a dossier on her. The New York Times revealed in 1975 that this extensive report contained \"second\u2010hand gossip about the entertainer but no evidence of any foreign intelligence connections\". Asked in later years about the notorious \"nymphomaniac\" claim reported to be contained in the document, Kitt was supremely dismissive: \"What has that got to do with the CIA if I was?\"\nWhile her career back home was in the doldrums, she spent time in Britain touring provincial clubs. During one such residency at the distinctly unglamorous Batley Variety Club in West Yorkshire, a BBC reporter asked her how such a sophisticated celebrity could feel an affinity with local people there. She replied: \"I wasn't born in such a different world. I came out of extreme poverty. I have acquired things, yes. The things have not acquired me.\"\nIt wasn't until 1978, ten years after that White House incident, that Kitt made her triumphant Broadway return in the musical Timbuktu!. She remained a frequent visitor to Britain, often making outrageous appearances on television talk shows. Again, her vulnerability was never too far from the surface. In one spectacular 1989 BBC appearance, she began by resting her feet flirtatiously on the lap of host Terry Wogan. Just a few minutes later, she was confessing that her public persona was nothing like her private self.\nShe said: \"Mr Wogan, you know something? I'm not an extrovert. I can tease as 'Eartha Kitt', but as Eartha Mae? Forget it. I'm hiding behind the bushes, behind the chairs, behind everything I could possibly find to hide behind, because I've never had that kind of security within Eartha Mae that makes me feel that she will ever be accepted.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How a child star saved a Hollywood studio\n\u2022 Nina Simone on how fury fuelled her songs\n\u2022 Toni Morrison on her mission to please black fans\nKitt's abiding loves were her fans and her daughter. Having been abandoned by her own mother, Kitt insisted on bringing her daughter with her all over the world. Her marriage to businessman Bill McDonald in 1960 lasted less than four years, and she never remarried. Asked by Wogan if she had been reluctant to let her guard down, she said: \"A man has always wanted to lay me down, but he never wanted to pick me up.\"\nShe said that it was the love she received from adoring crowds that \"makes me feel that I really am a worthwhile person\". However, she also explained: \"When I go back to the dressing room, I take off the makeup and I'm not 'Eartha Kitt' anymore, I'm Eartha Mae again.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "While the formal dress and classic dances of the Vienna balls have prevailed since the early 1800s, some events are taking unique approaches to the tradition.\nSince the early 1800s, locals and visitors have been gathering in the ballrooms of Vienna, Austria, to waltz the night away. Originally organised to entertain distinguished nobles and politicians gathered in the capital after the Congress of Vienna, the annual ball tradition has continued into the present day with thousands of people breaking out their finest clothing and gliding across dancefloors under magnificent chandeliers.\nThe city's ball season starts in November and continues until Shrove Tuesday (4 March 2025), with January and February marking the peak of the season. More than 450 balls take place in Vienna each year. These are typically formal and ceremonial affairs with a strict dress code of ball gowns and tuxedos, where modern accessories like wrist watches are considered a considered a faux pas. However, in recent years, more unique events have cropped up as well, led largely by a younger generation.\n\"There are more modern balls \u2013 young in both their origins and audience \u2013 where the dress codes are more relaxed,\" says Helena Steinhart, PR manager of the Vienna Tourist Board.\nDress Code\nWhile the dress code varies, female attendees are generally expected to wear floor-length evening gowns, while men typically don black tailcoats with a white bow tie and black shoes. For those who don't want to bring their formal attire, there are plenty of rental opportunities available in the city during the season.\nIf you're interested in attending a ball this year, a full list can be found online, with each dance selling tickets or spaces on the waiting list on their own sites.\nOne example is the annual Wiener Hip-hop Ball (15 February 2025). Launched five years ago, this ball is a fascinating blend of old and new, where participants pair traditional formal dress with trainers and dance to hip-hop music rather than the waltz.\nFor an even more relaxed ball experience, visitors can attend the Sweatpants Ball on 1 March. \"The dress code is, quite literally, in the name,\" quipped Steinhart.\u00a0\nMany newer balls have also been launched to create space for communities who might be uncomfortable at some of the more traditional events. The Rainbow Ball, for example, which took place on 25 January, specifically caters to the LGBT community and features a welcoming atmosphere for same-sex dancing couples.\nOther interesting events include the annual Vegan Ball, which includes a vegan gala dinner; and the Comic Con ball, where guests are encouraged to show up in cosplay as their favourite character.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A designer's guide to artisanal shopping in Vienna\n\u2022 What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022 A queer dance champion's guide to experiencing queer tango in Buenos Aires\nTickets for this year's ball season are still available, though some of the larger and more well-known balls, such as the Opera Ball (27 February 2025) are waiting list only. Resale tickets can sometimes be found online, though Steinhart cautions that this option is best for German speakers as there's no formal website to find them. Visitors can also book a tour package that includes a ball experience; or stay at one of several hotels in Vienna that offer ball-themed packages, such as the one at Almanac Palais.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Storm Darragh also brought similar red warnings in December.\nThe UK's summer was the coolest since 2015, driven by a south-shifted jet stream that brought northerly winds carrying Arctic air, though many areas still saw spells of temperatures up to 34C.\nMr Hardingham said: \"Watching the devastation caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles and the number of recent flooding incidents we have seen in the UK, it is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities in the future.\"\nHe added that fire crews were \"on the frontline\" in responding to extreme weather and \"repeatedly\" went \"above and beyond to protect their communities\".\nThe UK recorded temperatures of over 40C (104F) for the first time in 2022 - a heatwave that leading scientists said would have been \"almost impossible\" without human-induced climate change. \nIt saw several fire services tackle wildfires on parched parts of land including in South Yorkshire, Norfolk, Surrey, Kent and London. Some services declared major incidents.\nRail services were also cancelled in some areas after tracks overheated or buckled.\nThe NFCC is seeing the \"risks around extreme weather increasing\", Mr Hardingham said, adding that without \"adequate investment\" and government action, its \"capacity to keep communities safe and protect infrastructure is at risk\".\nThe NFCC urged the government to review the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which details how the government prepares and plans for emergencies, and also to ensure there are data analysis mechanisms in place that provide an assessment of the risk and impact of incidents linked to climate change.\nThe UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning it takes as much of the gases out of the atmosphere as it puts in.\nIt has made a series of pledges to reach this target, including achieving so-called 'clean' electricity by 2030 through rapidly increasing wind and solar generation, and investing in technology to capture and store carbon dioxide.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in November 2024 that the country would aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Storm Darragh also brought similar red warnings in December.The UK's summer was the coolest since 2015, driven by a south-shifted jet stream that brought northerly winds carrying Arctic air, though many areas still saw spells of temperatures up to 34C.Mr Hardingham said: \"Watching the devastation caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles and the number of recent flooding incidents we have seen in the UK, it is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities in the future. Some services declared major incidents.Rail services were also cancelled in some areas after tracks overheated or buckled.The NFCC is seeing the \"risks around extreme weather increasing\", Mr Hardingham said, adding that without \"adequate investment\" and government action, its \"capacity to keep communities safe and protect infrastructure is at risk\".A simple guide to climate changeWhat you can do to reduce carbon emissionsFour ways climate change worsens extreme weatherNorthamptonshire Search and RescueSome episodes of intense rainfall and wildfires have been driven by climate changeThe NFCC urged the government to review the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which details how the government prepares and plans for emergencies, and also to ensure there are data analysis mechanisms in place that provide an assessment of the risk and impact of incidents linked to climate change.The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning it takes as much of the gases out of the atmosphere as it puts in.It has made a series of pledges to reach this target, including achieving so-called 'clean' electricity by 2030 through rapidly increasing wind and solar generation, and investing in technology to capture and store carbon dioxide.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in November 2024 that the country would aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035.Could the UK actually get colder with global warming?A year of extreme weather that challenged billionsSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week. \"He added that fire crews were \"on the frontline\" in responding to extreme weather and \"repeatedly\" went \"above and beyond to protect their communities\".The UK recorded temperatures of over 40C (104F) for the first time in 2022 - a heatwave that leading scientists said would have been \"almost impossible\" without human-induced climate change.",

        "article_text": "Children played on fairground rides designed by the world's greatest artists for a single summer before they disappeared for decades.\nThe attractions were part of the world's first art funfair - Luna Luna - dreamed up by little-known Austrian creative Andr\u00e9 Heller in the 1970s, featuring a carousel by Keith Haring, a Ferris wheel by Jean-Michel Basquiat and a David Hockney pavilion.\nVisitors could wander Roy Lichtenstein's hall of mirrors and marvel at Salvador Dali's fun dome, sampling biscuits decorated by artist Gertie Fr\u00f6lich as actors dressed as nuns and flamingos milled about.\nA successful attraction for months, plans for a grand European tour formed - but when they later fell through, an extensive legal battle ensued and the rides were shut down, disassembled and packed away, forgotten.\nUntil now.\nAmerican entrepreneur Michael Goldberg stumbled across Luna Luna on an art blog. He'd never heard of it, despite some of the art world's biggest names contributing. Neither, to his surprise, had his friends in the industry.\n\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"\n'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.\nThe two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly. \nOpening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation. \nThe foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.\nDecades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen. \nHis key investor? Global rap star Drake, via his investment and entertainment business DreamCrew.\n\"The idea of restoring something so rich in cultural history outweighed the risks and for us, it wasn't about guarantees,\" Anthony Gonzales, CEO of DreamCrew, told the BBC.\nThe New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.\nWhen he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.\n\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.\nIt was a sleepless night.\nBut the next day, as more paper was removed from a second container, the light caught a toffee-apple-red handlebar to Haring's carousel, then the white floorboards of  Basquiat's Ferris wheel, which \"could have been painted days ago\". It was a moment of \"instant relief\", said Goldberg.\nUnearthing the artwork wasn't the hardest part of Luna Luna's revival.\nBrad Gooch, author of recent official Haring biography, Radiant: The Life and Line of Keith Haring, saw Luna Luna being reconstructed, describing the feat as \"mind boggling.\"\n\"It was like a giant Lego with no instruction kit,\" he said.\nA crew of artists, carnival technicians, curators and architects worked together to meticulously rebuild Luna Luna for two years before its grand reopening in LA this March.\nNow, Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy has come to a Midtown Manhattan art and theatre complex, The Shed. The fair is on display alongside exhibits detailing its surreal curation process. \nAlex Poots, creative co-founder of The Shed, described the journey as a \"Raiders of the Lost Ark story\", in reference to the film, praising Heller's ability to commission artists of such high calibre while finding a format appealing to \"art lovers and yet to be art lovers.\"\n\"That is a holy grail kind of pursuit,\" he added. \nMost of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s. \nHockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.\nGoldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space. \nDrake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.\nThere's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.\nBasquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.\nHaring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.\n\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"\nPoots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"\nBut he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\". \nIt has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".\nHe added that ticket prices, criticised by some as being too high, are \"pretty reasonable\" as the show cost \"millions and millions of dollars to install\".\nAmong the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.\nHaring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".\nThe show is running from 20 November to 23 February, and will tour after it leaves The Shed.",

These questions need answering.\nMahomes was sacked and hit more times than any other season in his career, while the Chiefs now have the top two pressure rates allowed when not even being blitzed in Super Bowl history.\nThat means the opposition can get to Mahomes without sending extra men so can still cover his receivers. It's a combination that will not only stop them winning more Super Bowls but also puts his health at risk.\nThe Chiefs have a huge commodity at quarterback, it's time they started protecting their star asset.\nSteve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defence was the only bright spot as they shackled Saquon Barkley.

No casualties were reported, the agency added.\nThe agency remains on \"high alert\" after the incident, with its director general Rafael Grossi saying there is \"no room for complacency\". \nMr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\". \nA catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.\nWhile the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.\nThe radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.\nZelensky posted footage on X appearing to show damage to the giant shield, made of concrete and steel, which covers the remains of the reactor that lost its roof in the explosion.\n\"Another 15 metres [50ft] to the side and there would have been a radiation accident,\" Hryhoriy Ishchenko, chief of the agency that manages the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, told reporters, according to local media.\nSince 1990, Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, while he admits the strike was a \"horrendous attack on a very important structure\", he is \"not concerned\" about the radiation risk.\nProf Smith told the BBC a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" below the damaged outer shield covers radioactive particles and dust from the explosion. \nSimon Evans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was head of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, which oversaw the construction of the protective dome in the 2010s.\nHe described the apparent strike as \"an incredibly reckless attack on a vulnerable nuclear facility\". \nThe shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.\nThe strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.\nThere appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.\nMr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.\n\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.\nZelensky claimed the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"definitely not preparing for negotiations\", after US President Donald Trump said Putin had agreed to begin talks to end the war earlier this week.\nThe incident at Chernobyl comes after increased military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, the IAEA said. \nIn December, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching a drone attack on a convoy of vehicles transporting IAEA experts heading to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear station.\nThe agency last year urged restraint when an attack on Zaporizhzhia raised the risk of a \"major nuclear incident\". Russia and Ukraine traded blame over the attack in August.\n\"I'm more concerned about Zaporizhzhia than Chernobyl,\" Prof Smith said. \n\"The reactors [at Zaporizhzhia] are currently shut down but there is more live fuel there. Chernobyl is still very radioactive, but it's not in a 'hot state' because of its age.\"\nThe number of people who died in the Chernobyl disaster remains disputed. \nAccording to the official, internationally recognised death toll, just 31 people died as an immediate result of Chernobyl while the UN estimates that 50 deaths can be directly attributed to the disaster. \nIn 2005, it predicted a further 4,000 might eventually die as a result of the radiation exposure.",

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. \n\"I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences.\"",

        "article_text": "\"I have no plans for the future at all,\" says Oleksandr Bezhan, standing next to an empty, frozen paddock where he used to work as a fisherman on the bank of the Dnipro river in southern Ukraine. \"If I wake up in the morning, that's already pretty good.\"\nMalokaterynivka sits just 15km (9 miles) north of the front line in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region.\nIf US President Donald Trump succeeds in halting the war, Malokaterynivka is hoping to end up on the right side of that front line.\nI last visited this area in 2023, when Ukraine launched a much-anticipated counter-offensive.\nAt the time, Ukrainians dared to dream of winning this war. They had, after all, won the battle of Kyiv and liberated swathes of territory elsewhere.\nBut 18 months on, thunder-like artillery exchanges reflect the failure of that operation, and Russia's dominance.\nThe front line here is broadly in the same place - but the broad expanse of river has gone.\nWhen the Russian-occupied Kakhovka dam downstream was destroyed, this became a vast, uninterrupted expanse of scrubland.\nThe barren surroundings reflect the frozen limbo in which Ukraine finds itself. The White House wants to end the war, but it's not as simple as blowing a full-time whistle.\n\"If the front line becomes a border, it would be scary\u2026 fighting could break out at any moment,\" explains Oleksandr.\nThe exposed riverbed separates our location from Russian-occupied territory. Distant sunlight bounces off the metallic Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in Moscow's grip since 2022.\nUkraine and the US both want peace, but that is where the consensus seems to end.\nWashington's vision of it, along with battlefield realities, means Russia will probably keep hold of the Ukrainian land it's seized.\nUkraine wants meaningful security guarantees that would prevent invading forces from pushing across the river.\nInstead, Trump has denied Kyiv's dream of joining the Nato alliance as he focuses on Russia.\nHaving watched and reported on Ukraine's fight for more than three years, it is an especially tough hand for the country to receive.\nThere are feelings of betrayal. Commentators criticise either Ukrainian President Zelensky or the new foreign policy of its biggest ally.\n\"The border wouldn't depend on us,\" says Oleksandr. \"It probably won't work out, but Seoul is 30km from North Korea, and they somehow live and prosper.\"\nMalokaterynivka's challenge of finding a new purpose lies at the heart of Ukraine's future.\nAnd while politicians talk about talks, Ukrainians continue to fight and die.\nVillagers gather for the funeral of a local soldier, also named Oleksandr.

The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied.\nThe M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region.\nThe city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.\nEarlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 30km (19 miles) north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance.\nBut there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC.  \nIn a village further north - Mayba - 70 bodies were found in a church, according to local media reports. \nA local community coordinator in North Kivu, Vianney Vitswamba, told the DR Congo news agency 7Sur7 that the bodies were found tied up. Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels - an Islamic State-linked group - were blamed, but the BBC has not confirmed the report.\n\nResidents of Bukavu contacted by the BBC said the authorities advised residents to remain indoors.\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference, DR Congo's President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be sanctioned, accusing it of having  \"expansionist ambitions\", the AFP news agency reports. \n\"We will no longer put up with our strategic resources being plundered for the benefit of foreign interests under the complicit gaze of those who feed on chaos,\" he is quoted as saying.\nAs well as being accused of backing the rebels, which Rwanda has denied, the country is also said to have its own troops in eastern DR Congo.\nRwandan President Paul Kagame has said his country's priority is security.  He has said Rwanda is in danger from Hutu rebels in DR Congo and has dismissed any threat of sanctions.  \nThe news of the latest advance comes as the continent's heads of state are due to meet at an African Union (AU) summit in Ethiopia on Saturday.\nThe head of the AU commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat is quoted by AFP as saying that a ceasefire \"must be observed\" adding that \"military campaigns are not going to solve these problems.

Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels - an Islamic State-linked group - were blamed, but the BBC has not confirmed the report.The DR Congo rebel leader whose fighters have created turmoilWhat's the fighting in DR Congo all about?Residents of Bukavu contacted by the BBC said the authorities advised residents to remain indoors.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, DR Congo's President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be sanctioned, accusing it of having  \"expansionist ambitions\", the AFP news agency reports. A local community coordinator in North Kivu, Vianney Vitswamba, told the DR Congo news agency 7Sur7 that the bodies were found tied up. He has said Rwanda is in danger from Hutu rebels in DR Congo and has dismissed any threat of sanctions. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied.The M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region.The city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.Earlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 30km (19 miles) north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance.But there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC.",

        "article_text": "Moments in human history are etched into the Earth. Now researchers are piecing together evidence of our impact on the planet \u2013 through the marks we've left on nature.\nThe microbes living in this French harbour have never recovered from World War Two. Between 2012 and 2017, Raffaele Siano pulled sediment cores from the seabed at Brest harbour, wondering what he was going to find. When he and his colleagues at the French Institute for Ocean Science (Ifremer), analysed the fragments of DNA captured in those cores \u2013 they discovered something remarkable.\nThe oldest, deepest layers of sediment \u2013 dating to before 1941 \u2013 had traces of plankton called dinoflagellates that were strikingly different to the genetic traces of plankton left in the shallower, more recent layers. \"There was a group, an order of these dinoflagellates, that was very abundant before World War Two \u2013 and after World War Two it almost disappeared,\" says Siano. He and his colleagues published a study detailing their findings in 2021.\nSiano mentions that Brest harbour had been bombed during the war. Then, in 1947, a Norwegian cargo ship exploded in the Bay of Brest. The disaster killed 22 people and spread ammonium nitrate, a toxic chemical used to make fertiliser and explosives, into the sea. Even younger sediment in the 1980s and 1990s showed further changes in the plankton community in the harbour. \"We correlated this from another type of pollution coming from intensive agricultural activities,\" says Siano.\nNature has a way of remembering things. Echoes of certain human activities, especially highly-polluting ones, sometimes show up in tree rings, coastal sediments and ecosystems. Arguably, these traces are hints of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch in which humanity is said to have irrevocably, and drastically, altered Earth. Human history, it turns out, is written into the very fabric of our planet \u2013 and the life that co-exists here with us.\nSiano and his colleagues are predominantly ecologists but they also work with historians. \"The land changed because of human impact and also because of historical events,\" Siano says. When the team analysed the sediment cores from Brest, they also detected a gradual rise in heavy metal pollution as time passed. Younger layers of sediment contained higher volumes of mercury, copper, lead and zinc, for example.\nThe report notes there were similar levels of some of these metals \u2013 especially lead and chromium \u2013 in Pearl Harbour, a major US naval base in Hawaii that was heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes in 1941. However, Siano adds that he can't be sure whether these metals came directly from the bombs themselves. Either way, there is a signal in both Brest and Pearl Harbour of a calamitous, and polluting, moment in human history.\nOther researchers have also scoured the planet in search of geological records of anthropogenic pollution. In China, soil sediments reveal a sharp increase in metal contamination since 1950 \u2013 which correlates with a rise in air pollution there during the second half of the 20th Century. A separate study explores how the emergence of industries such as shipbuilding may be linked with a higher incidence of heavy metal deposits in tree rings from certain parts of China.\nEven Roman metallurgy, from many centuries ago, has left its mark. One 2022 study found a noticeable rise in lead contamination in ice, sediment and peat cores from Europe, correlated with the development of Roman industry. It is sometimes difficult to be sure which specific events caused spikes in lead contamination, however, note the authors.\nJean-Luc Loizeau at the University of Geneva has studied the sediment of Lake Geneva, particularly the material found in a small area of the lake near to a wastewater treatment plant. He says the sediment there contains many traces of human activities. Crucially, the way water moves around in this part of the lake has helped to preserve such clues.\n\"It accumulates because there is a kind of gyre that keeps the sediment within the bay,\" he says, referring to Vidy Bay, on the northern shores of the lake. In a 2017 paper, he and colleagues describe the heavy metal pollution that became evident here in sediment layers dating to the 1930s. Among the specific examples he gives is a spike in mercury contamination during the 1970s.\n\"We know there was an accident in one of these industries,\" explains Loizeau. \"There was some spilling of mercury because there was a break in a tank and we really find this peak in the sediment.\" Plus, traces of elements such as barium in the cores could be linked to the rise of the automobile, adds Loizeau \u2013 because car brakes often contain barium.\nBesides metals, radioactive materials have also found applications in various industries. In Switzerland, for instance, radium was long used to make glow-in-the-dark details on watch faces. Remnants of radium from the watchmaking industry have turned up in landfill sites and buildings in the country.\nAnd scattered around the globe are pieces of evidence that reveal the grim legacy left by nuclear weapons during the 20th Century. Take the giant craters in the Nevada desert made by huge weapons tests, for example. But some contamination caused by nuclear detonations is much more subtle.\nIn 2019, researchers revealed that some of the grains of sand on beaches near the Japanese city of Hiroshima are in fact particles of debris created when the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city on 6 August 1945, towards the end of World War Two. \"The chemical composition of the melt debris provides clues to their origin, particularly with regard to city building materials,\" the authors wrote. In other words, the bomb turned buildings into dust, heat from the explosion reshaped that dust, and the blast ultimately spread this material across the nearby landscape \u2013 marking it forever.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nRemnants of nuclear explosions are not confined to the outdoors. They may be in your attic, too. Attic dust often lies undisturbed for decades \u2013 unlike urban soil, which is more likely to be disturbed \u2013 so traces of contaminants may remain.\nA study published in 2003 reports the results of a survey of 201 homes in the US state of New Jersey. Among the traces the researchers found there were lead concentrations that roughly correlated with the prevalence of lead in air pollution during the 20th Century. But they also found small amounts of Caesium-137, a radioactive isotope. This was more common the older the property was and could perhaps be explained, the researchers suggest, by the frequency of above ground nuclear weapons tests in the US \u2013 especially during the 1950s and 1960s.\nSiano and his colleagues are now looking further afield in their search for clues of human history embedded in nature. The team has collected more than 120 sediment cores from nine different countries around Europe, with the hope of finding further correlations between historical events and trace DNA or metal contamination left in those cores.\u00a0\n\"We can look for the impacts of the Vesuvius volcano [eruption] in Naples,\" says Siano, noting that the volcano last erupted in 1944. And here, as in other locations, the team may also detect signs of radioactive material ejected during the Chernobyl disaster \u2013 contamination from the accident having spread to over 40% of Europe.\u00a0\nAnd in yet more places, says Siano, evidence of everything from oil spills to the development of oyster farms may have been locked away in the sediment. \"We have all the material to answer these questions,\" he says.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u2013 and which allows art to swivel between different states of being.\nExpunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton\u2019s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It\u2019s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being \u2013 this world and another, life and death.\nOutside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming\u00a0into a\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European\u00a0royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual\u00a0coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange),\u00a0quickly embraced the linguistic\u00a0coincidence in the 1570s. His\u00a0orange-white-and-blue\u00a0rebel flag would become\u00a0the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion\u00a0of everything from Swiss fire\u00a0engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it\u2019s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully.\nFrom antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth\u2019s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire.\nConvinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latin aurum, meaning \u2018gold\u2019, and pigmentum meaning \u2018colour\u2019) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure.\nA spark to a flame\nIntentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet\u2019s plush orange jacket \u2013 its vibrant rumples flickering like flares \u2013 threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer\u2019s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work\u2019s flustering power would be utterly lost.\nNor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard\u2019s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don\u2019t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange \u2013 not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire.\nAnd so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we\u2019ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel. How else can you characterise the realm in which the liquified face of Munch\u2019s hero howls under a strange and estranging burnt-cinnamon sky in The Scream? How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse\u2019s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion?\nCommissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch\u2019s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other\u2019s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground. Her left foot is already sliding out of view. Far from depicting untroubled joy, Matisse\u2019s carefully choreographed masterpiece teeters on cosmic disaster. The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt.\nAmber alert\nMunch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte\u2019s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like orange\u201d. Like it or not, orange is frequently the heat that holds together \u2013 while threatening to break apart \u2013 the visual music of her sinuous mosaics.\nAs crucial as orange has been to the story of art through the end of the last century, it has already dyed itself indelibly into the unfolding fabric of contemporary artistic consciousness. Among the most celebrated major works of the new millennium, The Gates, by Bulgarian artist Christo Yavacheff and French artist Jeanne-Claude (known together as Christo and Jeanne-Claude), colonised New York City\u2019s Central Park in February 2005 with over 7,500 passageways \u2013 each flowing with orange nylon fabric. The lyrical succession of thresholds, which fostered a poetic sense of the endless comings and goings of life \u2013 birth and rebirth, mortality and eternity \u2013 could, on reflection, have only been draped in stirring saffron. To some, the colour echoes the robes of Buddhist monks. But to my mind, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who passed away four years later) were rekindling a sacred flame, inviting those who would come to bask their weary souls in the transformative power of that most mystical of ancient tints: orange.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier.\nBeware of green. It can\u2019t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment\u2019s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, \u201cvanishes into thin air\u201d. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso\u2019s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nTo dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green\u2019s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour \u2013 one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history.\nDonning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. \u201cLike the vampire,\u201d the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, \u201cshe has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave\u201d. Describing Leonardo\u2019s inscrutable sitter as \u201colder than the rocks among which she sits\u201d, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from \u201ca diver in deep seas\u201d to a savvy operator who has woven \u201cstrange webs with Eastern merchants\u201d. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant\u2019s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was \u201cthe mother of Helen of Troy\u201d and the \u201cmother Mary\u201d.\nLong before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris \u2013 ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh\u2019s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence.\nPerennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt\u2019s kings the path to resurrection.\nFlora and fauna\nFor millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the \u2018The Asp of Jerusalem\u2019. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade.\nAn acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he\u2019d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe\u2019s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012.\nFertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini\u2019s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy\u2019s bump in Jan van Eyck\u2019s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn\u2019t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal.\nAn alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green\u2019s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck\u2019s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao \u2013 his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple\u2019s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it\u2019s green.\nSo green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable\u2019s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting \u2013 a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured.\nThough rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour\u2019s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one\u2019s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation.\nHiding in plain sight\nIn more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin\u2019s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour\u2019s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue \u2013 as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond.\nBelgian surrealist painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist\u2019s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. \u201cEverything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,\u201d Magritte observed to an interviewer. \u201cThere is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.\u201d\nNo contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully\u2019s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse\u2019s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully\u2019s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer\u2019s space, the ficus greens of Scully\u2019s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time. \nStarting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings.\nThe collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dal\u00ed's friend and publisher.\n\"Dal\u00ed was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,\" Ms Argillet told the BBC.\nSome of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests.\nDal\u00ed's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. \nIn his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. \n\"Appreciating Dal\u00ed's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,\" Ms Argillet says.\nBringing Dal\u00ed's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition.\n\"The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,\" Ms Aggarwal says. \nStrictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dal\u00ed's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist.\nIn 1967, Dal\u00ed famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers.\nIn return, Dal\u00ed demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed.\nShe finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dal\u00ed had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out).\nDal\u00ed's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality.\nBorn in Spain in 1904, Dal\u00ed grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Andr\u00e9 Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dal\u00ed.\nThe surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by Andr\u00e9 Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was \"dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason\", according to Breton.\nDal\u00ed was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges.\nConsequently, Dal\u00ed's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. \n\"Dal\u00ed was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,\" Ms Argillet says.\nThe artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dal\u00ed revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache.\n\"Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,\" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache.\nIn the same interview, he described his moustache as being \"very gay, very pointed, very aggressive\".\nMs Argillet, who knew Dal\u00ed intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dal\u00ed being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and \"shocking the bourgeois\".\nHe once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover.\n\"At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,\" Ms Argillet says. \nBut she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dal\u00ed's shyness that made him over-perform in public.\n\"He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dal\u00ed, just like his paintings,\" Ms Argillet says.\n\"The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dal\u00ed.\"\nThe exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March.\nThis article has been updated to reflect that two Dali colour etchings are at Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city.",

        "article_text": "These tiny soldiers can eat four times their own weight in organic waste \u2013 and turn it into sustainable fertiliser.\nWith a unique ability to consume nearly any form of organic matter it comes across, one small but mighty insect is becoming a tool to address the growing problem of organic waste and soil degradation. The bug, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), transforms food waste into nutrient-rich biofertiliser: frass.\nInsects have been long been used in agricultural practices as a food source \u2013 but now farmers are exploring the potential of bug poo as a sustainable fertiliser. With over 33% of the world's soil currently degraded, depleted of the nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth, frass can play a major role in restoring soil biodiversity and quality.\u00a0\nIn May 2024, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded grants to three projects that seek to harness this soldier fly's capabilities. This included Chapul Farms, an Oregon-based project development company that's reweaving insects back into American agriculture to eliminate food waste, restore soil health, and produce high-quality animal feed.\nBacked by the Fertilizer Production and Expansion Program (FPEP), the bipartisan support of the use of insects in agriculture highlights the growing recognition of BSFL's potential \u2013 for both waste reduction and for enhancing soil health through the production of high quality domestic fertiliser.\nBut despite the bug's seeming superpowers, the widespread application of BSFL remains limited. The question is: why? And how can companies like Chapul Farms, now equipped with federal support, change that?\nBSFL can consume nearly any kind of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. Facilities like Chapul Farms utilise its voracious appetite to process large quantities of waste, with the larvae consuming up to\u00a0four times their own body waste in organic matter everyday. This happens in a fraction of the time required for traditional composting, which can take up to 10 months. The larvae's efficiency allows for a rapid turnover of organic material into nutrient-rich excrement \u2013 or frass.\n\"They can reproduce pretty quickly too,\" says Shankar Ganapathi Shanmugam, Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University. \"And it [BSFL] grows on dead and decaying material, which means that it can survive on waste.\"\nShanmugam is spearheading research on the use of frass as a crop nutrient, which until now has not been studied in the US \u2013 though it has been studied in other parts of the world, notably in multiple countries across\u00a0Europe.\nChapul collaborates with neighbouring farms to exchange waste for frass, creating a circular system. It's a mutually beneficial exchange as the farms receive nutrient-rich soil amendment and Chapul receives the fuel for their operation. And it's doing something significant for insect populations too: helping to repopulate them.\nThis is because insect farming operations create a controlled environment for the bugs to thrive. The frass created from them\u00a0provides essential nutrients\u00a0to plants and fosters a more biodiverse soil, which encourages the growth of native plant and insect species, thus supporting the overall ecosystem.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"We could make compost out of anything but the impact of running it through this insect biology has all of these [positive] implications,\" says Mimi Casteel, an Oregon wine farmer who has been using Chapul's frass. \"It's exciting for so many reasons: it's a portable, pretty low cost investment compared to some other things that we're considering as part of dealing with our massive problems with waste, and soldier flies are replacing a missing layer of diversity.\"\nChapul has worked with local vineyards, researchers and farms to research, educate and promote frass benefits and adoption in the bioregion. TAINABLE, a local soil restoration non-profit, provides laboratory space and farmland to Chapul for their research.\nAs organic waste production continues to place a massive burden on energy and carbon emissions, there is an increasing need for more efficient and sustainable processing methods. And BSFL's digestive processes can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"Finding a use for this is important, but if you're going to market frass as a fertiliser, you need to regulate it, which takes time,\" says Shanmugam. \"And to make these regulations you need research.\"\nThe US National Organic Program does not include insects as an acceptable additive as of now. This makes it a challenge to share this technique with farmers who use organic practices, though teams like Chapul Farms are in conversations with regulators to increase education around it and usher in its inclusion.\nUnlike chemical fertilisers, which often deplete soil over time, frass promotes biodiversity within the soil by introducing a diverse microbial community. This boosts soil resilience, natural plant defence, improves its ability to retain water, and reduces the need for costly synthetic inputs. In sharp contrast, synthetics can wreck soil biodiversity, beneficial bacteria and the soil's natural micro-ecosystem, leaving it dependent on increasingly expensive inputs. They also have intensive fossil-fuel requirements, and reduce soil's carbon carrying capacity.\n\"We recently saw even more of a push for our government to get projects funded that support domestic fertiliser production,\" says Aly Moore, Chief Communications Officer of Chapul Farms. \"We realise how many health issues are caused by the reduced nutrient density in crops, and all the pesticides used. And on the cost factor, farmers will not only need less fertiliser over time, but also fewer pesticides.\"\nThis can all contribute to cost savings and be more incentive for farmers, especially at a time when fertiliser prices are sky high and supply is unreliable. Prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. With the US being the world's third-largest fertiliser importer, American farmers felt the brunt of this impact; making it not just a fertiliser issue, but also one of food security.\n\"In the two years leading up to 2023, there was an 8% reduction in global fertiliser consumption, because people were priced out of the market,\" says Michael Place, Chief Technology Officer at Chapul Farms. \"There were supply disruptions and even unavailability. And FPEP emerged from this sort of emergency.\"\nSoil microbes present an exciting frontier for regenerating soil health, yet less than 1% of total microbes in soil have been cultivated. Frass provides an opportunity to pivot from the reductionist methods of treating soils that perpetuated the soil crisis in the first place, all while bolstering food and agricultural security.\nFarmers will eventually need less frass to maintain the same levels of soil productivity, as the microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health and resiliency by improving biodiversity.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 A 2,000-year-old method to water crops\n\u2022 The ignored potential of human poo\nFarmers who have begun using frass in their fields are already reporting promising results.\u00a0Casteel is in the midst of facilitating trials to assess the impact of frass on her crops. While the statistical outcome of the study is still in progress, she has already witnessed perceptible changes.\n\"Anecdotally, what I can tell you is that in the trials that I've done both with grapevines and in my vegetable farm, the produce itself comes up faster, it has better cellular structure,\" says Casteel. \"So if you actually cut the leaf and put it under the microscope, the cells grow more densely and they have figure lipid membranes. And what that means is that the plant from day one has more structural integrity,\" she says.\nThe FPEP funds will support construction and equipment for BSFL facilities located in Oregon and North Dakota. The projects anticipate yielding 10,000 tons of frass per location per year and will generate 59 new jobs, upon its opening which is expected to be in 2026.\u00a0\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the nascent insect agriculture industry is the tunnel vision around insects for protein production which has overshadowed the benefits of frass in soil health. While protein from BSFL is a lucrative and fast-growing market, frass remains an underutilised resource in insect agriculture.\nThe global insect protein market was valued at nearly $1 billion in 2022 (\u00a3805m), while global frass was valued at $96 million (\u00a377m) in 2023, and frass's projected growth is substantially higher. Plus, according to the Chapul Farms team, insect farms produce twice as much frass as larvae.\u00a0\n\"I think farmers have historically been convinced that insects are problems, and they just don't want to talk about adding more problems to their situation,\" says Casteel. \"But when our farms become more complex, you start to see an exponential rollout of ecological returns.\"\u00a0\nIn addition, insects are keystone species, meaning entire ecosystems would drastically change or collapse without them \u2013 and our world would \"grind to a halt\", as the biologist Dave Goulson\u00a0wrote in the Guardian newspaper.\u00a0\n\"Ultimately, at its core, we cannot survive without insects,\" says Pat Crowley, CEO of Chapul Farms. \"Natural ecosystems cannot flourish... without the insects as a part of them. And that's one of our biggest premises. It's not as simple as: insects will solve the biggest trends in global agricultural health. And at the same time, I think it's one of the biggest levers that we have in making agriculture a more resilient, ecosystem-based model.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas. \nModi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\nWhile both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\". \nThe Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US. \nAt a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.\n\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".\nTrump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries. \n\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.\nWith India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC. \n\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said. \nHowever, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said. \n\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit. \nTrump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets. \nThe two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".\nModi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US. \nLast week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday. \n Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\nShortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.\nHe acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".\nTrump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.\n\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"\nThe White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.\nThe document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.\n\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said. \n\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"\nTrump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic. \nHe has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. \nEarlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs.",

        "article_text": "Some species of birds like geese save energy by flying in close formation. Airliners could use a similar trick to burn less fuel.\nIn the early 1500s, Italian Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci developed a fascination with avian flight. He spent his days meticulously studying the movement of birds, sketching observations of how they maintain their balance and perform soaring manoeuvres.\nHis ambition was to make a flying machine from his scientific investigations. But what he wound up creating instead was the seminal work\u00a0Codex on the Flight of Birds. It pioneered what would later become the field of \"biomimicry\", the study of the natural world in search of efficient design.\u00a0\nCenturies later, experimentation flourished. Pioneering aviators like Otto Lilienthal, Igo Etrich and the Wright brothers mimicked birds to design their aircraft and the aviation industry was born.\nIn 2019, Airbus returned to the study of birds with the \"fello'fly\" project to understand how migrating geese conserve energy while flying in V formation. From it, a\u00a0\"wake energy retrieval\" technique was developed to help\u00a0trailing jets\u00a0pinpoint the optimal location to fly in the wake vortex of a lead jet. This was found to generate fuel savings of 5% to 10% per\u00a0trip, similar to\u00a0findings published by the US space agency Nasa.\u00a0\nIn July 2023, the effort evolved into the\u00a0Geese project\u00a0with\u00a0\u20ac10m (\u00a38.4m/$10.5m)\u00a0in funding, and support from the European Union's air traffic management research arm, Sesar.\nEarlier this month, Delta Air Lines and Airbus announced that they were taking the \"fello'fly\" concept out of the lab and into the skies, targeting the second half of this year to deploy the technique into live operations. The goal will be to test a manoeuvre called \"rendez-vous\" in which two passenger jets are paired over the Atlantic Ocean. For example, this could be an Air France flight from New York City and a Delta Air Lines flight from Miami, both heading to London. In pairing, the two planes would be separated by the regulatory 1,000ft (303m) in altitude while attempting to\u00a0reduce the distance between them to\u00a01.2 nautical miles (2.2km), the same distance that fuel savings were most recently achieved in the lab.\nDelta chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca tells the BBC that this distance is substantially closer than planes fly today, which is typically at a separation of three to five nautical miles (5.5 to 9.2km), so the first step will be to see whether the gap can be narrowed without compromising safety.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0video\u00a0shows an animation of how \"fello'fly\" is expected to work.\nAs for why transatlantic flights were chosen for the test, DeLuca explains, \"there are very few sustainable solutions for wide bodies flying today, besides sustainable aviation fuel. So a 5% benefit off of a flight that's going across the Atlantic with a big airplane that's burning a lot of fuel has the biggest bang for the buck\".\nStephen Trent, an analyst at Citi, says on some routes the formation flying technique could be useuful. \"My guess is that it is also somewhat route dependent, and somewhat dependent on what kind of equipment you're operating. So the opportunity to do that, for example, flying from New York to London, is not going to be the same as an aircraft that's flying from Miami to Mexico City. It's possible that, in some cases, that's something that could help \u2013 like a tailwind that pushes a sailing ship.\"\nAiming to decarbonise operations by 2050, the Delta Carbon Council reported that it had saved\u00a041 million\u00a0gallons (65,800 tonnes) of jet fuel in 2024. DeLuca says that to achieve this, Delta is constantly on the lookout for new ways to conserve energy, like plugging into ground power instead of operating engines on the ground, doing a shorter vector on approach instead of a long roundabout when landing, and installing winglets that point up on the tips of wings to reduce drag.\nOther industry practices include\u00a0continuous climb and decline operations\u00a0that enable\u00a0an altitude to be reached without the need for levelling and\u00a0adjusting the centre of gravity\u00a0on the aircraft to reduce drag.\u00a0Switching to a renewable energy source like\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel is also seen as a solution, however this will require a staggering amount of land to grow enough biomass to make biofuels.\u00a0\u00a0\nDeLuca says Delta quadrupled\u00a0its\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel\u00a0(SAF) usage\u00a0in 2024, but that's still less than 1% of the fuel\u00a0being used\u00a0with it. The main hurdle,\u00a0she says, is the supply of sustainable fuel. However, she's encouraged by Airbus joining Delta which has stated a commitment to purchase several million gallons of SAF annually starting in the second half of 2025.\nKnowing customers are lining up to buy the product gives farmers in rural communities a reason to redirect soy and corn ethanol production into sustainable aviation fuel, says DeLuca.\n\"It's really about economic and social development in rural communities \u2013 job creation, attracting investment into these communities. It's a new industry, so will be a big development opportunity for these sites,\" Airbus chief sustainability officer Julie Kitcher tells the BBC.\nTrent says sustainable aviation fuel won't yet be a silver bullet because it costs far more than conventional fuel. \"Let's say today jet fuel kerosene is like $2.50 (\u00a32) a gallon. If you look at SAF a gallon it can be more than three times that price... Assuming production needs to increase, then bring the price down.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Extreme flying in the name of science\n\u2022\u00a0Can we really fuel planes with fat and sugar?\n\u2022\u00a0How long-haul travel may change\nMeanwhile, across the airline industry, interest in biomimicry has been growing.\nAirbus has a project through its UpNext innovation lab\u00a0\u00a0taking inspiration from eagles, with the goal of creating longer, leaner and lighter high-performance, ultra-flexible wings that can bend and evolve depending on air current and turbulence, with hinges that adapt dynamically and sensors that can determine nuanced movements. It is similar to the morphing wing created by Nasa.\u00a0\nThey are not the only company looking into the technique. Boeing has a partnership with Nasa where it is testing coatings to reduce insect adhesion through the study of lotus leaves.\u00a0\nAnd Lufthansa has been working with chemicals manufacturer BASF on developing a surface film called AeroShark to simulate the texture of shark skin in an effort to save millions of tonnes of fuel per year.\n\"Birds are the experts of flight and so we're using nature to inspire technology,\" Kitcher says. For formation flying, they may be the greatest teachers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.What has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?Reeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.We established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.Reeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.However, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockScience Secretary Peter Kyle has criticised the BBC's reporting on Rachel ReevesWhat did the HR manager say?Wayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team.",

And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.\nSpeaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.\n\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said. \nHe added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals. \nThe UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.\nBut a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.\nBoth the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\nBy 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.\nThe funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.\nDr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.\n\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.\nAlthough there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.\nBut Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.\nThe committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.\nThe committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.\nBut it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.\n\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.\nHis committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.\nThe government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.\n\nMirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.\n\"We argue that carbon storage mandates on fossil fuel producers are fair whilst also providing the kind of investment certainty that companies need,\" she said.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The 'missing middle' of small businesses\n\u2022\u00a0Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love\n\u2022\u00a0Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things\nWhere do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?\nMy perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.\nI'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "Abraham Lincoln's wife was long attacked for everything from her spending to her lack of emotional restraint. But with two new plays about her, she is finally getting better press.\nDuring last month's US presidential inauguration, as ever during these quadrennial celebrations, fierce interest focused on the First Lady. Much was made of Melania Trump's dresses, her enigmatic smiles, and especially the navy-blue wide-brimmed boater-style hat \u00a0she wore for the swearing-in. Was the hat a deliberate choice, to shield her face from the prying eyes of the public? No one could say, but legions speculated.\nHow unenviable is the lot of the President's wife, lacking in formal power but constantly judged \u2013 expected to be immaculately turned out, and to remain, in conduct, ever above reproach. The court of public opinion has found no First Lady more wanting than Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of Abraham Lincoln. Her husband, who emancipated the slaves, and saved the union, enjoys near-universal adulation, while Mrs Lincoln has been the subject of criticism and disapproval since her first days in Washington in 1861 when she embarked on plans for a lavish redecoration of the White House. She travelled to New York for a shopping spree, and reporters followed her everywhere. One for The New York Herald wrote: \"Mrs Lincoln, who has been engaged since her arrival in making large purchases at some of the leading merchants, was out yesterday enjoying herself in the usual way.\" \u00a0\nSuch reports did not go down well in the besieged, wartime capital. Indeed, the loyalty of the First Lady, who hailed from a slave-holding family, and had three half-brothers in the Confederate Army, was questioned throughout the Civil War. Even after her husband was shot on 14 April 1865 by Confederate supporter John Wilkes Booth, as he sat beside her in Ford's Theater, the public didn\u2019t embrace their hero's widow. In 1875, her own son had her committed to an insane asylum.\u00a0\nAnd yet today, in the era of TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook, where social esteem rises and falls capriciously on clicks and likes, the maligned Mary Todd Lincoln is getting some compassionate reassessment on the stage, most particularly in Mrs President, a new play by US historian, writer and artist John Ransom Phillips opening this week at London's Charing Cross Theatre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis two-hander centres on the relationship between Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Miriam Grace Edwards), and Mathew Brady, considered the father of American photo-journalism (Sam Jenkins-Shaw) who took iconic pictures of Abraham Lincoln, his family, and the battlefields of the bloody US Civil War. The new play imagines the First Lady, coming to Brady\u2019s studio to sit for her portrait, aware that she is an object of suspicion because of her southern heritage, and seeking an \"image that will define history\u2019s view of me\". Brady declares he has the power to do that. \"I shape the image of people who shape America. Past. Present. Future,\" he says. \u00a0\nIn Ransom Phillips' depiction, Mrs Lincoln demands to be addressed as Mrs President, and engages in an on-going verbal tug of war with Brady over how she should be portrayed. The play asks who controls the revelatory public image, the subject or the artist? This question transcends time and place, but has specific resonance for the former First Lady who sought, and believed she never received, proper recognition during her life for all she had done, and suffered. Later scenes follow Mrs Lincoln into her widowhood, and other controversial historical figures of mid-19th-Century America \u2013 abolitionist John Brown, Chief Justice Roger Taney, and naturalist John James Audubon \u2013 appear on stage, depicted by Jenkins-Shaw. Mrs President is a daringly kaleidoscopic look at the ownership of self.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn truth, Mary Todd Lincoln and Mathew Brady's relationship was a limited one. She did pose for Brady at his studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in November of 1861. When she saw the photographs, she was unhappy with how she looked and instructed that they all be destroyed, except for one she deemed \"passable\", in which she stands, and her face is seen in profile; Brady ignored this request and kept all the photographs in his archives. And later in Lincoln's term, she returned to the studio a few times, but it's not known if Brady took any other of her portraits, as he deputised much studio work to his assistants.\u00a0\nRansom Philips tells the BBC his aim with the play wasn't to document history but rather \"to rescue Mary Todd Lincoln from ridicule and caricature, and to show her as fully a person, a woman of complexity and depth of feeling \u2013\u00a0possessing the kind of emotionality that men often lack\". And his view of Brady is not totally benign. \"Brady is an artist, like I am, and I know artists can be tyrannous.\"\nIn a wildly different way, another theatre production currently running in New York is also sympathetic to the 16th First Lady. Oh, Mary! has been a huge word-of-mouth hit since it first premiered at the city's\u00a0Lucille Lortel Theatre in February 2024, before transferring to Broadway in the summer. This comedy, written by Cole Escola and described by The New York Times as \"gleefully tasteless\" and an \"unhinged historical fantasia\", depicts Mary as a lascivious, self-centered alcoholic who yearns to escape the White House and her nasty, neglectful husband so as to become a cabaret star. Until Escola turned over the role to Betty Gilpin last month, they themselves starred as Mary \u2013 in drag, shaking a mop-like wig of black barrel curls. All joking aside, and Oh, Mary! has numerous slapstick moments, the play's inspiration was Escola\u2019s own sense of identification with Mary \u2013 a woman who could be \"too much\" and was \"trapped in this role she was wrong for\", as Escola explained in an interview on NPR last year.\u00a0\nPerhaps unintentionally, Escola and Phillips have joined a century-long debate among historians over how Mary Lincoln should best be understood. Was she an energetic, ambitious young woman who recognised genius in Lincoln, a rough-hewn country lawyer, and propelled him to greatness? Or was she a volatile wife who made Lincoln's domestic life a living hell, hurling accusations \u00ad\u2013 and on occasion crockery \u2013 at him during regular fits of rage? Was she first unhinged by grief in 1850, when she lost her son Eddie at age three to tuberculosis? Or was it the loss of a second son, Willy, 12 years later, that really drove her mental health decline? Did she take bribes and pad expense accounts as First Lady? Or did she act as a valuable helpmeet, giving President Lincoln sage advice?\n\"In the public imagination she's multiple people \u2013 it all depends on who is examining her,\" historian Jason Emerson tells the BBC. Author of seven books on the Lincoln family, including The Madness of Mary Lincoln, Emerson is currently assembling a complete volume of the former First Lady's letters for the Lincoln Studies Center of the University of Illinois. \"Mary was a complex person, very human, and she made mistakes, as Lincoln did too. She is essentially a tragic figure.\"\nLoss haunted Mary's life starting at the age of six, when her mother died. After Mary's father remarried and sired nine children with his new wife, love was a scant commodity in the family home in Lexington, Kentucky. Mary escaped to Springfield, Illinois, where she lived with her elder sister. Vivacious in conversation and praised, too, for her pretty face and milky complexion, young Mary had many admirers. She found in Lincoln a man who shared her passion for poetry, theatre and Whig politics, and who was also nearly 10 years older and more than a foot taller. But rather than provide her with the steady paternal affection she missed out on as a child, Lincoln was often away from home, working as a lawyer on the Illinois judicial circuit. As introverted as his wife was extroverted, Lincoln struggled to respond to her emotional pleas for attention and sympathy.\n\"Temperamentally they were very different,\" Emerson says. \"And as she aged, her mental problems got worse, consistent with bi-polar issues.\" Emerson's study of Mary Lincoln and her extended family has convinced him that she suffered from the condition formerly known as manic depressive disorder, not widely diagnosed in the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe stresses on both Lincolns during their time in wartime Washington were immense, and Mary was determined to dress fashionably and entertain lavishly. \"She thought of herself as the Queen of America, doing what she was supposed to do as First Lady\" says Emerson. \"Her narcissism was perhaps her greatest vulnerability.\" But when their son Willie succumbed to typhoid in 1862, she refused to get out of bed for weeks and grieved so copiously her husband rebuked her.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What do these First Lady portraits reveal?\n\u2022 The Abraham Lincoln portrait that was a fake\n\u2022 The 17th-Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait\nPerhaps it was inevitable that this often unrestrained woman, would continue to get bad press after her death in 1882. William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, reinforced the most unflattering views of Mary Lincoln, in the biography he co-wrote in 1889 titled Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life. Herndon and Mary despised each other during Lincoln's lifetime and competed for his attention. In private Herndon called her a \"she-wolf\".\nFor many decades, Herndon's interpretation stood \u2013 Mary Todd Lincoln was regarded as a harridan married to a saint. But in the 1980s and 1990s, when scholars began to seriously reassess the role of women in history, the troubled First Lady got a fresh look. In 1987, Jean Baker, a historian at Maryland's Goucher College published Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, portraying the Lincoln marriage as fundamentally tolerant and loving, and Mary as a vital, behind-the-scenes participant in her husband's political career, consoling, advising and encouraging.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat view in turn, was contradicted by renowned Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame in his 2021 book An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. Burlingame believes Lincoln was made miserable by his wife, who, he believes, at times physically abused him, and posits she seduced Lincoln to force him to marry her \u2013 they were wed on a day's notice, their first child born a scant nine months later. And Burlingame is certain, based on evidence in US government archives, that she solicited bribes and sold permits and pardons while in the White House. Yet, the author credits Mary with fuelling Lincoln\u2019s rise. \"If he hadn't married a woman who was so ambitious and so willing to prod her husband and to goad him... he may not have gone as far as he did,\" the historian said in a recent interview for the History Unplugged podcast. Moreover, Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with difficult people, a gift constantly on display during his Presidency, had been honed by plenty of practice at home, in Burlingame's view.\nAuthor, too, of the definitive Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (2009) Burlingame was among numerous experts consulted by director Steven Spielberg for his 2012 hit film, Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the president and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The film portrays the First Lady in a generally positive light, and husband and wife as closely bonded. And yet Burlingame realised that Spielberg and scriptwriter Tony Kushner had closely studied his biography \u2013 which included his hypothesis about the hasty Lincoln wedding \u2013 when Day-Lewis (as Lincoln) and Field (as Mary Lincoln) argue over their eldest son Robert joining the army. He's in favour, she's opposed, and Mary accuses her husband of never liking the boy. \"You've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief,\" she says. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast.\nBut even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. And it's one of the pleasures of the play Mrs President to see the heroine put up a fight for her own identity, and ignore the often harsh and deprecating judgements rained down upon her both before and after her death.\nMrs President is at Charing Cross Theatre, London until March 16. Oh Mary! is booking at the Lyceum Theatre, New York until 28 June.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Author of seven books on the Lincoln family, including The Madness of Mary Lincoln, Emerson is currently assembling a complete volume of the former First Lady's letters for the Lincoln Studies Center of the University of Illinois. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast.AlamySally Field in Steven Spielberg's Lincoln (2012), which portrayed Mary Todd in a generally positive light (Credit: Alamy)But even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes.",

        "article_text": "This year's Global Responsible Tourism Award winners demonstrate that travel can be inclusive, climate-friendly, nature-positive and a positive force for local communities.\nCelebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Responsible Tourism Awards are a standard bearer for the positive side of the travel industry. Run by the non-profit International Centre for Responsible Tourism Global, the awards aim to showcase the benefits of tourism and inspire other firms to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nAwards like these are particularly important at a time when tourism is under pressure. With global travel and tourism numbers back to pre-pandemic levels and one in 10 people employed in the industry, the need to improve the sector's environmental, economic and cultural impact is clear. Lifting up businesses that give back to their local communities creates a win-win for tourists and locals alike. And for travellers interested in supporting local culture, having extraordinary nature experiences and a ensuring a responsible travel industry, the winning firms have demonstrated their ability to do that and more.\u00a0\nTess Longfield, head of sustainability communications at Sabre, who sponsors the awards, commented that extraordinary work is being done by all the winners to create a more sustainable and equitable world through tourism. \"It's a testament to the power of responsible travel to make a real difference,\" she said.\nFrom a private ecolodge in South Africa to a volunteering organisation in a Peruvian biosphere reserve, these are the firms to book with in 2024 and beyond:\nThis five-star ecolodge set in 3,500 hectares of South African wilderness is constantly researching pioneering ways of doing things to improve the lives of the local community and protect the fragile landscapes and wildlife that surround it.\nAs well as offering unique tourism experiences to guests, such as guided walks to the flora-rich fynbos and coastal safaris in in waters teeming with great white sharks and dolphins, Grootbos' lodge provides ecotourism jobs to the local community. Profits from the lodge fund the Grootbos Foundation, which gives free skills and business training for hundreds of local people in the areas of hospitality, horticulture, entrepreneurship and biodiversity. It creates a ripple effect that's much needed during a period of serious unemployment in South Africa.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe judging team called Grootbos \"an exemplary business that others can learn from\", praising the way that it constantly pushes the boundaries and explores new ways of developing responsible tourism.\u00a0\n\"Grootbos cares about community and conservation,\" said Phil Murray, fundraising, donor relations and communications manager at Grootbos Foundation. \"Neither can be ignored, and both can mutually benefit from programmes and a responsible tourism business that prizes people and planet.\"\nRajasthan Studio curates art experiences with master artisans in Rajasthan, allowing travellers to experience, understand and value the local culture of the place they are visiting. Travellers can visit master artists at their homes and studios, meet their families, see the process behind making local handicrafts and co-create a personalised souvenir with the crafter.\nThe experiences include an insight into rare and unique art forms like puppetry and the blue pottery of Jaipur, pichwai\u00a0art and sea foam carving of Udaipur, leather juttis and tie dye of Jodhpur and much more. The idea is to build a community of artists and scale the business to different parts of Rajasthan, and eventually across India.\u00a0\n\"Rajasthan as a state is blessed with a wonderful art heritage and travellers are eager to explore every bit of it,\" said company founder Kartik Gaggar. \"But why should we limit it to exploring? We asked the same question and the answer was: let's turn it into an experience.\"\u00a0\nThe judges were impressed with how Gaggar has created an immersive cultural experience that both economically benefits artists and enriches travellers. They called it a \"highly replicable approach\".\nToday, the company offers more than 20 hand-on art experiences in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, with plans to include artists from Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Bundi and Kota in the near future.\nAs this year's protests have been demonstrating, tourism has an impact on local people as much as visitors. Sivatel Bangkok was this year's winner for its innovative approach that brings together local providers to directly help the community.\nThe hotel sources 70% of its ingredients organically and partners with more than 50 local farmers through the Sivatel's Farmer Friends Network. It also supports local producers and fosters a sustainable ecosystem through the \"Sivatel Sustainable Market\", a pop-up market within the hotel where local artisans and food producers can sell their wares to travellers. Uniforms are designed by Folkcharm, a local sustainable fashion brand that supports local artisans.\nPerhaps most uniquely, it runs a \"From Kitchen to Chicken\" programme, diverting hotel food scraps to feed black soldier fly larvae, which are then used as protein for organic chickens at a local chicken farm, where the hotel then sources its meat.\nThe judging panel found Sivatel Bangkok's structured programme based around regenerative agriculture and funding impressive, along with the way it sources and trains local providers.\u00a0\n\"We believe that to live on this Earth, we cannot live alone but must support each other,\" said Sivatel CEO Alisara Sivayathorn.\nWith a business that serves more than six million holidaymakers a year, TUI is one of the best-known tourism brands in Europe. Its deep and comprehensive commitment to inclusivity impressed the judges: the tour operator has devised a unique way to help those with access needs book their accommodations.\nAmong TUI's many initiatives, they have 90 dedicated agents in their contact centre who have had specialist accessibility training; the team has partnered with AccessAble to survey hotels and develop detailed access guides; and also works with Sign Live to provide interpreting services for British Sign Language Users.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022\u00a0The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\n\"Around one in four of the UK population lives with a disability or condition that impacts their daily life,\" said Marina Snellenberg, TUI's accessibility manager, \"and the prevalence of disability rises sharply with age. It's important that TUI consider the needs and expectations of the disabled community, allowing for a sustained and deliverable customer experience for years to come.\"\u00a0\nJudges were pleased to see a major tour operator address the needs of those with access needs so comprehensively, and hope that others will follow their example.\nThis award celebrates a small hotel group in Sri Lanka that is actively decarbonising its operations, showing that even smaller players can take meaningful steps towards sustainability and inspire others while doing so.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a tropical climate like Sri Lanka, air conditioning can consume up to 60% of a hotel's energy needs. Across its 19 hotels, Jetwing Hotels uses renewable energy from biomass, solar PV, solar thermal and biogas for power. In 2023, the hotel group generated the equivalent of the power needed for about 13,490 households through renewable energy alone. The company has also shortened its supply chain, reducing transport emissions, and is now sourcing 40% of their inputs locally to their hotels.\n\"By reducing energy costs and promoting a culture of environmental responsibility among our staff and guests, we ensure that our business practices are not only beneficial for the environment but also economically viable,\" said managing director Dmitri Cooray, \"Our success shows that even the smallest efforts can create a ripple effect, encouraging others to make impactful changes.\"\nThe award founders believe that the travel industry has a responsibility to contribute to the reversal of biodiversity loss and protect nature for future generations by promoting a regenerative approach to tourism. CREES, a Peruvian company offering tours and volunteering opportunities in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, is this year's winner of the Nature Positive award.\nThis educational tourism operation is working to benefit local people and conserve biodiversity at its three research stations in the Manu National Park that are home to one of the longest running and largest biodiversity studies in the Amazon. Guests get to witness conservation efforts first hand, exploring the rainforest in the company of the centre's naturalist guides, and participating in ongoing projects like checking pitfall traps, monitoring birdlife and taking visual surveys of reptiles and amphibians at night. Many of the projects monitor the life of the forest in newly regenerated forest areas, replanted by the team's conservationists, as a way to understand species recovery.\u00a0\nJudges were particularly impressed by how CREES approaches its work, citing its broad and holistic agenda aimed at promoting sustainable alternatives that respect human rights, intergenerational rights, biodiversity rights and the rights of species to ensure long-term sustainable economic development, as key factors in its win.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

The tribunal states that whether its decision has any benefit to the club, therefore, depends on whether the new APT rules are found to be lawful as part of the second challenge issued by the club last month. \n\"The League continues to believe that the new APT Rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter.\n\"The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to the Premier League for fair market value assessment.\"\nAPTs are commercial deals involving clubs and companies to which they have close ties. Restrictions on fair market values (FMVs) were introduced in December 2021, shortly after a Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle.\nThe Premier League has the right to assess the value of such deals to ensure they have not been inflated, which could give clubs more to spend under current financial rules.\nLast year, a tribunal ruled that low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the APTs. It also ruled that changes made to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\nFollowing the ruling, City criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion the regulations could be swiftly amended and said there should be no vote on changes before a further determination by the panel.\nHowever, in November, the Premier League voted through the amendments.\nThe Premier League said the rule changes related to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\nEarlier this month, City launched a fresh legal challenge, claiming the amendments are \"unlawful\".\nThe Premier League has already had to spend tens of millions of pounds on legal bills due to a range of recent disputes over its financial regulations. \nNow it faces the threat of further costs after a significant defeat that could lead to some clubs seeking compensation for what some sources believe could be dozens of commercial deals undervalued or rejected as a result of rules that have now been deemed to be unenforceable.\nWhile City feel vindicated by this ruling, the league's governance and ability to uphold its rulebook will now come under renewed scrutiny. But it could get worse for those in charge of the top-flight.\nIf the same arbitration panel decides that the amended set of rules are also void, the league could face a crisis.\nThere could be little preventing clubs like Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City and Saudi-owned Newcastle United from signing more lucrative deals with state-linked companies. While such clubs would welcome less restrictions on sponsorships and loans with 'associated parties', some rivals fear the league's competitive balance would be on the line.\nEnglish football is already braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the Premier League's separate disciplinary case against City.\nThe champions, who are facing 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches, deny any wrongdoing.\nBut the next few weeks could now feature another legal decision that also has a profound impact on the league's future direction.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Jamal Musiala has signed a new contract that will keep him at Bayern Munich until at least 2030\n\"People go to the stadium because of Jamal Musiala. He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn \u00a320.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. The release clause can be triggered for \u00a3145m before the final year of his contract and then goes down to \u00a383m.\nJust last week, it was revealed Kane also possesses certain release clauses that can be triggered before the respective ends of the January transfer windows to initiate a move for the summer.\nAs valuable as the England captain has been in his role as Bayern's top-notch goalscorer, the 31-year-old is obviously not seen as a long-term solution for Bayern, with an eventual return to the Premier League - where Kane could eventually break Alan Shearer's goalscoring record - appearing likely.\nMeanwhile, Musiala is 10 years younger than Kane and the perfect representative for Bayern, who have always been anxious to assemble the best German players, mixed with a number of high-profile talents from abroad.\nMusiala has already created countless moments of magic for Bayern, including his championship-clinching goal against Cologne in May 2023, when the team snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund during the final minutes of the season.\nMusiala played for England's youth teams but opted to represent Germany, the country of his birth\nWhen Musiala misses games or can only play a limited number of minutes due to an injury, his absence has been felt as the team does not look the same at all.\nBayern's 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Uefa Champions League earlier this season was a prime example.\nMusiala himself has talked about how he can be almost obsessed with improving his game through repetition and specialised training, for example practising certain shooting positions and movements.\n\"I just try to do everything that can take me to the next level,\" he said in 2023. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.\n\"I try to start at a young age with nutrition, the extra work so I can have more stamina, and then season by season, hopefully I get better.\"\nThere can be no doubt he has improved, instead of just resting on his natural talent as a footballer, and can do even further to put his name high among the world's best players in the future.\nIt is the reason why Musiala has just signed the most lucrative contract extension in German Bundesliga history.\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'",

        "article_text": "Dutch linguist Leonie Cornips has become fascinated with how cows communicate. But can this really be called 'language'?\nLeonie Cornips was long overdue for her coffee break. The chilly autumn air made a hot drink feel enticing. But Cornips was busy. She was a couple of hours into her work with a small herd of dairy cows. If she left now, she would lose something that would take time to recover. Cornips and the herd had entered a delicate, shared space she calls \"the rhythm of the cow\".\u00a0\nCornips is a sociolinguist at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scholars who pass through the institute's ornate doorway usually specialise in the study of Dutch language and culture. The soft-spoken researcher earned her academic laurels in the 1990s, and she still studies variations in syntax between different dialects in the Netherlands. But in addition to this, Cornips' work has more recently taken what professionals in the field call \"the animal turn\".\nFor years, Cornips has spent her summer holidays on a farm. She was struck from the start by the different personalities of individual cows. She read an essay by a philosopher that asked why linguists never study animals. It affected her deeply. Cornips felt that cows had the intelligence and social habits to be good research subjects for a linguist. As a Dutch person, she also knew they were cultural icons in a nation with a passion for cheese. So she turned her professional skills to cows.\nHumans have assumed for centuries that the ability to use language is a measure of our superiority. There is even an academic term for it: \"logocentrism\", meaning those who use words (from the Greek logos, meaning \"word\" or \"reason\") occupy a privileged position. Language, say many linguists, is what makes us human. Animals may grunt, bark or chirp, but they do not possess anything that counts as language.\nCornips is using her work with dairy cows to push back on this idea. It extends half a century of effort that began with Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees and Roger Payne's recording of humpback whales in the 1960s in an effort to show that humans may not be as linguistically unique as we had assumed.\nMany of Cornips' colleagues were sceptical when she suggested they apply the framework of linguistics to animals.\n\"The problem is people have no clear idea about language,\" she says. \"When they talk about language, they always refer to what comes out of the mouth.\" But after spending six years thoroughly immersed in the lives of cows, Cornips thinks that language is better understood as \"distributed\" between the mouth, body and surroundings, making it embodied, multi-modal and sensory. \"I'm eating with the cows, touching, kissing, walking, hugging,\" she says.\nMost research on cow language tend to focus on sounds. A 2015 study in the Netherlands, for example, looked at the pitch of cow sounds to see if they correlated with behaviours and concluded this could be a way to determine their welfare. And a 2019 Australian study found cows not only have distinctive individual vocalisations, but maintain these distinctive calls across a variety of contexts.\nCornips and the farmers she recruits to assist her record the frequency, duration and intensity of the sounds cows make. But she also focusses on the other ways meaning is expressed among bovines. Her methods are often ethnographic, a way of studying cultures that relies strongly on observation by the researcher. Cornips carefully observes cow behaviours and interactions alongside sound to determine how they communicate. \"I notice with cows that the body is an instrument to get to know the other,\" she says. Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".\nCows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says. This became obvious with Piet, a young male Fleckvieh from an intensively managed indoor facility who Cornips brought to join five other cows in an outdoor pasture.\u00a0\n\"I was always so happy to see him, that when I got into his meadow, I walked straight towards him and tried to touch him immediately,\" Cornips says. When she did so, Piet would back away.\nCornips gradually came to understand the need to respect Piet's personal space, as she might with a fellow human. She learned to keep her arms by her sides and only use eye contact intermittently, taking turns with Piet to look at each other and then look away. \"It took me quite a while,\" she says. \"I was very stupid. They are teaching me how to connect to them.\" Cornips realised she had to learn an etiquette. Without patience and attention, she says, you would never see it.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The scientists learning to speak whale\n\u2022\u00a0The sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet' revealed by AI\n\u2022\u00a0Is there something special about the human voice?\nPatience also turns out to be crucial when cows communicate with each other. When a mother calls her calf, it sometimes takes 60 seconds for the calf to respond. The space between is filled with bodily gestures. Studies from Austria show that ear positioning and neck-stretching are integral to cow language. Humans think of the ability to wiggle our ears as a party trick. For a cow, it appears to be fundamental to communication. The first sentence in a conversation with a cow is likely to involve movement of the ears and a look.\u00a0\u00a0\nCows are not the only animals being studied for their complex modes of communication. Michelle Fournet, an assistant professor specialising in marine acoustic ecology at the University of New Hampshire in the US, has learned it is unhelpful to impose human expectations on species like whales and seals.\nAnimals use sound completely differently from how humans use it, she says. \"If we are to do a good job at understanding how animals are communicating and why they are communicating, it behoves us to adopt their perspective.\"\nFournet stops short of using the word \"language\" to describe the information transfer taking place between non-humans. But she has gained a deep appreciation for the subtleties of animal communication. Their system is not less than ours, Fournet says, but other. We do them a disservice by searching for similarities.\u00a0\nOne difference between humans and many animals is their use of the environment. Cornips has found cow communication leans on its surroundings more than ours. She observed one herd where individuals used their bodies to bang on an iron fence to communicate with the rest of the herd at feeding time, which she views as a type of language. She noticed cows responding to her differently depending on whether she entered a barn with solid walls or open sides: since cows on different farms are surrounded by different physical features, this offers distinctive opportunities for linguistic expression. Cows, she argues, develop diverse languaging practices \u2013 almost like dialects \u2013 where meaning depends on the shape of their surroundings.\nLike other domestic animals, cows face the additional challenge of interspecies communication with humans. \"Most farmers are not sensitive to the rhythm of the cow,\" says Cornips. \"The cows must obey the rhythm of the farmer.\" Dairy herds are constantly shunted between feeding, milking and grazing grounds. If a cow does not learn the daily routine or fails to be productive, it goes to the slaughterhouse. She is shocked by how readily people assume cows are stupid.\u00a0\n\"In becoming a dairy cow,\" she says, \"they must have very rich communicative skills because they have to understand what the farmer wants them to do\u2026 which is not easy.\"\nCornips has analysed recordings to show that cows will simplify their vocalisation once a farmer recognises their need. Rather than having their intelligence bred out of them to be more compliant, Cornips thinks domestic animals are forced to develop a fuller communication repertoire than wild animals.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf dairy cows have complex linguistic practices, it's tempting to ask how they stack up against the other great communicators in the animal kingdom. How would they compare, for example, to humpback whales? Cornips admires the complex vocalisations found in whale song. Humpbacks are among the cetaceans known to develop different dialects in different regions. They also communicate over vast distances. (Read more about the sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language which researchers are uncovering in whale communication).\nBut Cornips points out that whales lack some of the capacities of cows. A whale's ears are not as moveable as a cow's, she says. They also lack hooves. \"Whales cannot express themselves bodily very much,\" Cornips says. \"In that way they may be [less complex] than cows.\"\nFournet says she does not believe it makes sense to rank animal communication by its complexity. \"There isn't an answer to what you are looking for,\" she told me when I asked her to compare whales to cows.\nMany traditional linguists are still hesitant to ascribe language to non-humans. Leora Bar-el, a linguistics professor at the University of Montana in the US, is not hostile to the idea of animal language but thinks it worth asking what we gain and what we lose by expanding the definition of language to include cows.\n\"We may lose the fact there is something unique about human language,\" she says. For example, human language permits incredible creativity. Think of the works of Shakespeare. It can also refer to distant events and even reflect back on itself, as language does when it provides a definition.\nBut Eva Meijer, author of the essay that first inspired Cornips and the 2018 book Animal Languages, argues such claims can be self-fulfilling. \"What we see as language has been developed by excluding the language of other animals,\" she says. In fact, we define language in a way that makes it easy to deny it to others. Meijer points out the long history of human oppression associated with denying other people their language. She believes that recognising language in animals provides new tools for understanding them and perhaps even for learning how to inhabit the planet more sustainably.\nCornips, though, does not put an animal rights agenda at the centre of her work. She is focused primarily on expanding the field of linguistics. But the implications are hard to ignore. Cows may have more complex social lives than we thought. Her research reveals numerous additional avenues for exploration. How much does language contribute to distinctive bovine communities and cultures? What sort of planning can cows do with each other? Can they use language to pass on knowledge between generations?\nThe answers to these questions could change how we regard the lives of many animals. When 96% of the weight of mammals on earth is made up of humans and domesticated livestock, understanding better what cattle, sheep and chickens are communicating could lead to improved relationships with them, as well as better lives for animals.\u00a0\nCornips knows things are unlikely to change fast. Recently, though, she has noticed the idea that animals have language has become more common in academic journals.\nShe hopes linguistics can be a tool for unlocking different attitudes. \"My most important goal,\" she says, \"is to show others that you can look with different eyes at a domestic animal.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".Cows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says.",

It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings. They already tell us what to say on the radio.\n\"But when you hear that passion, those words, even if sometimes we swear on the radio, for me that's a keeper in F1 and it is something we shouldn't get rid of.\"\nThe FIA has not explained how the new system will be applied, but last year president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said he wanted to stop drivers swearing while driving.\nSainz said the drivers have not had any clarification from the FIA.\nHe and Albon both drove Williams' new 2025 car as it was unveiled at Silverstone on Friday.\nVerstappen restricts answers after 'ridiculous' swearing punishment\nFerrari's Leclerc fined for swearing in news conference\nF1 drivers ask FIA to treat them like adults\nSainz explained that his first impressions were \"positive\", and he said Williams' willingness to host a day for media and sponsors and give the car its debut at the same time was indicative of the progress the team had made.\nLast year, the team struggled at the start of the season as attempts to introduce new processes in the team delayed the car build. A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's future is the focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), just days after a shock phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the Ukraine war.\nDescribing the call earlier this week as \"great\", Trump said there was a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war\". \nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country must not be left out of any peace talks.\nEuropean allies seemed surprised at the nature of the call, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning that any peace agreement which involved capitulating to Russia would end \"badly for everyone\".\nIt is still unclear when peace negotiations could begin, but when they do issues around territory, security negotiations and Ukraine's future in Nato will be among the key topics for discussion. Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "From the return of HBO's holiday-resort satire to a political thriller starring Robert De Niro and the latest violent period drama from Peaky Blinders creator Stephen Knight.\nAfter Jane Austen died, in 1817, her sister, Cassandra, destroyed many of her letters, guarding her privacy and setting generations of Janeites' and scholars' hair on fire. Miss Austen, based on Gill Hornby's bestselling novel, imagines what might have been behind all that. The series is wonderfully cast, with Keeley Hawes as Cassandra. It begins years after Jane's death, when Cassandra visits Isabella Fowle (Rose Leslie), \u00a0the niece of her long-dead fianc\u00e9, with the secret purpose of trying to find letters from Jane that might be in the vicarage. In flashbacks, Synnove Karlsen is the younger Cassandra and Patsy Ferran the young Jane. Max Irons and Alfred Enoch are also in the cast, because an Austen story always needs romance. Hawes teased the show in an interview with the Guardian, saying: \u201cIt feels like a classic costume drama, in the vein of Colin Firth in\u00a0Pride and Prejudice. Modern takes like Bridgerton are brilliant, but this feels like part of the Austen canon, so her fans will be pleased.\" The Austen industry is in overdrive this year, the 250th anniversary of her birth, but few projects are as tempting as this.\nMiss Austen premieres 2 February on BBC in the UK and 4 May on PBS in the US\nKaitlyn Dever, who has been great at comedy (Booksmart) and drama (2019 miniseries Unbelievable), takes on a bit of both in this fictional version of a true story. She plays Belle Gibson, an Australian influencer and con woman, who falsely said she had brain cancer and was curing it with natural ingredients and lifestyle, turning that lie into a financial empire selling apps and cookbooks. The show goes beyond her to include four other women in her orbit. One of them is under her spell, another becomes a business rival. The series is set in the early 2010s, at the dawn of Instagram, and tackles the rise of social media influencers. You can guess at its appeal. The show seems to echo the Netflix hit Inventing Anna, with Julia Garner as Anna Delvey, who masqueraded as an heiress, and was convicted of grand larceny and theft of services for her cons.\nApple Cider Vinegar premieres 6 February on Netflix internationally\nLaverne Cox stars in one of the last projects executive produced by the comedy legend Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at 101. She plays Desiree, a New York art gallery owner whose business collapses, and who returns home to Mobile, Alabama after 23 years away. Putting a new gender spin on some old sitcom tropes, the premise is that her father, Harry (comedian George Wallace), a car-wash owner she hasn't spoken to in all that time, has no idea that the child he thought of as his son has transitioned. Desiree moves into her old room, and the odd-couple, city-girl-in-a-small-town jokes begin, including one that has Harry putting money in a \"Pronoun Jar\" whenever he accidentally calls Desiree \"son\". Cox has been a staple of red carpet awards coverage lately. However this series turns out, it's probably time to remember how good she was in Orange is the New Black.\nClean Slate premieres 6 February on Amazon Prime\nThis drama about the decades-long aftershocks from a high-school soccer team's plane crash is another show returning after such a long gap, almost two years, that you need a refresher course before watching. Last season, as if being stranded in the woods and resorting to cannibalism when they were teenage girls wasn't enough, the adult versions of the characters faced life-or-death horror at the isolated location where Lottie (Simone Kessell) has formed a cult. As the adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey, the show's anchor) says in the third season trailer, \"Someone wants us dead\". Whoever it is already got poor Natalie in season two. The back-and-forth in time continues, with the main cast returning, including Lauren Ambrose as the adult Van, and Liv Hewson as her younger self, Christina Ricci as adult Misty, always up to something suspicious, and Elijah Wood as Walter, her demented citizen-sleuth colleague. Hilary Swank makes some guest appearances in the present day timeline. All we know so far is that she is already drenched in blood.\nYellowjackets premieres 14 February on Paramount Plus with Showtime in the US and Paramount Plus in the UK\nSeason three of Mike White's mordant social satire is set at the White Lotus resort in Thailand, and now there are snakes and monkeys along with the usual emotional upheaval. Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the spa manager at the Hawaii White Lotus in the first season, returns to take a training course at the new location. This time the guests include three old friends on a girls' trip, played by Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb, along with Jason Isaacs and Parker Posey as a married couple. Lalisa Manobal, better known as Lisa from the South Korean group Blackpink, plays Mook, a health and wellness counsellor at the resort, where health and wellness are undoubtedly in short supply.\u00a0\nThe White Lotus premieres 16 February on HBO and Max in the US and 17 February on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK\nThis political thriller starring Robert De Niro is intriguing and timely. When a cyberattack hits the US, causing devastation and deaths, former president George Mullen (De Niro) is called in to head a commission investigating the source, working against a barrage of problems and forces: big tech, Wall Street, rival political factions and a world of disinformation. Connie Britton plays Mullen's former chief of staff and Jesse Plemons is a former aide with political ambitions of his own. Joan Allen plays Mullen's wife, and Lizzy Caplan their daughter, a member of Congress. The plot deals with the slippery nature of truth itself. \"That's the spine of my character in the show,\" De Niro has said. \"Don't dodge anything. Don't play games. Be honest about what's going on so that the public knows what's going on.\" Angela Bassett plays the US president in casting that would have landed very differently if the US election had gone another way.\nZero Day premieres 20 February on Netflix internationally\nIn this animated family series from Pixar, eight members of a middle-school co-ed softball team, the Portland Pickles, are preparing for a championship game, with Will Forte as the voice of Coach Dan. Each episode focuses on a different character, from the school-age players to parents and coaches, and looks at their individual hopes, fears and insecurities, in a show whose message is to consider other people's points of view. There was recently a flutter of attention to the series for an extraneous reason, though, after word emerged that lines of dialogue identifying one character as transgender had been cut. Chanel Stewart, the 18-year-old trans actress who voices that character, told Deadline she was \"very disheartened\", and that \"I was excited to share my journey to help empower other trans youth\". In a statement, Disney said, \"When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we realize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.\"\nWin or Lose premieres 19 February on Disney+\nSteven Knight, the creator of Peaky Blinders, is right in his wheelhouse with another period piece about a criminal gang inspired by real-life stories, this time set in Victorian London and the world of illegal bare-knuckle boxing. Hezekiah (Malachi Kirby of Small Axe) and his friend Alec (Francis Lovehall, also of Small Axe) are Jamaicans who have come to London and who try to seek their fortunes as boxers. Hezekiah finds himself taken up and exploited by Mary Carr, the leader of the all-female band of robbers known as The Forty Elephants. Erin Doherty, who played Princess Anne as a young woman in The Crown, is far from that role as Carr. Stephen Graham stars as a boxer named Sugar Goodman, determined to defend his turf from the upstart Hezekiah. The stalwart Graham has played plenty of gritty characters, in Peaky Blinders and recently in Blitz, but had to bulk up for this role. \"Five meals a day, loads of protein, ice baths, I became like a proper athlete,\" he told Empire.\nA Thousand Blows premieres 21 February on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\nDavid Attenborough's nature documentaries have proven there is an apparently bottomless appetite for the genre. This variation stands apart because it has Tom Hanks narrating, with a sense of wonder. The series is an ambitious 10-part look at the Americas, with each episode focusing on a different area, ranging from Canada to Patagonia, the Atlantic coast to the Amazon. The production was epic, with 180 expeditions that took five years, making it what is likely the most expensive non-fiction show Universal Studios has ever done. Universal co-produced the show with the BBC, which also produces the Attenborough series. The music is composed by Oscar-winner Hans Zimmer, whose movie scores include Gladiator and Dune. But the soundtrack here also includes animal sounds, waves, and Hanks luring viewers in by saying, \"A wandering salamander. To find a mate he sets out on an extraordinary journey.\"\nThe Americas premieres 23 February on NBC in the US and in 2025 on BBC One in the UK\nAs Taylor Sheridan's prequel to his mega-hit series Yellowstone returns, the presence of either Harrison Ford or Helen Mirren might be enough to make you want to watch, and despite the near-death of Ford's character in season one, this series still has both. They are back as Jacob and Cara Dutton, who are enduring an especially hard winter on that familiar Montana ranch, not to mention the threat from an evil land-baron played by Timothy Dalton. Meanwhile, their nephew Spencer (Brandon Sklenar), is heading back from his African safari to help out, and Spencer's wife, Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer), an aristocrat from the UK, is trying to get across the Atlantic to her new home on the range (culture shock awaits). Ford growls in the teaser trailer, \"This ranch is under attack. Our whole way of life is under attack,\" which is pretty much an all-purpose Dutton line, available to use in any Yellowstone iteration.\n1923 premieres 23 February in the US and 24 February in the UK on Paramount+\nSuits, which ran on cable channel USA Network from 2011 to 2019, turned out to be an ideal show to binge. When the series about a firm of high-powered New York lawyers landed on Netflix, it became one of the most streamed series of 2023. We may never know how much that had to do with one of its stars being Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex. We do know that she is not in this spinoff set on the opposite coast. Neither is the rest of that cast (so far), with the exception of some guest appearances by Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter. The main character now is Ted Black (Stephen Amell), a former federal prosecutor in New York now running a powerful Los Angeles firm specialising in criminal and entertainment law. Aaron Korsh, the creator of Suits, also created the LA version. At first it was a different series, about Hollywood agents, which NBC passed on. He reconfigured that idea to exist in the same universe as Suits, and here we are.\nSuits LA premieres 23 February on NBC in the US\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",
