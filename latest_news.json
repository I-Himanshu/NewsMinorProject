Next step is Champions League and now the focus is there.\"\nEven more exciting for Villa fans is the understanding he appears to be developing with Marcus Rashford, another winter window signing after the England forward joined on loan from Manchester United.\nHe provided the assist for Asensio's opener against Cardiff, meaning all three of his assists for Villa so far have been for goals scored by the Spanish midfielder.\n\"Marcus [Rashford] is a top player,\" Asensio added. \n\"We are together not so much but I know what he wants to do, where he passes and I am very happy to have Marcus and all of the team-mates.\"\nMarco Asensio has scored four goals in six games for Aston Villa\nAsensio was perhaps destined to be a footballer, with his father having named him after legendary Netherlands striker Marco van Basten.\nBut the 29-year-old has forged an impressive career in his own right. \nAfter starting out at Mallorca, he had a spell at Espanyol before joining Real Madrid, where he helped the Spanish giants with La Liga four times and the Champions League three times.\nIn total he won 17 trophies at Real, as many as a player considered one of the greatest in world football - Alfredo Di Stefano.\nAfter seven seasons at Real he made the move to French giants PSG, helping them to win a domestic treble last year.\nGiven the success he has enjoyed, joining a club not currently challenging for league titles no doubt raised an eyebrow.\nBut Unai Emery has been a long-time admirer of Asensio and played a key role in his signing.\n\"Unai has tried to get Asensio in at least three windows,\" Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.\n\"He has always said to Unai he wanted to work with him and develop with him.\"\nThe clincher for Emery appears to have been the promise of playing Asensio in the number 10 position.\n\"He hasn't played there since Mallorca,\" added Balague.  \n\"At Madrid he wasn't allowed, so that was the discussion he had with Unai. He was told number 10 and you can see the good consequences of it.\"\nAsensio is not the only player who is flourishing since moving to Aston Villa, with Rashford appearing to be putting behind him a difficult season at Manchester United with a strong start to life in the Midlands.\nRashford had been struggling for form at Old Trafford and found himself out of the picture under Ruben Amorim.\nBut the move to Villa and playing alongside Asensio appears to bringing him back to his best.\nSince his debut on 9 February, Rashford has created more chances in all competitions than any other Premier League player (13).\nAgainst Cardiff, Rashford created six chances for Aston Villa, equalling the most he ever created in any of his 426 matches for Manchester United (six vs Wigan in January 2024).\nHe has yet to score, although given his performances so far that will surely come sooner rather than later.\n\"Aston Villa have given him a lifeline,\" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on ITV Sport. \n\"It seems to have come to an end at Manchester United. He needed to rebuild his confidence, he is 27 and has to show he has a lot to give. Villa have given him a good opportunity.\n\"Things could be very exciting here at Aston Villa with this new exciting Aston Villa forward line.\"\nWith a Champions League last-16 game at Club Brugge up next, Emery believes Asensio and Rashford maintaining their form is key to Villa achieving their ambitions this season.\n\"We need [Asensio] and we need Rashford,\" he said.\n\"We need the players who joined in the last window.

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise L\u00fcbeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot \u2013 a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nThe 21-year-old, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nEdie points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nAlso involved in the film was Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance.\nShe says Madison installed a pole at her house in LA, and the pair began working on her \"sexy routine\".\n\"She put in so much work,\" Schneider, 28, said. \"She was so determined.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent.

Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

But we will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\"\nTariffs are a tax on imports that is collected by the government and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods. \nTrump has vowed to use the levies to boost US manufacturing, raise money and push other countries to change policies he opposes. \nBut there are concerns such measures could fuel inflation, with warnings that Americans could face higher prices for goods as businesses may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.\nSince taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom \"reciprocal\" tariffs for each country.\nBut he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats.\n\"The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \n\"It's a number that's concerning - certainly should be concerning - for the trans-Atlantic trade relationship, but not totally out of the blue.\"\nAntonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a \"difficult\" but \"not an impossible\" situation for Germany's economy.\n\"We are worried but we shouldn't be afraid,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nGermany's car industry's products are popular in the US.\nMr Finkelnburg said many German car manufacturers were \"already producing in the American market, so they wouldn't be directly affected by the tariffs\", but said tariffs would still drive up prices.\n\"The car parts that are manufactured in to those cars are crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada several times so that already is driving the prices up,\" he added.\nEarlier this month, Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, America's top two trading partners. But he suspended the duties before they went into effect until 4 March, to allow for talks on border security. \nOn Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect \"on schedule\". \nAt Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April.\nThat is the same day that the Commerce Department is supposed to deliver its wider recommendations for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that \"the overall is April 2\" , distinguishing between tariffs tied to concerns about drug trafficking and migration from Mexico and Canada.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all headed lower in mid-day trade, while the peso and Canadian dollar gained.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass. \nWhen asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.\" \nHowever, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.\nIn public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops. \n\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.\nAccording to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.\nPresident Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests. \nHe suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?\nThe short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.\nBritain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending. \nBut Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.\nInstead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.  \nThat force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.\n\nBut these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".\nOfficials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nIt could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.\nWhile Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.\nEuropean nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics. \nNato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough. \nBut the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.\nEurope's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.\nFrance is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.\nSir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

Trump has lauded the \"very big agreement\" as an opportunity for the US to get its \"money back\" after funding aid to Ukraine. \nBut Zelensky has instead referred to it as a \"framework agreement\" upon which he hopes further deals can be made.\nTrump has said he wants a quick end to the war in Ukraine and has sought to reset relations with Russia. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two leaders sent delegations to Saudi Arabia in bilateral talks which excluded Ukraine. \nIn response, Zelensky accused the US of helping Putin \"break out of years of isolation\" and Trump of living in a \"Russian disinformation space\". \nUkraine is a country rich in natural resources. Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are there. But accessing some of these resources will not be completely straightforward. \nSome of the mineral deposits have been seized by Russia.

She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California.\n\"It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren't even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,\" she says.\n\"If I'm honest, I didn't think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn't even anything major.\n\"So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family.\n\"I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn't have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family.\"\nThe day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself.\nIt was a period she describes as \"one of the hardest times in my life\".\nShe says: \"It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game.\n\"I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out.\n\"My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego.\"\nCasey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018\nIt took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney's consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and \"our lives\". They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim.\n\"[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time.\"\nShe also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities.\n\"It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn't have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds.\"\nThe ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women's Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time.\nBut then along came the Canada job.\nAt first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she \"loves\", which is working with players day to day.\nYet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months.\n\"I really liked that it was extensive,\" she says. \"It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me.\"\nThat included speaking to the manager of the men's team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game.\nAnd she was impressed \u2013 by the organisation's leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role.\n\"When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn't have to move,\" she said.\n\"That's been really, really beneficial for us as a family. I don't think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you're in a privileged position, but it's the impact on your family it has.\n\"I had young children that just didn't understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I'd contributed to that, which was difficult.\n\"There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn't have a job. There were some I would have been interested in, some I wouldn't have been interested in, but as soon as I got involved in this process it became clear I was really interested in this [and] I was only committed to one thing.\"\nCasey Stoney took charge of Canada for the first time in February, overseeing two wins and one draw in the Pinatar Cup in Spain\nShe is taking over a country who are ranked sixth in the world but have experienced their own turmoil.\nDuring last summer's Paris Olympics, in which Canada reached the quarter-finals, two members of the team's coaching staff were sent home for flying a drone over a training session held by New Zealand, their opponents in a group game.\nTheir head coach Bev Priestman, another Englishwoman, was given a year-long ban by world governing body Fifa and Canada - who had won Olympic gold at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games - were docked six points.\nPriestman \"did reach out and wish me luck\" says Stoney, but they have had no other communication and the new Canada coach is keen to focus on the future, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon.\nShe met the majority of her players for the first time over the last two weeks as Canada competed in a four-team tournament, the Pinatar Cup, in Spain, which they won following a 7-0 thrashing of Chinese Taipei, a 2-0 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with China.\n\"This team excites me,\" she says. \"I do think they've got so much potential.\n\"What they were able to achieve last year in difficult circumstances shows what they're capable of, but there's so much more to come.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Plymouth have already shocked Brentford and Liverpool in the FA Cup this season, but can they upset another Premier League team, Manchester City, in round five?\n\"Argyle have gone really direct under new manager Miron Muslic,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"It's a great clash of styles with the possession football that Pep Guardiola plays, but the problem if you keep going long against City is that you keep giving them the ball back.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all eight fifth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against comedian and Plymouth fan Josh Widdicombe.\nWiddicombe is touring the UK with his 'Not My Cup Of Tea' stand-up show in 2025 and 2026, which culminates with two nights at the Hackney Empire in London.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nWiddicombe co-hosts the Parenting Hell podcast with Rob Beckett and recently triumphed on BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special\nJosh missed Plymouth's famous win over Liverpool in round four because he was at a Strictly Come Dancing Live Show with his daughter, so will he be at Etihad Stadium this weekend?\n\"No, I will be in Chipping Norton, doing a preview show for my tour,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"My on-stage time will be 7.30pm which would be when injury time starts. That's life!\n\"I was actually disappointed we got City because when you get into the fifth round of the FA Cup, you start thinking that, if we get an easy draw, we are in the quarter-finals. \n\"So, City were the worst possible draw, really. The fact the FA Cup is the only thing they can win doesn't help much either. If they were playing in the Champions League next week we would be in a slightly better position.\n\"Still, the longer we go without conceding, the more I will dare to dream. I would obviously take penalties now, in a heartbeat, even though I would be on stage.\n\"Although, by the time penalties happen, after all the injury time and extra time, it might be around 8.15pm, which is when my break usually is.\n\"That's what I am going to be wishing for, because I might just get to see a shootout - but honestly let's just hope the tie is still up for grabs when I go on stage.\"\nWiddicombe (right) poses with famous Bolton fan Vernon Kay before the 2023 Papa Johns Trophy final - the last time Plymouth reached Wembley. Sadly for Josh, the Pilgrims lost 4-0\nJosh co-hosted the cult podcast about 1990s football 'Quickly Kevin, Will He Score?' between 2017 and 2024 and feels that decade was full of classic FA Cup moments.\n\"There were lots of iconic finals in the 1990s,\" he added. \"I can instantly tell you the result and every goalscorer of every one, while I am struggling to tell you who won it last year.\n\"That's because of a combination of two things - firstly, in the same way you remember what was Christmas number one when you were a kid, everything is more vivid the first time around - it is more exciting and seems to matter more.\n\"Also, sadly, the FA Cup is not nearly as important as it was. You've even got some Plymouth fans saying they would rather stay up than win it this season - my response to that is 'are you clinically insane? Who cares if we stay up!'.\n\"In a few years you are not going to say 'oh thank God we are in the Championship. You are going to go 'can you remember when we won the FA Cup!?!' That's what you dream about.\n\"Those one-off events are the things you cling on to, and in a strange way I am glad that because I wasn't able to go to our win over Liverpool, I was at Strictly Live with my daughter instead.\n\"That makes it more of a memory for me. I will always remember where I was when it happened, and it wasn't just the case where I was at home watching on TV and then I had to go to the park.\"\nChris Sutton and Josh Widdicombe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nAston Villa 2-0 Cardiff City\n10th in Premier League v 19th in Championship\nGap = 29\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe rest of the season is going to be a bit of a juggling act for Aston Villa.\nThey are still in the Champions League and also trying to finish high enough in the Premier League to qualify for it again next season.\nSo, it will be interesting to see if they target the FA Cup too. I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.\nStill, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.\nLet's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.\nCardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.\nThey may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nJosh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. \nSo, there is quite a lot in this for them while, in contrast, if any of the Championship teams are going to be focused on the league it is Cardiff. 3-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup moment: It would probably be Wrexham beating Arsenal in 1992 with Mickey Thomas's free-kick for their equaliser. I don't like Wrexham now because they are the big dogs of the lower leagues but that was the iconic upset of my childhood.\nIt was probably the first big one that I saw for myself. When I was a kid, all the same FA Cup upsets used to get talked about all the time - like Hereford against Newcastle - but this was the first proper one I remember, after Arsenal had won the league and Wrexham had finished bottom.\nThis video can not be played\nFA Cup Archive: Wrexham upset Arsenal in 1992\nCrystal Palace 3-1 Millwall\n12th in Premier League v 12th in Championship\nGap = 8\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWill in-form Crystal Palace go for it in the FA Cup? I really hope so.\nOliver Glasner's side have improved as the season has gone on and they are comfortably in mid-table of the Premier League without any danger of going down. A cup run would really cap this as a successful campaign for him.\nIt would have an even bigger impact for Palace's fans. I still remember Ian Wright's goals in the 1990 final where they lost to Manchester United in a replay. They lost to United in the 2016 final too, and it would be great to give them a new memory.\nThis won't be easy, because former Norwich boss Alex Neil took charge of Millwall at the end of last year and is doing a good job.\nThey have been quite stubborn in recent weeks and I'm expecting more of the same here, but the Eagles should edge it in normal time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: We beat Millwall 5-1 off the back of of our win over Liverpool, which was a bit of a freak result. Normally you'd lose straight after that kind of game. \nLike Villa, Palace are another team who should be going for the FA Cup but Millwall have reached the final in my lifetime, even if it was fully 21 years ago. \nI'd gone for a replay at first, before I remembered there aren't any - the death of FA Cup replays is very sad, isn't it? 1-1 after extra time, then Millwall to win on penalties\nPreston North End 3-0 Burnley\n15th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\nGap = 12\nWatch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nThis will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.\nIt ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.\nMaybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?\nBurnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.\nPreston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.\nLet's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penalties\nJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support. \nBurnley in contrast are one of the six teams that are forever going to switch between the Premier League and the Championship. They are trying to win promotion this time by not conceding any goals whatsoever, which is different, but still not very exciting for their fans. \nThis is a local derby, but it is such a dry game. I'll go 1-0 to Burnley - no, 1-0 to Preston. 1-0\nBournemouth 1-1 Wolves (Bournemouth win 5-4 on penalties)\n7th in Premier League v 17th in Premier League\nGap = 10\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWolves won here in the Premier League on Saturday but only after Bournemouth had Illia Zabarnyi sent off in the first half. That completely skewed that result so I am not using it as a form guide for this tie.\nWhat will be more relevant is how many changes both teams make for this game. \nI was at Wolves' win over Blackburn in round four and their manager Vitor Pereira went kind of half-strong there. I can guarantee you he will be prioritising Premier League survival ahead of FA Cup progress, so we will probably see another mix-and-match selection from him here too.\nAs for Bournemouth, well I have already talked about why Crystal Palace should be trying to win the FA Cup this season, and the same definitely applies to Andoni Iraola's side.\nThe Cherries have only reached the quarter-finals twice before, losing at that stage in 1957 and 2021, and their best moments in the competition are probably as a lower-league giantkiller, such as when they beat Manchester United as a third-tier team in 1984.\nThis year they are genuine contenders to win it and lift the club's first major trophy, and they have already shown they can beat anyone, especially at home. \nThey are still seventh in the Premier League despite losing their past two matches, and I would be really disappointed - no, actually I'd be angry - if Iraola picks a weakened team in the situation they are in.\nHe has got a responsibility to the fans to try to reach the semi-finals for the first time. Yes they have got a chance of making the Champions League, which would be incredible, but they are only two wins away from their biggest day out ever at Wembley. Why not go for it?\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: Usually, the result never recurs when teams play each other twice in a short space of time, so I am backing Bournemouth. 2-0\nManchester City 3-1 Plymouth Argyle \n4th in Premier League v 22nd in Championship\nGap = 38\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe FA Cup is Manchester City's only realistic chance of a trophy this season, so there is no chance they will lack focus here.\nCity come into this tie off the back of a good win at Tottenham on Wednesday, which I predicted. The readers went for a Spurs victory, which was just ridiculous - what on earth were you thinking?\nI am going for Pep Guardiola's side to win this comfortably, but fair play to Plymouth for getting this far.\nThey have knocked out Liverpool and won at Brentford but it is going to be third time unlucky for them against Premier League teams.\nWith what is at stake for them, City cannot let this one slip - and they won't.\nSutton's prediction: 5-0\nJosh's prediction: I think it is absurd when fans predict victories for their own team. They do it all the time, while I just go into every game thinking we are going to lose - that is my attitude to life, that surely this is going to go wrong.\nSo, I think we are going to lose every game 4-0, which actually feels like a worthwhile prediction here. Then you are always pleasantly surprised - well, maybe not always, but most of the time - when you don't. \nWe have played very, kind of, pretty football for the past five years but under our new manager, our playing style is, shall we say, a little more industrial these days.\nIt's much worse when you are at home trying to break down a team in the Championship but it is perfect for this scenario, away at Manchester City. We are practising the right type of football to cause an FA Cup upset but the truth of it is that we are not going to win, so who cares!? 4-0\nJosh on who will win the FA Cup? I obviously want Plymouth to win it but I think City will do it. So, in a way, this is one of those games where people say 'this is the real final'. Whoever wins out of Plymouth and City will go on and win the FA Cup.\nSt James' Park, 13:45 GMT\n6th in Premier League v 8th in Premier League\nGap = 2\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nAlexander Isak missed Newcastle's defeat at Anfield with a groin injury so he has to be a doubt for this tie too, and his absence is a massive blow for Eddie Howe's side.\nBrighton have hit a bit of form since losing 7-0 to Nottingham Forest at the start of February, and have won four in a row in the Premier League and FA Cup.\nThe Seagulls also won at St James' Park earlier in the season, when Danny Welbeck got the winner. I remember that one because I got that prediction wrong.\nPeople are talking about Newcastle being distracted by their upcoming Carabao Cup final against Liverpool [on 16 March] but could they actually be in line for a domestic cup double this season?\nI am banking on them keeping that possibility alive here. They obviously could really do with having Isak back but, even if he is not fit, then surely Brighton can't win there twice this season... can they?\nSutton's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Newcastle are never going to win the FA Cup - they are always constantly about to win the FA Cup, and about to win their first trophy. I mean obviously they have got the Carabao Cup final coming up but, no, Newcastle will never win the FA Cup. Brighton are quite a 1980s team, aren't they, because of when they reached the Cup final in 1983? Let's see that again. 1-2\nOld Trafford, 16:30 GMT\n14th in Premier League v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nI am sick of backing Manchester United. Even though they beat Ipswich on Wednesday, they did not half make hard work of it and the Tractor Boys ran them close at Old Trafford.\nAlejandro Garnacho appeared to have a bit of a hissy fit after being hooked before half-time, so it will be interesting to see how Ruben Amorim deals with that. He won't have any players left at this rate if he decides to leave Garnacho out.\nUnited are the FA Cup holders and they have beaten Fulham home and away already this season but on both occasions it was far from convincing, and I don't really care about that anyway.\nAmorim is a likeable guy, and I've got sympathy for him about the size of his task at Old Trafford but, from watching United, I cannot think of any reason to back them to win this. \nI am usually wrong about Fulham, but they are going to take this one - 100%.\nSutton's prediction: 0-3\nJosh's prediction: I can see United getting to the cup final this year. They were quite jammy on their way to winning it last year - against Coventry in the semi-final for example - but were they actually jammy? It meant they kept Erik ten Hag for another six months which is probably the worst thing which could have happened to them. I don't know if that FA Cup win has made this season much worse. 2-0\nCity Ground, 19:30 GMT\n3rd in Premier League v 18th in Premier League\nGap = 15\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna made 11 changes when his side beat Coventry in round four and I suspect he will do something similar here.\nYou might have heard about 'Sutton's Super Computer', which were the calculations I did for the Monday Night Club this week, where I worked out the results of all the remaining Premier League fixtures.\nAccording to my secret formula, which is obviously extremely scientific, the Tractor Boys only have an outside chance of staying up. Along with Leicester they were in my 'no-hopers' category.\nMaybe Ipswich can surprise me and go on an FA Cup run, but you have to fancy Nottingham Forest here.\nDefeat would just leave a grim fight against relegation for McKenna's side, so I feel for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who regular readers will know follows the Tractor Boys, but not so much for my 5 Live colleague Ali Bruce-Ball who is a phony Ipswich supporter - when I asked him, he could not remember the last time he went to watch them as a fan.\nOne thing I really can't stand are people like Bruce who attach themselves to a club which has a bit of success, claiming some tenuous link from the past.\nMy boyhood team Forest may make changes too because they are still in a good position for a Champions League spot, but I am backing Chris Wood to come off the bench and get us a winner.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Forest are another throwback team who do not seem to have had a decent Cup run for a long time. 2-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup final of the 1990s: Spurs versus Forest in 1991 was a really important and seismic one, because of Gazza [Paul Gascoigne] and what it did to his career. \nThere were some other great ones too, though, like 1997 when Middlesbrough lost to Chelsea. That was quite fun because of Roberto di Matteo's goal after 47 seconds. \nThen there was 1995 when Manchester United lost to Everton after they had been going for the Double and lost everything, and even 1993 was interesting because Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday met in both domestic cup finals. I'm not going to, but you could write a book about the history of 90s football based around those finals, because they mattered so much then.\nChris has six correct results from the nine midweek Premier League games played so far in week 27, with one exact score, giving him 90 points.\nWith one game still to be played, he is level with his guest, singer Paige Cavell, who also has six correct results with one exact score.\nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, the BBC readers got three correct results with no exact scores, giving them 30 points.\nThey can no longer win this week, but the outcome of Thursday's game between West Ham and Leicester will decide whether Chris or Paige takes the victory.\nChris has gone for a 2-0 Hammers success while Paige has picked a 1-1 draw.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's president had been hoping to leave the White House on Friday after positive talks with Donald Trump, capped with the signing of a minerals deal giving the US a real stake in his country's future, if not an outright security guarantee.\nInstead Volodymyr Zelensky faced an extraordinary dressing down in front of the world's media, after President Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance demanded that he show more gratitude for years of US support.\nThe Ukrainian president pushed back at suggestions from his more powerful partners that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. They responded that he was being \"disrespectful\".\nZelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early before he and Trump could even take the stage for a scheduled news conference.\nAnd the minerals deal, which had been trailed and praised by both sides this week, was left unsigned. \"Come back when you're ready for peace,\" Trump wrote on social media shortly before Zelensky's car pulled away.\nThere were several major flashpoints in the meeting. Here are four of the most fiery - and the politics and feeling that lies behind them.\nWhile there was half an hour of cordial talks and formalities at the start, tensions began to boil over in the Oval Office when Vance said the \"path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy\".\n\"That's what President Trump is doing,\" he said.\nZelensky interjected, referencing Russia's aggression in the years before its full-scale invasion three years ago including a failed ceasefire in 2019. \"Nobody stopped him,\" he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you talking about? What do you mean?\" he said. \nThe exchange then became visibly tense, with Vance replying: \"the kind that will end the destruction of your country.\"\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the American media.\nIt was Vance's defence of Trump's approach to ending the war - by opening communications with Putin and pushing for a quick ceasefire - that first escalated tensions with the Ukrainian leader.\nAfter Vance challenged the Ukrainian president over problems he's had with the military and conscription, Zelensky replied: \"During the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have a nice ocean and don't feel [it] now, but you will feel it in the future.\"\nThat comment rankled Trump and drew him into the clash that up until this point had been limited to Zelensky and the vice-president.\nHere was the Ukrainian leader suggesting Trump had failed to grasp the moral hazard of dealing with the war's aggressor.\nZelensky's message cut to the heart of what critics say is Trump's fundamental miscalculation in dealing with Russia. That by ending Moscow's isolation and seeking a quick ceasefire he risks emboldening Putin, weakening Europe and leaving Ukraine open to being devoured.\nTrump tends to characterise the war as a kind of binary conflict between two sides who should both take their share of burden or blame for the fighting and its causes.\nBut Zelensky was trying to warn of catastrophic consequences of this thinking. This was the Ukrainian leader directly telling Trump in the Oval Office: Appease Russia, and the war will come to you.\nIt triggered Trump's biggest backlash. \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel. You're in no position to dictate that,\" he said, his voice getting louder.\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" he told him. \"You're gambling with millions of lives.\"\nThis exchange may win Zelensky plaudits among those who wanted to see him to stand up to Trump; but this moment could also decide an era of war and peace in Europe.\nAt one point later in the conversation, Zelensky said: \"From the very beginning of the war, we have been alone and we are thankful.\"\nThis angered Trump, who has repeatedly framed the war as a drain on American taxpayers.\n\"You haven't been alone,\" he said. \"You haven't been alone. We gave you - through this stupid president - $350bn,\" Trump said, a reference to Biden.\nVance then asked whether Zelensky had thanked the US during the meeting and accused him of campaigning \"for the opposition\" - the Democrats - during the US election last year.\nThe comment was a reference to a visit Zelensky made to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania - Joe Biden's hometown - just weeks before Americans headed to the polls in the November election.\nRepublicans were outraged at the visit, accusing Zelensky of turning the tour into a partisan campaign event on Kamala Harris's behalf in a battleground state.\nHere was all the bitter division of America's own polarised internal politics pouring into the room at a critical moment for future of global security.\n\"Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war,\" Zelensky began saying, only for Trump to cut him off.\n\"He's not speaking loudly,\" Trump shot back, visibly irritated. \"Your country's in big trouble.\"\n\"You're not winning, you're not winning this,\" Trump said. \"You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.\"\n\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" said Trump. \"It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change.\"\nThe president and vice-president reprimanded Zelensky, appearing most angered by what they perceived as his \"attitude\". \n\"Just say thank you,\" Vance demanded at one point.\nZelensky's responses - which were to fact check the two far more powerful men and argue his corner - seemed driven by the existential nature of this moment. \nHe has spent three years defending his country from invasion, while also trying to hold together a society and its political leadership that Putin has tried to drive apart. \nBut out of the main camera shot was another sight in the room. Zelensky's  ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, who was spotted with her head in her hands as the arguments escalated. \nIt is an image that sums up the diplomatic position for Zelensky and his relationship with - until now at least - his superpower sponsor in trying to repel Russia. \nStanding up to Trump like he did on Friday could, ultimately, mean losing to Putin.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass. \nWhen asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.\" \nHowever, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.\nIn public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops. \n\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.\nAccording to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.\nPresident Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests. \nHe suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?\nThe short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.\nBritain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending. \nBut Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.\nInstead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.  \nThat force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.\n\nBut these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".\nOfficials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nIt could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.\nWhile Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.\nEuropean nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics. \nNato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough. \nBut the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.\nEurope's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.\nFrance is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same.

Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.\nSir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.  But as for Donald Trump's question - would  Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no. \n",

but it has also brought scalpers and frauds to the hobby.\nCEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, who has been in charge of the company since 1998, spoke to BBC News ahead of its yearly update about the secret of its success, tackling challenges, and the series' future.\nPok\u00e9mon Day is an annual livestream showcasing upcoming releases, upgrades and events.\nFans got an extended look at upcoming Nintendo Switch title Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A, and learned it would be released later this year.\nThere was also a first glimpse of Pok\u00e9mon Champions - an upcoming mobile game that appeared to be inspired by the Stadium series focused on battles.\nAnd the company also showed off additions to the digital and physical versions of its trading card game.\nMr Ishihara wasn't giving away too much ahead of the event but says the company's long-term goal is to \"enrich both the real world and the virtual world\".\nPok\u00e9mon GO - the company's successful mobile phone app that works with a device's GPS to place monsters in the real world - is an example of this.\n\"This is what I think is the biggest strength of Pok\u00e9mon, and it's important for us to come up with this kind of idea,\" he says. \n\"So that's how I think of what we want to achieve next.\"\nOne of the hottest topics among long-term Pok\u00e9mon fans today is scalpers.\nThe resurgence of the collectible card game has caught the attention of resellers who buy up new packs in the hope of landing rare, valuable cards.\nYouTuber Logan Paul switched a lot of people on to the potential profits of the hobby when he paid $5.3m (\u00a33.9m) for the most expensive Pok\u00e9mon card ever.\nGaming companies have long had an issue with the second-hand market, and Mr Ishihara says it \"prevents new products from being sold\".\n\"When the second hand market becomes more valuable because of rarity, that is problematic because our business is affected.\"\nFans have suggested The Pok\u00e9mon Company could produce a greater volume of hard-to-find or limited-run items but Mr Ishihara says it cannot do much to control the resale market.\n\"Those items are seen to be valuable because they're rare or seen as vintage \u2013 and it's not our place to say that they're not,\" he says.\nOn the topic of counterfeit products Mr Ishihara is more direct, and says the company's legal teams have fought \"rigorously\" against clones and fakes since the beginning. \nIt recently won a long legal battle against the Chinese company behind a copycat mobile app.\nAnd earlier this year it joined Nintendo to sue the makers of Palworld - an online multiplayer survival game described as \"Pok\u00e9mon with guns\".\nIt alleges developer Pocketpair infringed patents, which it has denied.\nPok\u00e9mon has continued to bring new fans to the franchise by expanding into anime, card games, movies and toys alongside its video game titles.\nMr Ishihara says fans now \"span several generations\" and believes \"the biggest reason behind their success is the fact that Pok\u00e9mon became a tool of communication\".\nLast weekend, about 13,000 Pok\u00e9mon fans headed to the European leg of the International Championships at London's Excel Centre.\nIt demonstrates Mr Ishihara's point that people have found their way into the series through various means.\nFans Justin, 25, and Marina, 28, who turned up to the event in Team Rocket costumes, tell BBC News they got into Pok\u00e9mon by watching the animated TV show as children.\n\"I just loved all the designs, all the different characters,\" says Justin.\n\"They were just really really cute.\"\nMarina says in-person events have become a chance for her to meet fellow fans.\n\"I always used to want to go to conventions and these sorts of events.\n\"So being able to be here and network and make friends has been such a blessing,\" she says.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company is unusual because it is a private company.\nOther well-known Japanese brands, such as Nintendo and Hello Kitty maker Sanrio, are publicly traded and answerable to shareholders.\nMr Ishihara believes this allows his company to keep a single-minded focus on one thing.\n \"Pok\u00e9mon is the only thing we do at the Pok\u00e9mon Company,\" he says.\n\"So whatever profit we make from Pok\u00e9mon gets reinvested in Pok\u00e9mon.\"\nHe adds that this means the company doesn't have to field questions about expanding or creating new characters from shareholders.\n\"Our answer will be: 'We'll go bust when Pok\u00e9mon is no longer popular'.\n\"I don't think they will like that.\"\nAt the end of 2023, longtime hero Ash Ketchum and his best pal Pikachu bowed out of the animated Pok\u00e9mon series.\nThe series has continued without the well-loved duo, but one of the \"hardest questions\" Mr Ishihara gets asked is what they're up to now.\n\"Even though the TV camera may not be following them, Ash's journey is continuing and his partner Pikachu is right next to him.\"\nWith the franchise set to mark its 30th anniversary next year, rumours are already beginning to swirl about special plans for the occasion.\nRemakes or re-releases of the original Game Boy games are high on many fans' wishlists.\nMr Ishihara doesn't have much to say on that at the moment, but wants to maintain a focus on \"connecting the real and virtual worlds\". \n\"If we continue focusing on our mission, Pok\u00e9mon can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary,\" he says. \n\"But if we become complacent and go with the flow, that's when Pok\u00e9mon will go downhill.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. \nMs McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \n\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. \nThe impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.\nBut analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.\nChina has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.  \nTrump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.\nHis sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.\nA tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. \nIf you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.\nOne of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. \nDuring what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nThe exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nIt escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be \"thankful\" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" \nThe Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.\nIn a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" \n\"He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" Trump said.\nAhead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. \nZelensky had said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. \nNotably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nBut Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.\nTrump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. \nA big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \nOn the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for \"a significant reduction\" in their staff by 13 March.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.\nTrump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter the meeting, Macron said Trump had \"good reason\" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. \nTrump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nPart way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nTrump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.\nThe clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the \"riviera\" of the Middle East.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (\u00a3792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. \nOfficials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.\nTrump unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (\u00a33.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\nThe president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to \"high-level people\".\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. \nIt includes $4.5 trillion (\u00a33.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.\nHowever, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.\nTrump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.\n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.",

        "article_text": "Barry Ferguson suffered defeat in his home debut as Rangers head coach\n\"It's not good enough.\" \nNot the words Rangers interim head coach Barry Ferguson might have expected to be saying in the aftermath of his return to Ibrox, this time in charge, after the departure of Philippe Clement.\nOff the back of a rousing 4-2 fightback win at Kilmarnock in his first outing, this was set up to be a positive homecoming, during which captain James Tavernier made his 500th appearance for the club.\nYou could feel that pre-match. Like a weight had been lifted. Yet it went horribly wrong - again. \nMotherwell win to ruin Ferguson's Ibrox return\nCeltic thump five past St Mirren to extend Premiership lead\nRangers stumbled to a third straight defeat at Ibrox. Queens Park, St Mirren and now Motherwell, by 2-1, all victorious. Unthinkable and certainly unpalatable for the Rangers support as they, once again, demonstrated at full-time. \nAt least the minority that remained at Ibrox come that point. Certainly \"not good enough\".\nRangers are now 16 points behind Celtic with nine games remaining. They have either lost or drawn almost 38% of their league fixtures. \nFerguson looked increasingly agonised by a tepid, lacklustre display during which Motherwell took full advantage to earn a fantastic win, just their second in 61 league meetings between these sides.\nIt would be incredibly harsh to lay blame at Ferguson's feet, but the short-lived honeymoon seems over already. \nThe former Rangers captain has some serious issues to address - and quickly - as this squad looks increasingly unreliable, domestically at least.\n\"There's obviously a clear problem in terms of playing at home and that's something me as a manager and my staff and the players need to sit down and really get to the bottom of,\" Ferguson said.\nWorryingly for him, Ibrox was the one source of solace for much of this season as domestic away form deserted Rangers under Clement until late in his tenure. That home comfort has now imploded. \nSo what is the issue? \n\"There's good players here, I've seen it,\" Ferguson continued. \"Technically, very good. To play at Rangers, they need to be mentally strong. The fans demand that of you.\"\nOn this evidence, the mentality has been shredded. Experienced goalkeeper Jack Butland was culpable for the opener with a poor reaction save to allow Luke Armstrong to net the opener. His confidence looks diminished, as it does in many of his team-mates.\nThey were brutally exposed by some fine play from Motherwell for the second. \nMore concerning for Ferguson was the lack of energy throughout. It rarely felt that Rangers would go on and mount a winning comeback. \nThey cannot possibly win silverware, other than in Europe, where they face a stiff last 16 first-leg test away to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbache on Thursday. \nWill the Europa League version of this Jekyll and Hyde Rangers turn up again?\n\"Well, that's what happens when you play at Rangers,\" Ferguson explained.\n\"European football's great. It's great to be involved in. It's great financially for the club, but your bread and butter is domestic trophies. \n\"Domestically, the form has to be better. Europe's always been a bonus. It's brilliant to go and pit your wits against really good teams and really good managers and really good players, but what matters?

        "article_text": "England's men have won only one of their past 11 matches across three formats\nAnd so English cricket limps to its final stop of the winter.\nKarachi, where England will exit the Champions Trophy after Saturday's game against South Africa, is known as the City of Lights. Their last visit, the completion of a 3-0 Test series win in Pakistan in 2022, was Bazball's brightest moment. Now Brendon McCullum and his men cannot shake the dark clouds.\nAdele could write an album about how miserable England's 2025 has been so far. \nThe end of 2024 wasn't much better. The women dropped themselves out of the T20 World Cup and the men were spun out in Pakistan. Heather Knight's side at least won in South Africa and Ben Stokes' men claimed an impressive win in New Zealand, then soured it with a stag-do of a performance in the final Test in Hamilton.\nSince the turn of the year it has been a shambles: the women thrashed all over Australia, the men one win from 10 in McCullum's new white-ball era. Andrew Flintoff's Lions were hammered in South Africa and Australia, and the Under-19 women were well beaten in a World Cup semi-final by India. Thank goodness Archie Vaughan's Under-19 men won their Test series against South Africa.\nIt's probably good to get a few things straight before delving into this: all of us - fans, media and pundits - want England to do well. We care. It hurts when they lose.\nIt is also fair to say I have never met an England player that is not desperate to succeed. They may occasionally forget the England team exists for everyone, not just the individuals in the dressing room, but there is an understandable element of self-preservation at play. Dreams and careers are on the line. Professional sport is cut-throat.\nWe must also be careful to not rewrite history. McCullum was a breath of fresh air to English cricket, both in terms of results and the feeling towards the men's national team. It seemed a no-brainer to put him in charge of the white-ball side, largely because any other coach would have existed in the New Zealander's shadow.\nJon Lewis did similar with the women's team, even if Bazball-lite seemed too simplistic. The draw with Australia in the home Ashes of 2023 was creditable, and probably should have been better given Australia had lost Meg Lanning.\n'McCullum's problems go far beyond Buttler's future'\nEngland need more variety than just 90mph bowlers - Vaughan\nReplacing Buttler the sensible thing to do - Agnew\nAs 2024 wore into 2025 and results became indifferent for both teams, nagging doubts became worries and have now grown into genuine concerns.\nWill Ben Stokes be fully fit again? What has happened to Issy Wong? Why was Josh Hull picked? How did Flintoff go from TV presenter to some of the most high-profile coaching gigs in the country? Why did Dan Lawrence open the batting? Why did Kate Cross captain England in Ireland when it was a golden development opportunity for a youngster? Who signed off on one frontline spinner for a Champions Trophy in Pakistan? What is going on with Shoaib Bashir's bowling? Why do England women drop so many catches? We could go on and on.\nThere are recurring themes across the England national teams. The women have been accused of not being fit enough, the men of not training enough. Both charges are probably unfair, yet the players don't help their public image. \nWe're bored with hearing the men talk about golf and the women were downright daft to be pictured on a boat party during the T20 World Cup in Dubai. These England teams are not lazy, though they can be slapdash.\nThe rhetoric is maddening, too. Many legendary leaders have successfully paired public praise with private criticism, and listening to McCullum in particular can inspire even a jobbing journalist to take on the world. But some of the utterances of the men wind up fans and opposition, while the women were borderline delusional in Australia. Lewis' Bondi to Coogee walk will live in infamy, and the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook are never far from a crass soundbite.\nNone of this matters if England teams are winning. They aren't, which means Rob Key and Clare Connor - directors of cricket of the men's and women's team respectively - have thinking to do.\nIt seems a decent bet that Connor will be looking for a new women's head coach. A review into the Ashes is still taking place and could run until the end of next month. It may be that Knight stays on as captain, partly because she remains an excellent leader and partly because England's succession planning has been awful. Whoever is in charge must get the best out of Sophie Ecclestone on and off the pitch, while a bigger question is whether England have the right structural set-up to consistently compete with the Australians.\nKey's decisions on personnel are probably more straightforward. Jos Buttler sounded like a man ready to make up his own mind on the white-ball captaincy, with Brook most likely to take over. Where it gets trickier for Key, McCullum and the new skipper is reviving the fortunes of the white-ball team in a defining year for the Test side.\nThis video can not be played\nAfghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy\nOn one hand, it is harsh to compare the current white-ball team to the class of 2019, England's greatest team led by their greatest captain Eoin Morgan.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that a white-ball empire has crumbled on Key's watch. It is not his fault domestic 50-over cricket has been marginalised, but the treatment of David Willey, dropping of Sam Curran and Reece Topley, overlooking of Liam Dawson, obsession with pace over skill, lack of death bowlers and left-handed batters all fall at his door. How did England take the field in the Champions Trophy with as many wicketkeepers as frontline bowlers?\nWhereas there was once separation between the Test and white-ball set-ups, greater alignment runs the risk of a malaise from one format bleeding into the other. There is at least a decent break before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.\nUntil then, questions abound. Have England broken Mark Wood in a tournament he probably shouldn't have been playing in? What state is Stokes' hamstring in? Can Bashir become the spinner England need in Australia? Can Zak Crawley reach double figures? Is Test vice-captain Ollie Pope going to be dropped to make way for Jacob Bethell?\nNone of this gloom needs to be terminal. The women's game is about to get a huge boost from the new domestic structure and the men have every chance of winning their five-Test series against India. There is a wealth of young male and female talent coming through and the Ashes next winter has all the ingredients to be a classic.\nFor now, this winter cannot end quickly enough. Last rites and alarm bells will not be drowned out by good vibes.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Instead, Zelensky was told to leave early before it could be signed.\nTrump later told reporters that Ukraine's president \"overplayed his hand\" in the exchange and that he would need \"to say 'I want to make peace'\" to restart talks with the US.\nEuropean leaders rallied behind Zelensky, but Nato's secretary general said he must \"find a way\" to restore his relationship with Trump.\nOn Saturday, Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to sign the minerals agreement as \"the first step toward security guarantees\"  from the US - a line he has maintained for days, but which Trump has refused to agree to.\n\"But it's not enough, and we need more than just that,\" he added. \"A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine.\"\nHe added: \"All Ukrainians want to hear a strong US position on our side. It's understandable the US might look for dialogue with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. \n\"But the US has always spoken about 'peace through strength.' And together we can take strong steps against Putin.\"\nIn Russia, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman called Zelensky's visit to Washington a \"complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv\".\nMaria Zakharova said the Ukrainian president is \"obsessed\" with prolonging the war, and repeated Russia's insistence to annex all territories currently occupied by Russia. \n\nAhead of the London summit, where European leaders will further discuss efforts to secure a peace deal, Zelensky met UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who said he retained \"unwavering support for Ukraine\".\nSpeaking inside his office, Sir Keir told Zelensky he was \"very, very welcome here in Downing Street\" and reiterated that the UK would stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it may take\".\nHe added: \"A lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine - so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom.\"\nSenior political figures from across Europe have also rallied behind Ukraine after Friday's extraordinary scenes in the US.\nThe leaders of Germany, France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were among those who posted social media messages backing Ukraine - with Zelensky responding directly to each one to thank them for their support.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron posted: \"There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\"\nGermany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no-one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\".\nSpeaking to the BBC on Saturday, Nato chief Mark Rutte said he had spoken to Zelensky twice following the White House meeting, and told him \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.\nHe referenced the first Trump administration's approval for the sale of Javelin anti-tank missile systems allowed Ukraine to \"fight back\". \nPutin launched the war two years after Trump had left office.\nRussia has been making slow gains on the battlefield for months.\nIn the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, officials said that 12 people, including two children, were injured in a \"massive\" overnight drone strike, a short while after Zelensky left the White House.\nThe casualties included four female patients at a hospital in the city centre. Residential buildings, pharmacies, cafes and shops were also been damaged, the Ukrainian prosecution service said. \nFriday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\nZelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous ceasefire deal in 2019, agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.",

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases.\n*Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US).\n** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "article_text": "\"I grew up round here thinking I could not wait to get out,\" says 51-year-old Dan Davies.\n\"And then I used to come back up from London on a weekly basis and would see half the place boarded up and going downhill fast.\"\nNew Brighton, on the northern tip of the Wirral peninsula in Merseyside, was once a booming holiday destination boasting the longest promenade in the country, a pier and a tower bigger than Blackpool's.\nBut in the mid-1980s, after cheap package deals to Spain had become the first choice for many holidaymakers, New Brighton found itself struggling to keep up, and photographer Martin Parr's famous 1986 collection The Last Resort depicted it as a scruffy, litter-strewn town whose glory days were behind it.\nNow, though, it is undergoing a huge renaissance: in 2020 house prices rose faster in New Brighton than anywhere else in the country, investment is returning and businesses are thriving.\nSo how does a place go from being somewhere people cannot wait to leave to somewhere people cannot move to fast enough?\nFran Barrett, 35, returned to New Brighton after going away to London to study and work as a journalist.\n\"When you're a kid you never want to live where you're growing up,\" she said. \n\"But I realised as I got older why it was such a great place to live.\"\nWhile many of Fran's friends who stayed in London were still trying to get on the property ladder, she and her husband and toddler son were able to move up a rung in 2021 because of the \u00a330,000 they made in profit on their terraced home.\n\"It just has a real community feel to it,\" said Fran. \n\"There are so many new businesses springing up, and if you've got kids there are so many great little parks. \n\"A lot of my friends from other parts of the Wirral are moving here, too.\"\nAnd they all need places to eat, drink and shop. \nFran's sister Lou runs the caf\u00e9 bar and gift shop SUP, just one of many independent businesses that have sprung up in the town in recent years.\nA few hundred yards away from SUP is the James Atherton pub, which takes its name from the resort's founder who, in the 1830s, set about creating a northern version of Sussex seaside town Brighton.\nThe pub made national headlines in 2020 when it was renamed in a disparaging tribute to Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings and their three-tier coronavirus lockdown restrictions.\nIt is one of a number of buildings in Victoria Road that Dan's company Rockpoint Leisure revived.\nTo \"keep out the big boys\", as he puts it, the company bought up parcels of land and buildings and made sure independent shops, cafes and art spaces were able to move in. \nThe walls of many of them are now festooned with large murals by artists both local and global.\n\"We wanted to demonstrate that you don't need big outside consultants to come in and tell you what you need, you need a sustainable plan that can protect a place like New Brighton.\n\"We did that, and we have become the number one model for seaside town regeneration,\" he says.\nVictoria Road is a haven of independent businesses. \nThe Hatch art gallery opened in an old greengrocer's shop and took its name from the hatch through which people were served during the pandemic.\n\"Seaside towns are absolutely having a renaissance,\" says owner Anneley Pickles, 51. \n\"They just need things that will bring people here, whether that's food or entertainment, or workshops or arts spaces.\"\nJust up the road is Tallulah's Emporium, which owner Wayne Saunders describes as a \"listening space\" after the model of the Japanese kissa bars that specialise in playing jazz records.\nWayne, 51, left New Brighton in 1989, at a time when \"numerous friends from primary school had ended up dead or in prison\".\nHe moved to London, where he opened the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Shoreditch, before returning to New Brighton to open up Tallulah's in 2022.\nHe agrees with Dan's assessment that New Brighton is, with its thriving independent scene, \"Wirral's Brooklyn to Liverpool's Manhattan\".\nThere are not many remnants of New Brighton's past as a Victorian and Edwardian seaside town still visible today. \nThe tower was pulled down and sold for scrap in the 1920s, while the ballroom was gutted by fire in 1969 and then demolished.\nBut the town has always remained a seaside resort. \nIn 2011, the Marine Point development opened at an estimated cost of about \u00a365m, bringing a cinema, hotel, bars and restaurants to the seafront. \nIt stands a short distance from the Fort Perch Rock coastal defence battery \u2013 now a museum \u2013 which was built in the 1820s to protect Liverpool from foreign naval attack, and the Adventureland amusement complex which was built about 100 years later and which has been mooted for redevelopment as apartments in recent years.\nJayne Casey, a former member of punk band Big In Japan, now runs a small deli and arts bar District House just around the corner in Victoria Road.\nNow 68, she remembers the New Brighton of the 1980s that was encapsulated in Parr's Last Resort collection, and believes that, generally, the photos captured the area quite well.\n\"It was where people from Liverpool and the Wirral came for a cheap day out,\" she says.\n\"It had a beautiful 1930s outdoor swimming pool, and had that classic seaside town look to it.\n\"It was a place that working-class people came en-masse in the time when the factories closed down for a week and everyone had a week at the seaside.\"\nToday the resort is still popular with day trippers and families. \nAnd according to one person who was involved in its regeneration over the last decade, attempts to broaden what the town had to offer were not always met with open arms.\n\"There was a feeling from some that New Brighton is just about grandparents bringing their grandkids for day out,\" they said. \n\"But there were those who felt it was about more than just Fort Perch Rock and the promenade.\"\nJane, who helped transform a wilderness of empty warehouses near the Liverpool waterfront into the arts and tech enclave now known as the Baltic Triangle, says that while art and culture are playing a big part in New Brighton's renaissance and transformation, the town is not being \"gentrified\".\nGentrification is the process through which working-class urban populations find themselves displaced and priced out of their own communities.\n\"Yes, house prices have gone up and new people have come in but I don't think any kind of mass gentrification has happened,\" she says. \n\"But,\" she warns, \"there are some big sites that could come up and then could become apartment blocks and flats.\"\nNew Brighton's promenade \u2013 the longest in Britain \u2013 will be most familiar to those outside the north-west of England as the location of a Channel 4 ident that includes the TV network's logo running to keep pace with a group of wheelchair racers.\nNext month, the documentary I Am Martin Parr will be screened at The Light cinema, part of the Marine Point complex which looms over the promenade where that clip was filmed and where one of Parr's most infamous shots was taken.\nJose Wilmin, who has been coming to New Brighton for more than 60 years from her home in Ellesmere Port, has witnessed the resort going through its ups and downs in that time.\n\"It used to be a proper holiday place, there was a massive outdoor pool, a big funfair and the main street was just packed with bucket-and-spade shops,\" the 68-year-old says.\nWhile she says it is great to see New Brighton \"on the up again\", she has been a regular through good times and bad.\n\"I've always come here, to have fish and chips and watch the world go by.\n\"It's

Buttler made 21 in his final outing as skipper.\nThat effectively sealed England's seventh consecutive one-day international defeat by the halfway stage and South Africa took just 29.1 overs to complete their chase.\nJofra Archer took two early wickets but Rassie van der Dussen hit an unbeaten 72 and Heinrich Klaasen 64 from 56 balls as the pursuit became a procession.\nThe Proteas progress as group winners to the semi-finals, where they will play the loser of Sunday's match between India and New Zealand.\nEngland immediately head home after a torrid start to 2025.

The former chipped a return catch to Marco Jansen, who dismissed the top three in taking 3-39, via a leading edge, while Root was bowled by seamer Wiaan Mulder.\nIn between, Harry Brook, many people's favourite to take over from Buttler, offered too much air in attempting to clear mid-wicket and was brilliantly caught by the sprawling Jansen on the boundary.\nSouth Africa's fielding was superb \u2013 Lungi Ngidi athletically catching Jamie Overton while running back from mid-on \u2013 but a frazzled England were inept in their decision-making.\nThe worst dismissal was that of Liam Livingstone, who charged spinner Keshav Maharaj, attempted a hack to leg, missed and was stumped for nine.\nButtler's final innings as captain ended in tame fashion as he looped Ngidi to mid-off.

        "article_text": "French photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 captured this dystopian scene as the world headed towards lockdown in February 2020.\nOn Saturday 25 January 2020, millions of Chinese people started celebrating the Lunar New Year. The country's megacities saw huge temporary migrations as people left to celebrate with friends and family in distant towns and cities, as they did every January.\nThat year, however, there was a dramatic difference. Many of the people who left to celebrate were unable to return for weeks or even months. A type of pneumonia that had appeared in the western Chinese city of Wuhan the previous December had quietly became a concern. By the time Chinese revellers boarded trains and planes home a month later it had become a crisis.\nFrench photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 was in Beijing at that very moment, as the seriousness of the Wuhan virus became more evident. \"The photo editor at the New York Times had asked me to roam Beijing and take some pictures of the atmosphere. I just gotten back from holidays and I didn't know what to expect.\"\nWuhan was already in lockdown, though these measures hadn't yet been adopted by other Chinese cities. Even so, Sabri\u00e9 found the city sombre and eerily quiet. \"There were very, very few people anywhere. Most restaurants were closed. Everybody was worried that the disease would spread to Beijing.\n\"What made the situation probably more anxious is people didn't have much trust in what the authorities were saying. Initially, they had said there was no human-to-human transmission, then, just a few days later, they reverse and then go into full lockdown for Wuhan, a city of 10 million.\"\nSabri\u00e9 says the Chinese authorities had stressed that there had been few deaths in Beijing, a city of 23 million people. \"The question is, could we trust those figures? That was a big thing,\" Sabri\u00e9 says. Beijing's citizens began to shy away from the routines of city life, encouraged by public health messages to limit the spread. \"It was not a firm lockdown, like you had to stay home, but basically, you were encouraged to limit your movements,\" Sabri\u00e9 says.\nThe result was an eerie emptiness in a city usually bustling with life. The subways were empty; those who hadn't left for the provinces were staying home. The stillness was dramatic, but lacked a human reference point. \"It was quite paradoxical, because when you need to shoot something empty, actually you need people. If it's fully empty, it's not as strong.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Covid-19: The heat-showing shape of things to come\n\u2022\u00a0Is Covid becoming less deadly?\n\u2022\u00a0Why Covid-19 isn't yet seasonal\nSabri\u00e9 had an idea. Near Beijing is a resort area called Lake Houhai, a locale with many traditional houses and usually packed with sightseers day and night. When he turned up, \"it was around dinner time\", Sabri\u00e9 says, when the area would usually be crowded with people. \"This place is a must-see for any tourist, Chinese or foreign, who comes and visits Beijing. It's full of bars [and] tourist shops. Those bars usually play very loud music\u2026 each bar is louder than the next one, trying to attract more people.\"\nInstead, the bars were silent and the streets empty. Then Sabri\u00e9 spotted just one bar that wasn\u2019t completely void of life. Behind the pane of a large window, sat a lone man, softly illuminated by an overhead light. \"He was there by himself in the middle of this place which should have been bustling with life and music and sound and people,\" says Sabri\u00e9. But there was this man \"having his dinner from plastic dishes, his only companion a cat unaware of what was going on, of the tension and the anxiety\".\nThe photo is a scene in which more appears the longer you look at it. The man sits amid the normal detritus of a makeshift meal, his face gently lit by the glow of his phone. Around him lies the plush bar seating, a red pillar, the lights of bar in the background. At the bottom of the frame, a cat crouches on the back of a sofa. It could have been snapped in the small hours, once all the revellers have headed home. But instead, it's a marker: the end of normal life as a megacity hunkers down.\n\"I didn't get into the bar,\" Sabri\u00e9 explains. \"I just put my camera against [the] window. I don't think he ever noticed me, and I took the picture and moved on.\"\u00a0\nSabri\u00e9 says he thought little of the image after he took it, but the picture clearly resonated with the New York Times picture desk: the image was used as part of their The Great Empty special, published the following month. Sabri\u00e9 notes that the figure is unmasked \u2013 something that was becoming rare to see on the streets as the pandemic ramped up.\nSabri\u00e9's appreciation for the image has grown with the distance of five years. \"You have the darkness that reflects the darkness of the time, and the anxiety that we were feeling,\" he says. \"If you look closely at the picture, the [man] is looking at his phone.\"\nThis, Sabri\u00e9 adds, depicts another kind of darkness \"in terms of information and knowledge\" as people scoured the internet for information, in a desperate effort to understand what was happening to the world.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant.\u00a0Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare.\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right \u2013 she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\u00a0\nThe playwright\u00a0never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\u00a0\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\u00a0\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady\n\u2022\u00a0The historic female gang who menaced London\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her\u00a02011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s\u00a0that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\u00a0\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest.\u00a0\"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\u00a0\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" \u2013 one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\u00a0\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise L\u00fcbeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot \u2013 a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

It's absolutely amazing,\" Hannah said. \nBass player Emer McLaughlin was equally thrilled at the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\"I'm so incredibly excited and honoured to be supporting giants Snow Patrol in the SSE Arena.\n\"This has been a literal dream come true for us as an upcoming band in so many ways.\n\"It's such a landmark venue - it's our first ever arena show - and to be supporting a fellow Irish band like Snow Patrol just makes it such an unbelievable experience.\"\nThe members of CHERYM say that when it comes to the music industry they, like many other young bands, need as much exposure as possible in order to progress in a very competitive industry. \n\"This is probably the biggest level of exposure we've ever had,\" says Alannagh.\nAlthough CHERYM are signed to a small independent record label called Alcopop Records, who they say are so artist-friendly, Alannagh says it is \"extremely difficult\" to make a name for yourself.\n\"I saw an article by Sam Fender where he was speaking about the music industry very recently and how ninety per cent of it are people who come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds.\n\"Whereas for a working-class band it is very, very difficult to do that.\"\nAlannagh explained that CHERYM's members rely on funding and other support \"to actually be able to pay our petrol money on the way home and to be able to make a living out of this\".\n\"Some of us have full time jobs in order to make this work,\" she said.\n\"So we have to have a second job in order to pursue our actual passion.\"\nThe band are delighted that Lightbody likes their music and described the support from Snow Patrol's members as \"very reassuring\".\nCHERYM have also toured with The Undertones and say it was an experience they will never forget as the popular Derry band took them under their wing.\nThey even got to perform the famous anthem Teenage Kicks live on stage with them.\n\"It was so fun.

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases.\n*Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US).\n** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.\nJapan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.\nMonster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.\n\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.\n\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"\nOther Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.\nRyu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020. \nThe company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time. \nThis can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.\nThe Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way. \nMore recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.\nAt last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.\nMr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".\nThat includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.\n\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.\nJapan does face some of the same challenges as other developers worldwide.\nPlayer habits are changing, with PC gaming increasing in popularity, and as technology becomes more advanced making games becomes more expensive.\nMr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\". \n\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"\nThe games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.\nIt leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.\nMr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.\n\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.\n\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"\nFor an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.\n\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.\n\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

        "article_text": "Plymouth have already shocked Brentford and Liverpool in the FA Cup this season, but can they upset another Premier League team, Manchester City, in round five?\n\"Argyle have gone really direct under new manager Miron Muslic,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"It's a great clash of styles with the possession football that Pep Guardiola plays, but the problem if you keep going long against City is that you keep giving them the ball back.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all eight fifth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against comedian and Plymouth fan Josh Widdicombe.\nWiddicombe is touring the UK with his 'Not My Cup Of Tea' stand-up show in 2025 and 2026, which culminates with two nights at the Hackney Empire in London.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nWiddicombe co-hosts the Parenting Hell podcast with Rob Beckett and recently triumphed on BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special\nJosh missed Plymouth's famous win over Liverpool in round four because he was at a Strictly Come Dancing Live Show with his daughter, so will he be at Etihad Stadium this weekend?\n\"No, I will be in Chipping Norton, doing a preview show for my tour,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"My on-stage time will be 7.30pm which would be when injury time starts. That's life!\n\"I was actually disappointed we got City because when you get into the fifth round of the FA Cup, you start thinking that, if we get an easy draw, we are in the quarter-finals. \n\"So, City were the worst possible draw, really. The fact the FA Cup is the only thing they can win doesn't help much either. If they were playing in the Champions League next week we would be in a slightly better position.\n\"Still, the longer we go without conceding, the more I will dare to dream. I would obviously take penalties now, in a heartbeat, even though I would be on stage.\n\"Although, by the time penalties happen, after all the injury time and extra time, it might be around 8.15pm, which is when my break usually is.\n\"That's what I am going to be wishing for, because I might just get to see a shootout - but honestly let's just hope the tie is still up for grabs when I go on stage.\"\nWiddicombe (right) poses with famous Bolton fan Vernon Kay before the 2023 Papa Johns Trophy final - the last time Plymouth reached Wembley. Sadly for Josh, the Pilgrims lost 4-0\nJosh co-hosted the cult podcast about 1990s football 'Quickly Kevin, Will He Score?' between 2017 and 2024 and feels that decade was full of classic FA Cup moments.\n\"There were lots of iconic finals in the 1990s,\" he added. \"I can instantly tell you the result and every goalscorer of every one, while I am struggling to tell you who won it last year.\n\"That's because of a combination of two things - firstly, in the same way you remember what was Christmas number one when you were a kid, everything is more vivid the first time around - it is more exciting and seems to matter more.\n\"Also, sadly, the FA Cup is not nearly as important as it was. You've even got some Plymouth fans saying they would rather stay up than win it this season - my response to that is 'are you clinically insane? Who cares if we stay up!'.\n\"In a few years you are not going to say 'oh thank God we are in the Championship. You are going to go 'can you remember when we won the FA Cup!?!' That's what you dream about.\n\"Those one-off events are the things you cling on to, and in a strange way I am glad that because I wasn't able to go to our win over Liverpool, I was at Strictly Live with my daughter instead.\n\"That makes it more of a memory for me. I will always remember where I was when it happened, and it wasn't just the case where I was at home watching on TV and then I had to go to the park.\"\nChris Sutton and Josh Widdicombe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nVilla Park, 20:00 GMT\n10th in Premier League v 19th in Championship\nGap = 29\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe rest of the season is going to be a bit of a juggling act for Aston Villa.\nThey are still in the Champions League and also trying to finish high enough in the Premier League to qualify for it again next season.\nSo, it will be interesting to see if they target the FA Cup too. I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.\nStill, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.\nLet's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.\nCardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.\nThey may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nJosh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. \nSo, there is quite a lot in this for them while, in contrast, if any of the Championship teams are going to be focused on the league it is Cardiff. 3-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup moment: It would probably be Wrexham beating Arsenal in 1992 with Mickey Thomas's free-kick for their equaliser. I don't like Wrexham now because they are the big dogs of the lower leagues but that was the iconic upset of my childhood.\nIt was probably the first big one that I saw for myself. When I was a kid, all the same FA Cup upsets used to get talked about all the time - like Hereford against Newcastle - but this was the first proper one I remember, after Arsenal had won the league and Wrexham had finished bottom.\nThis video can not be played\nFA Cup Archive: Wrexham upset Arsenal in 1992\nSelhurst Park, 12:15 GMT\n12th in Premier League v 12th in Championship\nGap = 8\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWill in-form Crystal Palace go for it in the FA Cup? I really hope so.\nOliver Glasner's side have improved as the season has gone on and they are comfortably in mid-table of the Premier League without any danger of going down. A cup run would really cap this as a successful campaign for him.\nIt would have an even bigger impact for Palace's fans. I still remember Ian Wright's goals in the 1990 final where they lost to Manchester United in a replay. They lost to United in the 2016 final too, and it would be great to give them a new memory.\nThis won't be easy, because former Norwich boss Alex Neil took charge of Millwall at the end of last year and is doing a good job.\nThey have been quite stubborn in recent weeks and I'm expecting more of the same here, but the Eagles should edge it in normal time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: We beat Millwall 5-1 off the back of of our win over Liverpool, which was a bit of a freak result. Normally you'd lose straight after that kind of game. \nLike Villa, Palace are another team who should be going for the FA Cup but Millwall have reached the final in my lifetime, even if it was fully 21 years ago. \nI'd gone for a replay at first, before I remembered there aren't any - the death of FA Cup replays is very sad, isn't it? 1-1 after extra time, then Millwall to win on penalties\nDeepdale, 12:15 GMT\n15th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\nGap = 12\nWatch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nThis will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.\nIt ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.\nMaybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?\nBurnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.\nPreston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.\nLet's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penalties\nJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support. \nBurnley in contrast are one of the six teams that are forever going to switch between the Premier League and the Championship. They are trying to win promotion this time by not conceding any goals whatsoever, which is different, but still not very exciting for their fans. \nThis is a local derby, but it is such a dry game. I'll go 1-0 to Burnley - no, 1-0 to Preston. 1-0\nVitality Stadium, 15:00 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 17th in Premier League\nGap = 10\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWolves won here in the Premier League on Saturday but only after Bournemouth had Illia Zabarnyi sent off in the first half. That completely skewed that result so I am not using it as a form guide for this tie.\nWhat will be more relevant is how many changes both teams make for this game. \nI was at Wolves' win over Blackburn in round four and their manager Vitor Pereira went kind of half-strong there. I can guarantee you he will be prioritising Premier League survival ahead of FA Cup progress, so we will probably see another mix-and-match selection from him here too.\nAs for Bournemouth, well I have already talked about why Crystal Palace should be trying to win the FA Cup this season, and the same definitely applies to Andoni Iraola's side.\nThe Cherries have only reached the quarter-finals twice before, losing at that stage in 1957 and 2021, and their best moments in the competition are probably as a lower-league giantkiller, such as when they beat Manchester United as a third-tier team in 1984.\nThis year they are genuine contenders to win it and lift the club's first major trophy, and they have already shown they can beat anyone, especially at home. \nThey are still seventh in the Premier League despite losing their past two matches, and I would be really disappointed - no, actually I'd be angry - if Iraola picks a weakened team in the situation they are in.\nHe has got a responsibility to the fans to try to reach the semi-finals for the first time. Yes they have got a chance of making the Champions League, which would be incredible, but they are only two wins away from their biggest day out ever at Wembley. Why not go for it?\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: Usually, the result never recurs when teams play each other twice in a short space of time, so I am backing Bournemouth. 2-0\nEtihad Stadium, 17:45 GMT\n4th in Premier League v 22nd in Championship\nGap = 38\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe FA Cup is Manchester City's only realistic chance of a trophy this season, so there is no chance they will lack focus here.\nCity come into this tie off the back of a good win at Tottenham on Wednesday, which I predicted. The readers went for a Spurs victory, which was just ridiculous - what on earth were you thinking?\nI am going for Pep Guardiola's side to win this comfortably, but fair play to Plymouth for getting this far.\nThey have knocked out Liverpool and won at Brentford but it is going to be third time unlucky for them against Premier League teams.\nWith what is at stake for them, City cannot let this one slip - and they won't.\nSutton's prediction: 5-0\nJosh's prediction: I think it is absurd when fans predict victories for their own team. They do it all the time, while I just go into every game thinking we are going to lose - that is my attitude to life, that surely this is going to go wrong.\nSo, I think we are going to lose every game 4-0, which actually feels like a worthwhile prediction here. Then you are always pleasantly surprised - well, maybe not always, but most of the time - when you don't. \nWe have played very, kind of, pretty football for the past five years but under our new manager, our playing style is, shall we say, a little more industrial these days.\nIt's much worse when you are at home trying to break down a team in the Championship but it is perfect for this scenario, away at Manchester City. We are practising the right type of football to cause an FA Cup upset but the truth of it is that we are not going to win, so who cares!? 4-0\nJosh on who will win the FA Cup? I obviously want Plymouth to win it but I think City will do it. So, in a way, this is one of those games where people say 'this is the real final'. Whoever wins out of Plymouth and City will go on and win the FA Cup.\nSt James' Park, 13:45 GMT\n6th in Premier League v 8th in Premier League\nGap = 2\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nAlexander Isak missed Newcastle's defeat at Anfield with a groin injury so he has to be a doubt for this tie too, and his absence is a massive blow for Eddie Howe's side.\nBrighton have hit a bit of form since losing 7-0 to Nottingham Forest at the start of February, and have won four in a row in the Premier League and FA Cup.\nThe Seagulls also won at St James' Park earlier in the season, when Danny Welbeck got the winner. I remember that one because I got that prediction wrong.\nPeople are talking about Newcastle being distracted by their upcoming Carabao Cup final against Liverpool [on 16 March] but could they actually be in line for a domestic cup double this season?\nI am banking on them keeping that possibility alive here. They obviously could really do with having Isak back but, even if he is not fit, then surely Brighton can't win there twice this season... can they?\nSutton's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Newcastle are never going to win the FA Cup - they are always constantly about to win the FA Cup, and about to win their first trophy. I mean obviously they have got the Carabao Cup final coming up but, no, Newcastle will never win the FA Cup. Brighton are quite a 1980s team, aren't they, because of when they reached the Cup final in 1983? Let's see that again. 1-2\nOld Trafford, 16:30 GMT\n14th in Premier League v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nI am sick of backing Manchester United. Even though they beat Ipswich on Wednesday, they did not half make hard work of it and the Tractor Boys ran them close at Old Trafford.\nAlejandro Garnacho appeared to have a bit of a hissy fit after being hooked before half-time, so it will be interesting to see how Ruben Amorim deals with that. He won't have any players left at this rate if he decides to leave Garnacho out.\nUnited are the FA Cup holders and they have beaten Fulham home and away already this season but on both occasions it was far from convincing, and I don't really care about that anyway.\nAmorim is a likeable guy, and I've got sympathy for him about the size of his task at Old Trafford but, from watching United, I cannot think of any reason to back them to win this. \nI am usually wrong about Fulham, but they are going to take this one - 100%.\nSutton's prediction: 0-3\nJosh's prediction: I can see United getting to the cup final this year. They were quite jammy on their way to winning it last year - against Coventry in the semi-final for example - but were they actually jammy? It meant they kept Erik ten Hag for another six months which is probably the worst thing which could have happened to them. I don't know if that FA Cup win has made this season much worse. 2-0\nCity Ground, 19:30 GMT\n3rd in Premier League v 18th in Premier League\nGap = 15\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna made 11 changes when his side beat Coventry in round four and I suspect he will do something similar here.\nYou might have heard about 'Sutton's Super Computer', which were the calculations I did for the Monday Night Club this week, where I worked out the results of all the remaining Premier League fixtures.\nAccording to my secret formula, which is obviously extremely scientific, the Tractor Boys only have an outside chance of staying up. Along with Leicester they were in my 'no-hopers' category.\nMaybe Ipswich can surprise me and go on an FA Cup run, but you have to fancy Nottingham Forest here.\nDefeat would just leave a grim fight against relegation for McKenna's side, so I feel for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who regular readers will know follows the Tractor Boys, but not so much for my 5 Live colleague Ali Bruce-Ball who is a phony Ipswich supporter - when I asked him, he could not remember the last time he went to watch them as a fan.\nOne thing I really can't stand are people like Bruce who attach themselves to a club which has a bit of success, claiming some tenuous link from the past.\nMy boyhood team Forest may make changes too because they are still in a good position for a Champions League spot, but I am backing Chris Wood to come off the bench and get us a winner.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Forest are another throwback team who do not seem to have had a decent Cup run for a long time. 2-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup final of the 1990s: Spurs versus Forest in 1991 was a really important and seismic one, because of Gazza [Paul Gascoigne] and what it did to his career. \nThere were some other great ones too, though, like 1997 when Middlesbrough lost to Chelsea. That was quite fun because of Roberto di Matteo's goal after 47 seconds. \nThen there was 1995 when Manchester United lost to Everton after they had been going for the Double and lost everything, and even 1993 was interesting because Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday met in both domestic cup finals. I'm not going to, but you could write a book about the history of 90s football based around those finals, because they mattered so much then.\nChris has six correct results from the nine midweek Premier League games played so far in week 27, with one exact score, giving him 90 points.\nWith one game still to be played, he is level with his guest, singer Paige Cavell, who also has six correct results with one exact score.\nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, the BBC readers got three correct results with no exact scores, giving them 30 points.\nThey can no longer win this week, but the outcome of Thursday's game between West Ham and Leicester will decide whether Chris or Paige takes the victory.\nChris has gone for a 2-0 Hammers success while Paige has picked a 1-1 draw.",

They obviously could really do with having Isak back but, even if he is not fit, then surely Brighton can't win there twice this season... can they?Sutton's prediction: 3-2 after extra timeJosh's prediction: Newcastle are never going to win the FA Cup - they are always constantly about to win the FA Cup, and about to win their first trophy. You are going to go 'can you remember when we won the FA Cup!?!' I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.Still, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.Let's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.Cardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.They may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Josh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. This will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.It ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.Maybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?Burnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.Preston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.Let's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.Sutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penaltiesJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support.",

Almost all cases - 101 - were in patients 17 and younger.\nSpeaking at the first cabinet meeting of US President Donald Trump's current term on Wednesday, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr claimed that there had been two deaths. \nHowever, Katherine Wells, the director of the public health department in Lubbock, Texas, where the death occurred, clarified later that there has only been one.\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC clarifying the number of deaths. \nThe US declared that measles had been \"eliminated\" in 2000, but the country has seen outbreaks in recent years amid a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. The last US measles death was in 2015, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nThe current outbreak is centred in north-west Texas, with measles also recently found across the state's border in New Mexico, as well as Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New York City and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nCurrently, there are nine cases reported in New Mexico, four of whom are children.\nKennedy, a vaccine sceptic in the past, said that measles outbreaks were common and there have been four measles outbreaks so far in the US this year.

Kennedy said altogether 20 people were in hospital to quarantine.\nFive people in Texas who were infected had been vaccinated, the department also said. \nNew Mexico's congressional delegation pushed Kennedy to urgently address the current outbreak, urging him to \"launch a vaccination promotion campaign\" and rehire recently fired federal health workers, among other measures,  in a letter on Monday.\n\"Just last Friday, two dozen employees at the CDC charged with training public laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts were fired,\" the state's two senators and three House members, all Democrats, wrote. \n\"Those firings will worsen outbreaks and ultimately threaten the health of all Americans in the face of the next public health emergency.\" \nMeanwhile, areas affected by the outbreak are hosting free vaccination clinics, with the city of Lubbock, where the child victim died, holding hours-long clinics each day this week.\nThe Texas outbreak is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, and local media.\nMost US children receive two immunisation shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the CDC.\nVaccination rates in Texas are 94.3%, according to the CDC, which is below the 95% level that the Infectious Diseases Society of America says is needed to also protect those who are not immunized, commonly called \"herd immunity\".\n\"Measles was rare in the United States, but outbreaks are occurring in areas where vaccination rates have fallen,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement. \"Most children who get measles are not up to date on recommended vaccines or are not old enough to get measles vaccine.\"",

'Noise pollution'For six months, a traffic regulation order will allow coaches to leave Meadow Way after a 10-minute drop-off period, turn right onto Station Road, then right onto the Fosse Way before reaching the industrial estate.The Local Democracy Reporting Service reports that parking would be available to Pulhams Coaches at the industrial estate between 09:00 and 16:00 every day.Jubilee Lodge care home's manager said the \"noise pollution\" of coaches and their passengers would \"not only be disruptive to our residents but also those visiting loved ones\". \"LDRSThe county council's highways department has invited feedback from Bourton-on-the-Water residents during the periodJohn Wareing and Len Wilkins, Bourton-on-the-Water's two Cotswold district councillors, voted against, citing the lack of \"consideration\" for Jubilee Lodge residents, visitors, and employees, and schoolchildren and parents who use the \"already busy\" pavement.",

They were also ordered to pay NZ$4.8m in reparation to the victims. \nHowever, following an appeal, the High Court ruled on Friday that the company only owned the land and were not responsible for people's safety.\nWhite Island, which is also known by its M\u0101ori name, Whakaari, is New Zealand's most active volcano and has been erupting in some form since 2011.\nIt had been showing signs of heightened unrest for weeks before the fatal December 2019 eruption, which killed almost half of the people who were on it at the time. Most were tourists, including 17 from Australia and three from the US.\nAnother 25 people were injured, with many suffering extensive burns.\nHigh Court Justice Simon Moore said on Friday that while WML licensed tours of the volcano, there was nothing in these agreements that gave the company control of what was happening on the island day to day.\nHe agreed that it was reasonable for the company to rely on tour operators, as well as emergency management and science organisations, to assess risks to safety.\nJustice Moore added that, in coming to his decision, he had not ignored the pain and grief of the families that had been affected.\n\"It is impossible not to be deeply moved and affected by the sheer scale and nature of the human loss in this case,\" he said.\nThirteen parties in total, including tour operators, were charged over the disaster. WML was the last to receive a verdict after six had pleaded guilty, while six more had their charges dismissed.\nThe case against WML was the largest action of its kind brought by New Zealand's regulator, Worksafe NZ, who said it acknowledged the High Court ruling and was considering whether to appeal. \nJames Cairney, a lawyer for James, Andrew and Peter Buttle - three brothers who own the company - said the family welcomed the decision, Radio New Zealand reported. He added that the Buttles hoped it would \"bring certainty for all landowners who grant others recreational access to their land\". \nThe Buttle family has owned Whakaari/White Island since the 1930s, when their grandfather bought it and placed it in a family trust. It is one of only a few privately owned islands in New Zealand. \nThe brothers had previously been on trial in relation to the 2019 disaster as individuals over alleged breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety legislation.

        "article_text": "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.\nIt signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.\nEssentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.\nThere is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.\nSo a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.\nBut this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.\nIt is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.\nIt is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.\nIn addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.\nThe narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".\nPerhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.\nThis strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes. \nThe UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.\nWhile the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.\nThe White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.\nLikewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.\nThis appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.\nThe prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.\nCould the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?\nThere are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.\nAnd even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.\nThat is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.\nThe PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.\nThe strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one.",

Faisal Islam: Any Starmer deal with Trump is all about avoiding tariffs16 hours agoShareSaveFaisal IslamEconomics editor\u2022@faisalislamShareSaveGetty ImagesThe US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says TrumpKey takeaways from Starmer's talks with TrumpHow could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street.",

        "article_text": "From Disney's Snow White to Mickey 17, these are the films to stream at home and watch in the cinema this month.\nDisney's Snow White is a live-action/ CGI remake of Walt Disney's first ever feature-length cartoon, 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but it's proven to be more controversial than the studio's other remakes. Some bigoted social-media posters objected to the casting of Rachel Zegler, an actress with Colombian heritage, as Snow White; Zegler was hit by another backlash when she described the prince in the original cartoon as a \"stalker\"; Peter Dinklage said that the portrayal of the dwarves was \"backwards\"; and Stuart Heritage in the Guardian slated the trailer as \"arguably the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\", adding that \"the design of the new dwarves feels like something that would be deliberately shown to prisoners of war to break their spirit\". On the other hand, Disney's Snow White boasts new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (La La Land, The Greatest Showman) and a screenplay co-written by Greta Gerwig (Barbie), so its modern take on a classic fairy tale could still be a gold mine, or even a diamond mine.\nReleased in cinemas internationally on 21 March\nIf you like twisty satirical chillers set in the exclusive enclaves of super-rich eccentrics (Glass Onion, Blink Twice, The Menu \u2013 you know the sort of thing), then you're in luck: A24 has two on offer this month. In Death of a Unicorn, a father and daughter (Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega) are driving through a nature reserve owned by the father's wealthy boss (Richard E Grant) when their car crashes into a unicorn. Yes, it turns out that these fairy-tale creatures are real, and so are the magical healing properties they're reputed to have. Grant's character and his family \u2013 played by Tea Leoni and Will Poulter \u2013 are keen to exploit these properties, so a team of scientists sets about slicing up the animal's body to determine whether it really can cure cancer. Meanwhile, Opus (released on 14 March in the US) features Ayo Edebiri as a young reporter invited to the compound of a reclusive rock star played by John Malkovich.\nReleased on 28 March in the US and 4 April in the UK\nTwo months on from the release of Steven Soderbergh's last film, Presence, the ever-busy director is back with Black Bag, a spy thriller written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park). Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender play a British married couple who are also suave secret agents \u2013 a combination which isn't a problem until the wife is suspected of treason and the husband has to investigate. \"I [thought] it might be interesting to make [Edward Albee's play] Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but George and Martha are in the intelligence community,\" Soderbergh told The Hollywood Reporter. \"What would that be like? So it's a very, very specific take on people who are in the intelligence business but also have complex personal, emotional lives.\" The stellar cast includes Tom Burke, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page and Marisa Abela, along with two former James Bond regulars, Pierce Brosnan and Naomie Harris.\nReleased on 14 March in cinemas internationally\nThe Alto Knights is a crime thriller about two rival Italian American mob bosses, Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, who go from being best friends to archenemies in 1950s New York. It's directed by Barry Levinson, who made Bugsy, it's scripted by Nicholas Pileggi, the co-writer of Goodfellas, and it stars none other than Robert De Niro, so a fact-based gangster film could hardly have a more promising team behind it. The most intriguing part of the project, though, is that De Niro plays both Costello and Genovese, with just enough prosthetic make-up to stop the characters looking like identical twins. Levinson's explanation for this surprising casting? \"As kids, they were very much the same,\" the director said in Empire. \"Two guys were almost one, then they suddenly not only divide, but ultimately become enemies.\" Whether or not you're convinced, you can't complain about having two De Niro performances for the price of one.\nReleased on 21 March in the UK, the US, Canada, Ireland and Spain\nFive years after Bong Joon Ho's Parasite won the Oscars for best picture, best director, best screenplay and best international feature film, the Korean writer-director is back at last with an English-language science-fiction caper. Adapted from Edward Ashton's novel, Mickey 17 stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey, a lowly labourer on a spaceship bound for an ice planet in the year 2054. He is killed on a regular basis, but he is always \"reprinted\", with his memories and personality intact. But what happens when someone makes a mistake, and two different incarnations of Mickey are alive at the same time? David Ehrlich says in IndieWire that: \"the best and most cohesive of Bong's English-language films [is] his biggest swing to date, a wry, delightful, and resoundingly sweet mega-budget space adventure that doesn't seem to be aware that it was made by a major American studio\". On the other hand, the BBC's Hugh Montgomery felt that Mickey 17 was a \"serious disappointment\".\nReleased from 6 March in cinemas internationally\nThe horrifying story of how Charles Manson brainwashed his followers to murder innocent people in 1969 has been told in many dramas and documentaries: Quentin Tarantino even included it in Once Upon a Time\u2026 In Hollywood. But Chaos, a book by Tom O'Neill with Dan Piepenbring, argues that there is more to the story than the official version of events. According to Elisabeth Garber-Paul in Rolling Stone, the book ponders: \"the links between one of America's most notorious criminals and the government's super-secretive mind-control program MKULTRA\", and asks some disturbing questions: \"What explains the similarities between government funded, LSD-fueled mind-control experiments, and Manson's techniques? And why were there so many people in his orbit who seemed to have ties to the CIA?\" Now this investigation, which consumed 20 years of O'Neill's life, serves as the basis of a documentary by Errol Morris, the legendary director of The Thin Blue Line, The Fog of War and The Pigeon Tunnel.\nReleased on 7 March on Netflix internationally\nDirectors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely worked together on two of the biggest hits in cinema history, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Their next collaboration, The Gray Man, wasn't so well-received, but their new film sees them return to their comfort zone, ie, it's a visual effects-packed science-fiction epic. Based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, a Swedish artist and author, The Electric State is set in a dystopian alternate 1990s where the human race has won a war against robotkind, and the remaining \"bots\" have been exiled to a walled-off desert called the Exclusion Zone. Millie Bobby Brown plays an orphaned teenager, who treks across the Zone in search of her long-lost brother, and Chris Pratt plays a war veteran who goes with her. The only trouble is that the film's story is quite different from the novel's, and some of St\u00e5lenhag's fans aren't happy. \"Fan expectations are complicated,\" Joe Russo told\u00a0Digital Spy. \"There are characters that are directly out of the graphic novel and then there are characters that are completely invented and inspired by it.\"\nReleased on 14 March on Netflix internationally\nOne of this month's two \"having-your-life-changed-by-a-pet-you-didn't-really-want\" comedy dramas (the other being The Friend), The Penguin Lessons is based on a memoir by Tom Michell, and is directed by Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty). Steve Coogan plays Tom, an English teacher who gets what he imagines will be a cushy job in a boys' school in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1976. But there are two complications. One is that Argentina is in the midst of a military coup. The other is that Tom rescued a penguin he found drenched in oil on a beach, and now the bird won't leave him alone. Luckily enough, the penguin's presence in his classroom helps to motivate his pupils \u2013 and it might just teach the cynical Tom a lesson or two. Isabella Soares says in Collider that: \"Cattaneo's latest project is delightful and meaningful\", thanks to Coogan's \"charming\" performance and \"the script's keen eye for comedy in the face of a tumultuous backdrop\".\nReleased on 28 March in the US\nTwo films adapted from novels by Sigrid Nunez premiered last year, both of them musings on death and friendship among literary New Yorkers. One was Pedro Almod\u00f3var's The Room Next Door, which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival; the other is The Friend, which stars Naomi Watts, Bill Murray, and the most gigantic canine to be squeezed into a Manhattan apartment since Clifford the Big Red Dog. Watts plays an author named Iris, and Murray plays her roguish mentor Walter. After he kills himself, Iris has to look after his Great Dane, and finds that the dog is sadder about Walter's death than most of the human beings who knew him. Steve Pond in The Wrap says: \"The Friend juggles the happy, the sad and the bittersweet while somehow managing not to lose the lightness that has kept it afloat.\"\nReleased on 21 March in the US\nAlain Guiraudie, the French writer-director of the award-winning Stranger by the Lake, returns with another blackly comic, sexually charged thriller. F\u00e9lix Kysyl plays J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, a young man who returns to his rural hometown for the funeral of his mentor, a local baker. The baker's widow (Catherine Frot) invites him to stay in the family home, and perhaps even take over the family business, much to the resentment of the couple's grown-up son, Vincent (Jean-Baptiste Durand). And then someone disappears in the mossy woodland by the village. Isaac Feldberg at RogerEbert.com calls Guiraudie's film \"another elegantly haunting dissection of the power dynamics shaping queer sexuality, this time in the form of a fantastically tender, alluring, and peculiar small-town tale of murder, desire, and repression\".\nReleased on 14 March in Spain, 21 March in the US, and 28 March in the UK and Ireland\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Was it pruning or felling? \nThe alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.\nThe chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.\nThe trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.\nBut rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. \n\"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,\" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.\nThe project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000\u20137,000 still left to be mapped.\nDespite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.\nThis is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.\nBut on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.\nThe trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.\nThe Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected \"pleasure gardens\" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. \nThe chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.\nAccording to government literature,  in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. \nEmperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.\nInterestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.   \nBut environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.\n\"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,\" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.\n\"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,\" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.\nChinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.\nGovernment projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.\nLast week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.\n\"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,\" Mr Bhat says. \n\"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.\"",

        "article_text": "Households will need to make significant changes to their lifestyles to help the UK reach net zero by 2050, says the government's independent climate advisers.\nIn its latest advice, known as the carbon budget, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says by 2040, 80% of cars should be electric and one in two homes have a heat pump.\nHere are some of the ways it says you can cut greenhouse gas emissions: \nDecarbonising home heating will be essential if the country is going to reach its legally binding net zero target by 2050.\nOur homes are the second biggest source of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions after transport, and 80% of those emissions are from gas boilers. The proportion has been increasing as the country generates more electricity from low-carbon technologies like renewables and nuclear.\nThe CCC is backing heat pumps as the main replacement for gas boilers and rules out using hydrogen.\nIt says only about 60,000 UK homes installed a heat pump in 2023. It wants that figure to be 450,000 by 2030 and 1.5 million by 2035. \nHowever, it recognises that is going to be difficult. A key problem is heat pumps are typically more expensive than gas boilers, even after the government's \u00a37,500 grant. And because they heat water to a lower temperature than boilers, they work better in well-insulated homes with larger radiators or underfloor heating.\nThe committee says the government needs to consider schemes to help lower income households cover at least some of the costs of these changes.\nThe hope is that as boilers break down, consumers will replace them with heat pumps. The report doesn't recommend a ban on new boilers but says by 2035 all new heating systems should be low carbon.\nA quarter of UK emissions come from transport \u2013 excluding aviation \u2013 making it another priority for carbon cuts. But the CCC is less worried about how these will be achieved.\nThat is because it believes continuing reductions in the cost of batteries and other technologies mean electric cars and vans (EVs) could be cheaper to buy than petrol and diesel vehicles as soon as next year. This is significantly cheaper when you take into account running costs. It believes we will naturally choose them when we're looking for a new car.\nIn 2023, 16% of new cars were fully electric - the government says that will be 55% by 2027 and 95% by 2030.\nThe CCC says government will need to support the rollout of the charging network, and that the cost of charging needs to fall and payment be simplified.\nIt expects the switchover will become increasingly rapid, partly because it believes it will become more difficult to buy petrol and diesel, as it is expected there will be fewer petrol stations by 2040. \nWe are going to need to change our diets, the CCC says. That is because agriculture is the fourth highest emitting sector in the UK economy and nearly two-thirds (63%) of those emissions are from livestock.\nHowever, the CCC is careful not recommend restrictions on what we eat. Instead, it anticipates the current slow drift towards more plant-based foods will continue in the years to come. By 2040 it estimates we will be eating 25% less meat and 20% less dairy.\nMeat products will initially be replaced by existing alternative protein products like plant-based burgers, but in later years it expects us to start eating more \"alternative proteins\".  These include oils and meat grown from animal cells in bio-reactors - fermentation tanks like you might see in a brewery. The first product using these cultivated meats for animal consumption went on sale earlier this month.\nOur changing diets will mean cattle and sheep numbers will need to fall by 27% as a result, it says. That will allow a shift towards woodland creation, the restoration of the country's peatlands and allow more land to be used to grow energy crops.\nUK farmers will need to be supported during this transition, it advises, and the government will need to be careful to ensure that low-carbon UK food is not just replaced by higher-carbon products imported from abroad.\nAviation is currently the sixth biggest source of UK emissions, but by 2040 the CCC reckons it will be the biggest.\nIn the past the committee has advised government there should be no expansion of UK airports without a clear plan to cut emissions from the sector. The government is expected to announce its support for a new runway at Gatwick on Thursday, so is likely to be relieved the CCC has dropped that recommendation from this latest carbon budget.\nBut it says the aviation industry will need to pick up the tab for the costs of decarbonising the sector. That is going to require technological innovation \u2013 more efficient jets and electric planes \u2013 and the increasing use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).\nSAF is made from plant products or by combining captured CO2 with hydrogen. Just 1% of jet fuel is currently SAF, but the CCC expects that to rise to 17% by 2040.\nAny emissions the industry cannot eliminate will need to be offset by what the CCC calls \"engineered removals\". That means using technologies to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it permanently underground.\nAll of which is going to be expensive and will drive up ticket prices. The CCC expects those higher prices will slow down the increase in passenger numbers in years to come. However, it still expects a 28% increase in passenger numbers by 2050 \u2013 with UK residents taking a total of 402 million flights a year.\nIt has a warning though. If all that new tech doesn't cut emissions as much as the industry is expecting, the government may need to impose limits on flight numbers.",

        "article_text": "Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.\nFor those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.\n\"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,\" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.\n\"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live.\"\nYulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.\nBefore the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.\nBefore Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.\n\"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,\" says 30-year-old Andriy. \"They don't respect the people of Ukraine.\"\n\"It looks like Washington supports Russia!\" observes Dmytro, 26.\nYou wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.\n\"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,\" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.\nWorld leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.\nHis ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.\nBut Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.\nNot least with his warming to Russia.\nThe initial reaction was that of shock,\" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.\n\"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,\" she adds. \"It's painful.\"\nUkrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.\nPerhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.\n\"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,\" argues Sovsun.\nThere are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.\n\"It's important to find the right mediator,\" she says. \"Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.\n\"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy.\"\nPresident Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.\n\"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,\" she adds. \"Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war.\"\nWhat the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.\n\"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,\" she says.\nWhile there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.\nHer European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.\nHe was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as \"threats to national security\" and \"creating obstacles to economic development\". Mr Poroshenko said it was \"politically motivated\".\nDespite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.\nAs sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.\nRussia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.\n\"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,\" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.\nAfter Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,\" he says.\nAs he ruthlessly pursues his \"America First\" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.\n\"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,\" says Mr Chmut.\n\"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Svitlana Libet.",

Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others.\nIt also launched a review into the film, and the BBC's Board met earlier on Thursday to discuss it.\nIn the statement, a BBC spokesperson said both the production company and the BBC had made \"unacceptable\" flaws and that it \"takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation\".\nIt added the BBC had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company.\nThe spokesperson says: \"During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas.\n\"Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact. \n\"It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.\"\nHoyo Films have told the corporation that they paid the young boy's mother \"a limited sum of money\" for narrating the film via his sister's bank account, the BBC statement added.\nIt said Hoyo assured the BBC that no payments were made to any members of Hamas or its affiliates \"either directly, in kind or as a gift\", and that it is seeking \"additional assurance\" around the programme's budget. \nIn its statement, Hoyo added: \"We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors \u2013 who have no say in the war \u2013 should have their voices heard\".\n\nA full audit of the expenditure on the film will be undertaken by the BBC, and it will be asking for the relevant financial accounts of Hoyo Films so this can be carried out.  \nThe BBC spokesperson said the incident had \"damaged\" the trust in the Corporation's journalism - and \"the processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations\".\nThey added the director-general of the BBC had asked for complaints to be expedited to the Executive Complaints Unit, \"which is separate from BBC News\".\nA separate statement from the BBC Board added: \"The subject matter of the documentary was clearly a legitimate area to explore, but nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. While the board appreciates that mistakes can be made, the mistakes here are significant and damaging to the BBC.\"\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the film during a press conference with US President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he had been \"concerned\" about it, adding that \"the secretary of state has had a meeting with the BBC\".\nOn Friday, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she was going to have an \"urgent meeting\" with the BBC chair Samir Shah later that day. \nShe said the BBC had \"acknowledged serious failings\" by them and the production company Hoyo Films.\n\"I want assurances that no stone will be left unturned by the fact-finding review now commissioned by the BBC's director general,\" she said. \n\"This review must be comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened in this case.

I knew I was not Messi or anyone, I was Bojan. \n\"But when people demand for you to be at that level, it is difficult to live with that expectation.  \n\"It was difficult to find a way.\"\nEuro Leagues: An interview with Bojan, & the Magic of the Cup\nBojan's career appeared to be skyrocketing. \nIn February 2008, only a few months after making his first-team debut at Barcelona, he was called up by Spain to play in a friendly against France.\nBut his international debut was delayed as he withdrew, and then declined an invitation to be part of the Spain squad for Euro 2008 - a tournament they went on to win.\nIllness and personal reasons were cited at the time for him pulling out of both but a decade later, Bojan says he was suffering from anxiety issues.\n\"As a football player the people do not know what is behind the football bit,\" he added.\n\"In the moment I suffered a lot but at the same point I knew it was something that was making me strong. \n\"At the end of my career I wanted to tell my story, but not as Bojan the footballer but Bojan the human, because I know this is a story that can not only help football people but also in general. \n\"As soon as I told my story I felt I closed all the experiences.\"\nBojan played for Stoke between 2014 and 2019\nBojan had three more seasons at Barcelona, but he struggled to match those early expectations and had spells away from the club with Roma, AC Milan and Ajax.\nBut in 2014 he decided to sever ties completely with Barcelona and opted to pursue the opportunity of playing in the Premier League by signing permanently for Stoke.\n\"It was one of the first big decisions I made in my career,\" Bojan said. \"It was to cut the umbilical cord with Barcelona after 12 years. \n\"I decided to do it because I knew it was the right decision, but in the moment it was hurting me a lot.\"\nHowever, the anxiety issues that Bojan had been struggling with became so difficult that he was unable to fly out to join up with Stoke, despite having boarded the plane to leave Spain.\n\"The plane was going to the sky but I was feeling 'wow, I cannot fly' and that is why I stopped the plane,\" he said.\nBojan returned home but was able to fly the following day and linked up with the Stoke squad at a training camp in Germany.\nAt the Potters he made 53 appearances in the Premier League, scoring 14 goals, and it is a move that he credits as one of the best of his career.\n\"For me, Stoke gave me a big opportunity to play for them and in the Premier League,\" he said.\n\"We built one of the biggest moments in Stoke's story. The fans and the players will always be in my heart and I've always said my top level in my career I did with them.\"\nBojan may not have been the next Messi but he was forging an impressive career at Stoke, with his form leading to links with moves to Liverpool and Manchester United.\nBut a serious knee injury in January 2015 disrupted his progress and he was never the same again. Spells at Mainz and Alaves followed before he finished his career in Japan, retiring in 2022.\nThe following year he returned to Barcelona, taking on the football co-ordinator role, and while he may only be a couple of years older than some of those in the current first-team, he is enjoying his new life off the pitch.\n\"I don't miss playing football,\" he said. \n\"I feel that was the end of a chapter in my life, I felt proud about what I did and what I learned from the good and the bad experiences. \n\"I see the players now when they are training and playing and I feel already I did this, and now I am on another step and looking forward.\"\nListen to the full interview with Bojan Krkic on the Euro Leagues podcast on BBC Sounds.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Plymouth have already shocked Brentford and Liverpool in the FA Cup this season, but can they upset another Premier League team, Manchester City, in round five?\n\"Argyle have gone really direct under new manager Miron Muslic,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"It's a great clash of styles with the possession football that Pep Guardiola plays, but the problem if you keep going long against City is that you keep giving them the ball back.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all eight fifth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against comedian and Plymouth fan Josh Widdicombe.\nWiddicombe is touring the UK with his 'Not My Cup Of Tea' stand-up show in 2025 and 2026, which culminates with two nights at the Hackney Empire in London.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nWiddicombe co-hosts the Parenting Hell podcast with Rob Beckett and recently triumphed on BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special\nJosh missed Plymouth's famous win over Liverpool in round four because he was at a Strictly Come Dancing Live Show with his daughter, so will he be at Etihad Stadium this weekend?\n\"No, I will be in Chipping Norton, doing a preview show for my tour,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"My on-stage time will be 7.30pm which would be when injury time starts. That's life!\n\"I was actually disappointed we got City because when you get into the fifth round of the FA Cup, you start thinking that, if we get an easy draw, we are in the quarter-finals. \n\"So, City were the worst possible draw, really. The fact the FA Cup is the only thing they can win doesn't help much either. If they were playing in the Champions League next week we would be in a slightly better position.\n\"Still, the longer we go without conceding, the more I will dare to dream. I would obviously take penalties now, in a heartbeat, even though I would be on stage.\n\"Although, by the time penalties happen, after all the injury time and extra time, it might be around 8.15pm, which is when my break usually is.\n\"That's what I am going to be wishing for, because I might just get to see a shootout - but honestly let's just hope the tie is still up for grabs when I go on stage.\"\nWiddicombe (right) poses with famous Bolton fan Vernon Kay before the 2023 Papa Johns Trophy final - the last time Plymouth reached Wembley. Sadly for Josh, the Pilgrims lost 4-0\nJosh co-hosted the cult podcast about 1990s football 'Quickly Kevin, Will He Score?' between 2017 and 2024 and feels that decade was full of classic FA Cup moments.\n\"There were lots of iconic finals in the 1990s,\" he added. \"I can instantly tell you the result and every goalscorer of every one, while I am struggling to tell you who won it last year.\n\"That's because of a combination of two things - firstly, in the same way you remember what was Christmas number one when you were a kid, everything is more vivid the first time around - it is more exciting and seems to matter more.\n\"Also, sadly, the FA Cup is not nearly as important as it was. You've even got some Plymouth fans saying they would rather stay up than win it this season - my response to that is 'are you clinically insane? Who cares if we stay up!'.\n\"In a few years you are not going to say 'oh thank God we are in the Championship. You are going to go 'can you remember when we won the FA Cup!?!' That's what you dream about.\n\"Those one-off events are the things you cling on to, and in a strange way I am glad that because I wasn't able to go to our win over Liverpool, I was at Strictly Live with my daughter instead.\n\"That makes it more of a memory for me. I will always remember where I was when it happened, and it wasn't just the case where I was at home watching on TV and then I had to go to the park.\"\nChris Sutton and Josh Widdicombe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nVilla Park, 20:00 GMT\n10th in Premier League v 19th in Championship\nGap = 29\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe rest of the season is going to be a bit of a juggling act for Aston Villa.\nThey are still in the Champions League and also trying to finish high enough in the Premier League to qualify for it again next season.\nSo, it will be interesting to see if they target the FA Cup too. I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.\nStill, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.\nLet's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.\nCardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.\nThey may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nJosh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. \nSo, there is quite a lot in this for them while, in contrast, if any of the Championship teams are going to be focused on the league it is Cardiff. 3-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup moment: It would probably be Wrexham beating Arsenal in 1992 with Mickey Thomas's free-kick for their equaliser. I don't like Wrexham now because they are the big dogs of the lower leagues but that was the iconic upset of my childhood.\nIt was probably the first big one that I saw for myself. When I was a kid, all the same FA Cup upsets used to get talked about all the time - like Hereford against Newcastle - but this was the first proper one I remember, after Arsenal had won the league and Wrexham had finished bottom.\nThis video can not be played\nFA Cup Archive: Wrexham upset Arsenal in 1992\nSelhurst Park, 12:15 GMT\n12th in Premier League v 12th in Championship\nGap = 8\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWill in-form Crystal Palace go for it in the FA Cup? I really hope so.\nOliver Glasner's side have improved as the season has gone on and they are comfortably in mid-table of the Premier League without any danger of going down. A cup run would really cap this as a successful campaign for him.\nIt would have an even bigger impact for Palace's fans. I still remember Ian Wright's goals in the 1990 final where they lost to Manchester United in a replay. They lost to United in the 2016 final too, and it would be great to give them a new memory.\nThis won't be easy, because former Norwich boss Alex Neil took charge of Millwall at the end of last year and is doing a good job.\nThey have been quite stubborn in recent weeks and I'm expecting more of the same here, but the Eagles should edge it in normal time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: We beat Millwall 5-1 off the back of of our win over Liverpool, which was a bit of a freak result. Normally you'd lose straight after that kind of game. \nLike Villa, Palace are another team who should be going for the FA Cup but Millwall have reached the final in my lifetime, even if it was fully 21 years ago. \nI'd gone for a replay at first, before I remembered there aren't any - the death of FA Cup replays is very sad, isn't it? 1-1 after extra time, then Millwall to win on penalties\nDeepdale, 12:15 GMT\n15th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\nGap = 12\nWatch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nThis will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.\nIt ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.\nMaybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?\nBurnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.\nPreston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.\nLet's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penalties\nJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support. \nBurnley in contrast are one of the six teams that are forever going to switch between the Premier League and the Championship. They are trying to win promotion this time by not conceding any goals whatsoever, which is different, but still not very exciting for their fans. \nThis is a local derby, but it is such a dry game. I'll go 1-0 to Burnley - no, 1-0 to Preston. 1-0\nVitality Stadium, 15:00 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 17th in Premier League\nGap = 10\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWolves won here in the Premier League on Saturday but only after Bournemouth had Illia Zabarnyi sent off in the first half. That completely skewed that result so I am not using it as a form guide for this tie.\nWhat will be more relevant is how many changes both teams make for this game. \nI was at Wolves' win over Blackburn in round four and their manager Vitor Pereira went kind of half-strong there. I can guarantee you he will be prioritising Premier League survival ahead of FA Cup progress, so we will probably see another mix-and-match selection from him here too.\nAs for Bournemouth, well I have already talked about why Crystal Palace should be trying to win the FA Cup this season, and the same definitely applies to Andoni Iraola's side.\nThe Cherries have only reached the quarter-finals twice before, losing at that stage in 1957 and 2021, and their best moments in the competition are probably as a lower-league giantkiller, such as when they beat Manchester United as a third-tier team in 1984.\nThis year they are genuine contenders to win it and lift the club's first major trophy, and they have already shown they can beat anyone, especially at home. \nThey are still seventh in the Premier League despite losing their past two matches, and I would be really disappointed - no, actually I'd be angry - if Iraola picks a weakened team in the situation they are in.\nHe has got a responsibility to the fans to try to reach the semi-finals for the first time. Yes they have got a chance of making the Champions League, which would be incredible, but they are only two wins away from their biggest day out ever at Wembley. Why not go for it?\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: Usually, the result never recurs when teams play each other twice in a short space of time, so I am backing Bournemouth. 2-0\nEtihad Stadium, 17:45 GMT\n4th in Premier League v 22nd in Championship\nGap = 38\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe FA Cup is Manchester City's only realistic chance of a trophy this season, so there is no chance they will lack focus here.\nCity come into this tie off the back of a good win at Tottenham on Wednesday, which I predicted. The readers went for a Spurs victory, which was just ridiculous - what on earth were you thinking?\nI am going for Pep Guardiola's side to win this comfortably, but fair play to Plymouth for getting this far.\nThey have knocked out Liverpool and won at Brentford but it is going to be third time unlucky for them against Premier League teams.\nWith what is at stake for them, City cannot let this one slip - and they won't.\nSutton's prediction: 5-0\nJosh's prediction: I think it is absurd when fans predict victories for their own team. They do it all the time, while I just go into every game thinking we are going to lose - that is my attitude to life, that surely this is going to go wrong.\nSo, I think we are going to lose every game 4-0, which actually feels like a worthwhile prediction here. Then you are always pleasantly surprised - well, maybe not always, but most of the time - when you don't. \nWe have played very, kind of, pretty football for the past five years but under our new manager, our playing style is, shall we say, a little more industrial these days.\nIt's much worse when you are at home trying to break down a team in the Championship but it is perfect for this scenario, away at Manchester City. We are practising the right type of football to cause an FA Cup upset but the truth of it is that we are not going to win, so who cares!? 4-0\nJosh on who will win the FA Cup? I obviously want Plymouth to win it but I think City will do it. So, in a way, this is one of those games where people say 'this is the real final'. Whoever wins out of Plymouth and City will go on and win the FA Cup.\nSt James' Park, 13:45 GMT\n6th in Premier League v 8th in Premier League\nGap = 2\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nAlexander Isak missed Newcastle's defeat at Anfield with a groin injury so he has to be a doubt for this tie too, and his absence is a massive blow for Eddie Howe's side.\nBrighton have hit a bit of form since losing 7-0 to Nottingham Forest at the start of February, and have won four in a row in the Premier League and FA Cup.\nThe Seagulls also won at St James' Park earlier in the season, when Danny Welbeck got the winner. I remember that one because I got that prediction wrong.\nPeople are talking about Newcastle being distracted by their upcoming Carabao Cup final against Liverpool [on 16 March] but could they actually be in line for a domestic cup double this season?\nI am banking on them keeping that possibility alive here. They obviously could really do with having Isak back but, even if he is not fit, then surely Brighton can't win there twice this season... can they?\nSutton's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Newcastle are never going to win the FA Cup - they are always constantly about to win the FA Cup, and about to win their first trophy. I mean obviously they have got the Carabao Cup final coming up but, no, Newcastle will never win the FA Cup. Brighton are quite a 1980s team, aren't they, because of when they reached the Cup final in 1983? Let's see that again. 1-2\nOld Trafford, 16:30 GMT\n14th in Premier League v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nI am sick of backing Manchester United. Even though they beat Ipswich on Wednesday, they did not half make hard work of it and the Tractor Boys ran them close at Old Trafford.\nAlejandro Garnacho appeared to have a bit of a hissy fit after being hooked before half-time, so it will be interesting to see how Ruben Amorim deals with that. He won't have any players left at this rate if he decides to leave Garnacho out.\nUnited are the FA Cup holders and they have beaten Fulham home and away already this season but on both occasions it was far from convincing, and I don't really care about that anyway.\nAmorim is a likeable guy, and I've got sympathy for him about the size of his task at Old Trafford but, from watching United, I cannot think of any reason to back them to win this. \nI am usually wrong about Fulham, but they are going to take this one - 100%.\nSutton's prediction: 0-3\nJosh's prediction: I can see United getting to the cup final this year. They were quite jammy on their way to winning it last year - against Coventry in the semi-final for example - but were they actually jammy? It meant they kept Erik ten Hag for another six months which is probably the worst thing which could have happened to them. I don't know if that FA Cup win has made this season much worse. 2-0\nCity Ground, 19:30 GMT\n3rd in Premier League v 18th in Premier League\nGap = 15\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna made 11 changes when his side beat Coventry in round four and I suspect he will do something similar here.\nYou might have heard about 'Sutton's Super Computer', which were the calculations I did for the Monday Night Club this week, where I worked out the results of all the remaining Premier League fixtures.\nAccording to my secret formula, which is obviously extremely scientific, the Tractor Boys only have an outside chance of staying up. Along with Leicester they were in my 'no-hopers' category.\nMaybe Ipswich can surprise me and go on an FA Cup run, but you have to fancy Nottingham Forest here.\nDefeat would just leave a grim fight against relegation for McKenna's side, so I feel for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who regular readers will know follows the Tractor Boys, but not so much for my 5 Live colleague Ali Bruce-Ball who is a phony Ipswich supporter - when I asked him, he could not remember the last time he went to watch them as a fan.\nOne thing I really can't stand are people like Bruce who attach themselves to a club which has a bit of success, claiming some tenuous link from the past.\nMy boyhood team Forest may make changes too because they are still in a good position for a Champions League spot, but I am backing Chris Wood to come off the bench and get us a winner.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Forest are another throwback team who do not seem to have had a decent Cup run for a long time. 2-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup final of the 1990s: Spurs versus Forest in 1991 was a really important and seismic one, because of Gazza [Paul Gascoigne] and what it did to his career. \nThere were some other great ones too, though, like 1997 when Middlesbrough lost to Chelsea. That was quite fun because of Roberto di Matteo's goal after 47 seconds. \nThen there was 1995 when Manchester United lost to Everton after they had been going for the Double and lost everything, and even 1993 was interesting because Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday met in both domestic cup finals. I'm not going to, but you could write a book about the history of 90s football based around those finals, because they mattered so much then.\nChris has six correct results from the nine midweek Premier League games played so far in week 27, with one exact score, giving him 90 points.\nWith one game still to be played, he is level with his guest, singer Paige Cavell, who also has six correct results with one exact score.\nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, the BBC readers got three correct results with no exact scores, giving them 30 points.\nThey can no longer win this week, but the outcome of Thursday's game between West Ham and Leicester will decide whether Chris or Paige takes the victory.\nChris has gone for a 2-0 Hammers success while Paige has picked a 1-1 draw.",

You are going to go 'can you remember when we won the FA Cup!?!' I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.Still, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.Let's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.Cardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.They may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Josh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. This will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.It ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.Maybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?Burnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.Preston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.Let's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.Sutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penaltiesJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support.",

        "article_text": "French photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 captured this dystopian scene as the world headed towards lockdown in February 2020.\nOn Saturday 25 January 2020, millions of Chinese people started celebrating the Lunar New Year. The country's megacities saw huge temporary migrations as people left to celebrate with friends and family in distant towns and cities, as they did every January.\nThat year, however, there was a dramatic difference. Many of the people who left to celebrate were unable to return for weeks or even months. A type of pneumonia that had appeared in the western Chinese city of Wuhan the previous December had quietly became a concern. By the time Chinese revellers boarded trains and planes home a month later it had become a crisis.\nFrench photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 was in Beijing at that very moment, as the seriousness of the Wuhan virus became more evident. \"The photo editor at the New York Times had asked me to roam Beijing and take some pictures of the atmosphere. I just gotten back from holidays and I didn't know what to expect.\"\nWuhan was already in lockdown, though these measures hadn't yet been adopted by other Chinese cities. Even so, Sabri\u00e9 found the city sombre and eerily quiet. \"There were very, very few people anywhere. Most restaurants were closed. Everybody was worried that the disease would spread to Beijing.\n\"What made the situation probably more anxious is people didn't have much trust in what the authorities were saying. Initially, they had said there was no human-to-human transmission, then, just a few days later, they reverse and then go into full lockdown for Wuhan, a city of 10 million.\"\nSabri\u00e9 says the Chinese authorities had stressed that there had been few deaths in Beijing, a city of 23 million people. \"The question is, could we trust those figures? That was a big thing,\" Sabri\u00e9 says. Beijing's citizens began to shy away from the routines of city life, encouraged by public health messages to limit the spread. \"It was not a firm lockdown, like you had to stay home, but basically, you were encouraged to limit your movements,\" Sabri\u00e9 says.\nThe result was an eerie emptiness in a city usually bustling with life. The subways were empty; those who hadn't left for the provinces were staying home. The stillness was dramatic, but lacked a human reference point. \"It was quite paradoxical, because when you need to shoot something empty, actually you need people. If it's fully empty, it's not as strong.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Covid-19: The heat-showing shape of things to come\n\u2022\u00a0Is Covid becoming less deadly?\n\u2022\u00a0Why Covid-19 isn't yet seasonal\nSabri\u00e9 had an idea. Near Beijing is a resort area called Lake Houhai, a locale with many traditional houses and usually packed with sightseers day and night. When he turned up, \"it was around dinner time\", Sabri\u00e9 says, when the area would usually be crowded with people. \"This place is a must-see for any tourist, Chinese or foreign, who comes and visits Beijing. It's full of bars [and] tourist shops. Those bars usually play very loud music\u2026 each bar is louder than the next one, trying to attract more people.\"\nInstead, the bars were silent and the streets empty. Then Sabri\u00e9 spotted just one bar that wasn\u2019t completely void of life. Behind the pane of a large window, sat a lone man, softly illuminated by an overhead light. \"He was there by himself in the middle of this place which should have been bustling with life and music and sound and people,\" says Sabri\u00e9. But there was this man \"having his dinner from plastic dishes, his only companion a cat unaware of what was going on, of the tension and the anxiety\".\nThe photo is a scene in which more appears the longer you look at it. The man sits amid the normal detritus of a makeshift meal, his face gently lit by the glow of his phone. Around him lies the plush bar seating, a red pillar, the lights of bar in the background. At the bottom of the frame, a cat crouches on the back of a sofa. It could have been snapped in the small hours, once all the revellers have headed home. But instead, it's a marker: the end of normal life as a megacity hunkers down.\n\"I didn't get into the bar,\" Sabri\u00e9 explains. \"I just put my camera against [the] window. I don't think he ever noticed me, and I took the picture and moved on.\"\u00a0\nSabri\u00e9 says he thought little of the image after he took it, but the picture clearly resonated with the New York Times picture desk: the image was used as part of their The Great Empty special, published the following month. Sabri\u00e9 notes that the figure is unmasked \u2013 something that was becoming rare to see on the streets as the pandemic ramped up.\nSabri\u00e9's appreciation for the image has grown with the distance of five years. \"You have the darkness that reflects the darkness of the time, and the anxiety that we were feeling,\" he says. \"If you look closely at the picture, the [man] is looking at his phone.\"\nThis, Sabri\u00e9 adds, depicts another kind of darkness \"in terms of information and knowledge\" as people scoured the internet for information, in a desperate effort to understand what was happening to the world.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "England's men have won only one of their past 11 matches across three formats\nAnd so English cricket limps to its final stop of the winter.\nKarachi, where England will exit the Champions Trophy after Saturday's game against South Africa, is known as the City of Lights. Their last visit, the completion of a 3-0 Test series win in Pakistan in 2022, was Bazball's brightest moment. Now Brendon McCullum and his men cannot shake the dark clouds.\nAdele could write an album about how miserable England's 2025 has been so far. \nThe end of 2024 wasn't much better. The women dropped themselves out of the T20 World Cup and the men were spun out in Pakistan. Heather Knight's side at least won in South Africa and Ben Stokes' men claimed an impressive win in New Zealand, then soured it with a stag-do of a performance in the final Test in Hamilton.\nSince the turn of the year it has been a shambles: the women thrashed all over Australia, the men one win from 10 in McCullum's new white-ball era. Andrew Flintoff's Lions were hammered in South Africa and Australia, and the Under-19 women were well beaten in a World Cup semi-final by India. Thank goodness Archie Vaughan's Under-19 men won their Test series against South Africa.\nIt's probably good to get a few things straight before delving into this: all of us - fans, media and pundits - want England to do well. We care. It hurts when they lose.\nIt is also fair to say I have never met an England player that is not desperate to succeed. They may occasionally forget the England team exists for everyone, not just the individuals in the dressing room, but there is an understandable element of self-preservation at play. Dreams and careers are on the line. Professional sport is cut-throat.\nWe must also be careful to not rewrite history. McCullum was a breath of fresh air to English cricket, both in terms of results and the feeling towards the men's national team. It seemed a no-brainer to put him in charge of the white-ball side, largely because any other coach would have existed in the New Zealander's shadow.\nJon Lewis did similar with the women's team, even if Bazball-lite seemed too simplistic. The draw with Australia in the home Ashes of 2023 was creditable, and probably should have been better given Australia had lost Meg Lanning.\n'McCullum's problems go far beyond Buttler's future'\nEngland need more variety than just 90mph bowlers - Vaughan\nReplacing Buttler the sensible thing to do - Agnew\nAs 2024 wore into 2025 and results became indifferent for both teams, nagging doubts became worries and have now grown into genuine concerns.\nWill Ben Stokes be fully fit again? What has happened to Issy Wong? Why was Josh Hull picked? How did Flintoff go from TV presenter to some of the most high-profile coaching gigs in the country? Why did Dan Lawrence open the batting? Why did Kate Cross captain England in Ireland when it was a golden development opportunity for a youngster? Who signed off on one frontline spinner for a Champions Trophy in Pakistan? What is going on with Shoaib Bashir's bowling? Why do England women drop so many catches? We could go on and on.\nThere are recurring themes across the England national teams. The women have been accused of not being fit enough, the men of not training enough. Both charges are probably unfair, yet the players don't help their public image. \nWe're bored with hearing the men talk about golf and the women were downright daft to be pictured on a boat party during the T20 World Cup in Dubai. These England teams are not lazy, though they can be slapdash.\nThe rhetoric is maddening, too. Many legendary leaders have successfully paired public praise with private criticism, and listening to McCullum in particular can inspire even a jobbing journalist to take on the world. But some of the utterances of the men wind up fans and opposition, while the women were borderline delusional in Australia. Lewis' Bondi to Coogee walk will live in infamy, and the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook are never far from a crass soundbite.\nNone of this matters if England teams are winning. They aren't, which means Rob Key and Clare Connor - directors of cricket of the men's and women's team respectively - have thinking to do.\nIt seems a decent bet that Connor will be looking for a new women's head coach. A review into the Ashes is still taking place and could run until the end of next month. It may be that Knight stays on as captain, partly because she remains an excellent leader and partly because England's succession planning has been awful. Whoever is in charge must get the best out of Sophie Ecclestone on and off the pitch, while a bigger question is whether England have the right structural set-up to consistently compete with the Australians.\nKey's decisions on personnel are probably more straightforward. Jos Buttler sounded like a man ready to make up his own mind on the white-ball captaincy, with Brook most likely to take over. Where it gets trickier for Key, McCullum and the new skipper is reviving the fortunes of the white-ball team in a defining year for the Test side.\nThis video can not be played\nAfghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy\nOn one hand, it is harsh to compare the current white-ball team to the class of 2019, England's greatest team led by their greatest captain Eoin Morgan.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that a white-ball empire has crumbled on Key's watch. It is not his fault domestic 50-over cricket has been marginalised, but the treatment of David Willey, dropping of Sam Curran and Reece Topley, overlooking of Liam Dawson, obsession with pace over skill, lack of death bowlers and left-handed batters all fall at his door. How did England take the field in the Champions Trophy with as many wicketkeepers as frontline bowlers?\nWhereas there was once separation between the Test and white-ball set-ups, greater alignment runs the risk of a malaise from one format bleeding into the other. There is at least a decent break before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.\nUntil then, questions abound. Have England broken Mark Wood in a tournament he probably shouldn't have been playing in? What state is Stokes' hamstring in? Can Bashir become the spinner England need in Australia? Can Zak Crawley reach double figures? Is Test vice-captain Ollie Pope going to be dropped to make way for Jacob Bethell?\nNone of this gloom needs to be terminal. The women's game is about to get a huge boost from the new domestic structure and the men have every chance of winning their five-Test series against India. There is a wealth of young male and female talent coming through and the Ashes next winter has all the ingredients to be a classic.\nFor now, this winter cannot end quickly enough. Last rites and alarm bells will not be drowned out by good vibes.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

After escaping with a draw despite a woeful first 70 minutes at Everton last Saturday, 48 hours later chief executive Omar Berrada was telling staff up to 200 jobs could go in a second round of redundancies.\nIt took a backs-to-the-wall second-half display against relegation-threatened Ipswich on Wednesday to claim a vital Premier League win after more defensive mistakes and Patrick Dorgu's red card threatened a sixth home defeat of Amorim's short reign.\nThe Portuguese says life is \"hard\" just now - but remains convinced better times lie ahead.\n\"I see a clear path, and I see that from the board also,\" he said in the build-up to Sunday's home FA Cup fifth-round tie against Fulham. \"They are also doing difficult changes.\n\"They are not popular but they are doing it because they have a vision. In the future we need to show some results. You can do a lot of changes but if you don't have results, people don't feel confident and happy.\n\"The good thing is we have a clear path. Now [it] is hard but we are doing things to achieve success in the future.\"\nUnited's inconsistency puts even more focus on the two cup competitions they remain in - they face Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday - as it appears increasingly likely winning one of them is the only way they will qualify for European football next season.\nThe issues he is facing are so extensive, Amorim could be forgiven for wishing he had stuck to his initial demand not to leave Sporting until the end of the season.\nHowever, he does think dealing with so many problems has made him a more rounded coach.\n\"Better [coach] is hard to say, because I am not winning games,\" he said. \"But in three months here, I live certain things that I think make me a more complete manager.\n\"Sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow. I am not going to die if I lose three games in a row. I learned that here. I can cope and maintain my energy. I am learning a lot about myself and the players - but I prefer to win games.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "These were already turbulent times in Romania.\nBut as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.\nA country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.\nWas a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport's female pioneers.\nIn 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLast October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted.\n\"I think it's sad that it took so long, but I think it's fantastic that we're in a different place now,\" Carter says.\nOctober's ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together.\n\"There was a camaraderie that was built in '96,\" Carter says. \"We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we'd never been away from each other.\"\nGreat Britain's players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts.\n\"I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,\" McIntosh says. \"Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me.\"\nBut there's one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find.\nGreat Britain's team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing\nBritain's players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series.\nIn that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield.\nThree years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn't turned up.\n\"We thought we'd brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,\" McIntosh says. \"But it's not.\"\nThe mystery remains unresolved. \"Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,\" Sheldon says. \"I've got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield.\"\nIf anyone does have it, they're sitting on a piece of history. \n\"It's in somebody's attic, because I can't see where else it would have gone,\" Carter says. \"So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!\"",

        "article_text": "YouTube started out as an off-beat video sharing site. But at its 20th anniversary, the platform's content has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with each other.\nIn 2006, Time Magazine named its annual Person of the Year: you. \"Yes you,\" the magazine read. \"You control the Information Age. Welcome to your world.\" Its cover featured a mirror to reflect reader's image \u2013 emblazoned on a computer screen tuned to a site modelled after YouTube. It was just a year after YouTube's launch, but already, it had shifted our understanding of the role we would play in the coming era.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. It's gone from a novel tool to an unshakable pillar of technological infrastructure. Some 2.5 billion people log on every month. The company says people who watch YouTube on their TVs consume a billion hours of video a day, to say nothing of time spent on the app and website. But as much as YouTube changed how we use the internet, it's had an equally significant impact on our offline lives.\n\"Not long ago virtually no one took YouTube that seriously,\" journalist Mark Bergen writes in his book Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"But in so many ways, YouTube had set the stage for modern social media, making decisions throughout its history that shaped how attention, money, ideology, and everything else worked online.\"\nYouTube videos have occupied a massive share of our collective consciousness, dictating what brings us together, what drives us apart, what makes us laugh, cry and cringe. \"All the dynamics of social media \u2013 of attention, fame, disrupting old school media \u2013 have mostly grown because of the financial model YouTube built,\" Bergen tells the BBC. Human nature itself has shifted in the last 20 years, and as seen in these five videos, YouTube would become a nexus point for the way we see ourselves and each other.\nLong before the video stitching on TikTok or remixing on Instagram reels, there was Canon Rock, uploaded just 10 months after YouTube's founding. South Korean musician Jeong-Hyun Lim, known online as funtwo, sits in his bedroom with an electric guitar, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap and pixelated footage. A backing track plays the chords to Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D, and Lim joins in, his guitar work subdued in line with the 300-year-old piece. But Lim's playing \u00a0grows more intricate until, about 40 seconds in, he launches into a blazing solo, fingers gliding across the fretboard.\nThe reaction was explosive. As the video racked up hits, around 900 users sent direct video responses to Canon Rock \u2013 big numbers at a time when uploading videos meant plugging in a digital camera \u2013 and thousands more posted their own covers of the song. In 2007, YouTube user Impeto uploaded a compilation of dozens of Canon Rock videos edited into one continuous track, almost as though the whole internet was playing along together. Deft musicianship wasn't new to the web, but the user participation was.\nCanon Rock created a \"reciprocity between artists\" that opened the door for people to see each other as creative partners, says Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University in the US. By democratising the creative process, YouTube created a melting pot for different communities with different interests and skills to make the internet their own.\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our story on the YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know.\nIt helped inspire a new era of online collaboration, according to Jean Burgess, a digital media professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Videos like funtwo's weren't just a performance, Burgess says, they were an invitation, a \"showcasing of skill and the setting of standards for other players in the 'game' to attain or beat\".\nToday's video platforms bombard us with marketing partnerships and endless threads of political discourse. But the musicians behind Canon Rock represented a simpler time, where collaboration was not an economic or ideological proposition, but instead a space where online bedroom dwellers were learning to see each other as members of a global community, a project they were all embarking on together.\nEarly YouTube audiences will probably be familiar with the saga of Bree, better known by the username lonelygirl15. Her story began as a homeschooled girl posting simple videos about her daily life. But things took a bizarre turn when Bree discovered her family was involved with a strange religious cult. Over the weeks and months, the narrative grew more convoluted; Bree ultimately went on the run, investigating secret codes, eluding religious acolytes and fighting a sinister organisation.\nIt was all fiction, of course. But lonelygirl15's start was so mundane that many didn't question the story until the drama was too fantastic to ignore. \"Bree\" had an enigmatic realness \u2013 she was actively connecting with fans on MySpace and corresponding with journalists, and even the New York Times was still asking whether the series was truth or a hoax before the final episode. It sparked ferocious debate in online forums, with viewers picking apart everything from her narrative to the quality of her video production.\n\"[Lonelygirl15] seemed to captivate so many, drawing people who maybe didn\u2019t know what YouTube really was into the fold,\" says Duffy. \"The authenticity, the relatability, the vulnerability, the expressive sharing.\"\nBeyond satire, the series was a pointed effort to use the tropes and norms of social media to misguide the audience. It marked a major development on the internet, where some realised for the first time just how blurry the lines between fact and fiction had become, Duffy says.\nLonelygirl15 was a sea change for many users' relationships to each other, and it forced some people to examine the identities that they themselves were creating online, Bergen says. \"In some ways, the lonelygirl15 series was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"It was a clever commentary about the fact that authenticity doesn't really exist online \u2013 you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one.\"\nIt raised questions about discerning truth on the web, and helped establish a new order where every post, no matter how innocuous, is subject to interrogation and distrust.\nIt's 2011. A young man sits in front of a map of the world. His hands and voice are shaky as he calls his father on the phone. The man is Randy Phillips, an airman in the US Air Force, and he is filming himself telling his dad that he is gay.\nPhillips ran a channel called \"AreYouSurprised\" detailing his life under the US's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy. In his previous videos, Phillips positioned the camera to keep his face just out of view, but hours after the 16-year policy was repealed, he was on full display. Phillips wasn't the only one. His post was an early example of the \"coming out\" video, a YouTube genre that became more and more influential as time went on.\n\"Watching real LGBTQ+ people share their own coming out journeys across platforms like YouTube definitely provided an opportunity for queer and transgender people all over the world to realise they were not alone,\" says Zach Eisenstein, director of communications at The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\u00a0\"When YouTube was just starting up, I was a teenager figuring out my own identity,\" he says. \"It helped me exponentially as I navigated my own coming out journey.\"\nThe offline world was in the throes of change. It would be four years until the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, but following a global economic recession that highlighted growing inequality and shifting political climates, social attitudes were becoming more inclusive.\nTyler Oakley, one of the first major openly gay personalities on the platform, launched the \"Coming Out\" challenge in 2011, encouraging his audience and fellow creators to proudly share their sexual orientations and experiences. YouTubers like Hannah Hart, Ingrid Nilsen and singer Troye Sivan garnered a collective 2.8 million views on their coming out videos. Olympic diver Tom Daley came out in a 2013 video, receiving support from his fans and fellow athletes.\n\"People find creators that speak to them, and very often watch them and get to know them and trust them and are influenced by them in a way that no other platform touches,\" says Ben Relles, former head of comedy at YouTube and cofounder of the YouTube channel Barely Political. The way we present ourselves differs between coworkers, family, friends and strangers, but YouTube circumvented those social links. LGBTQ+ creators leveraged the relationships \u00a0with their audiences to make it plain that people with different sexual identities did not just exist, they were no different than every other person.\n\"Through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the internet, social media has given people a unique ability to find safe and welcoming online communities \u2013 especially when they don\u2019t feel accepted in their in-person ones,\" Eisenstein says.\n\"This is for my 12-year-old self,\" begins Australian YouTuber Essena O'Neill in what she called her last ever YouTube video in 2015. Over the next 17 minutes, O'Neill broke down her decision to quit all social media and made a passionate plea to her followers to do the same. O'Neill's story took aim at the \"contrived\" reality of video and social media production, and its harmful effects on mental health. It was a sign of things to come.\n\"Running a channel is very much like running a treadmill,\" says Matt Koval, a filmmaker and YouTube's former head creator liaison. \"If you stop, if you get off the treadmill for a long period of time, your viewers are going to move on and start watching other people just by nature, and it can be difficult to come back.\" And many creators, even as far back as YouTube's early days, never did.\nQuitting videos have become a social media subgenre unto themselves in the past decade \u2013 people in the public eye realising that they've taken on too much, or that they need a break. But O'Neill's departure helped spark a broader conversation.\n\"People are so dismissive of influencers and creators,\" says Duffy. \"What creative workers experience really presages wider trends in the economy.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\nIt wasn't just creators facing burnout online. In the early days, social media was sold as utopian opportunity, a place where people would come together to share ideas beyond the constraints of traditional gatekeepers. But as time went by, a new discussion emerged about social media's potentially addictive qualities and negative effects on our time, attention and mental health.\nThanks in part to a push from creators like O'Neill, who offered their own experience as a model, conversations about our own relationships to the internet began to shift. Ten years later, we've reached the point the point that officials describe social media as a full on public health crisis \u2013 but that shift in thinking hasn't been enough to keep people off the internet. Social media usage on YouTube and elsewhere is higher than ever, and these days, O'Neill herself is back online.\nA spokesperson for Google, YouTube's parent company, says the platform works hard to ensure it's providing a healthy and fulfilling network, both for creators and users who just come to watch. \"Each YouTube creator has a different definition of success, and we have support mechanisms in place and continue to build a community that allows creators to thrive based on their individual needs and business aspirations,\" the spokesperson says. \"We want creators to make their videos in a healthy, sustainable way, and creating engaging content should always take priority over producing a certain quantity of videos.\" YouTube has invested in a number of efforts to promote mental health among its users and across the globe.\nMore people than ever were watching YouTube videos in the 2010s, with the site averaging one billion users a month by 2013, according to the company. But as YouTubers became more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, some of those feelings turned towards the platform itself.\nFor years, YouTube released an annual recap video looking back at the service's biggest cultural trends. What began as a one-and-a-half-minute round-up turned into big budget productions, bringing together a growing roster of notable creators and celebrities recreating viral moments set to remixed tracks of hit songs. It was a fairly well-received \u2013 until 2018.\nWithin a week, YouTube Rewind 2018 racked up over 10 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube post of all time. Critics panned the video, including the CEO of YouTube's own daughter, arguing the company was promoting a self-serving view of the platform geared towards its own corporate interests, one that glossed how people were actually using and responding to the service. \"The community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\" reporter Julia Alexander wrote at the time. The speed and scope of the reaction was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\"For a long time, YouTube has been pretty tolerant of its creators' and audiences' criticisms. I think that's the sort of atmosphere where it's totally permissible for the audience to get really mad at the company,\" says Bergen. But \"the company has never been great at reading the room\".\nDespite the criticism, YouTube maintains that it's an inclusive space built to allow its community to thrive and feel empowered. \"YouTube has not only democratized content, but democratized opportunity,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"At YouTube, we developed a comprehensive approach aimed to ensure we\u2019re a video streaming platform for high-quality content.\" That includes a set of robust community guidelines, the spokesperson says, one the company works to apply equally to all users in order to combat the spread of harmful content and build a healthy environment that lets users flourish.\nRewind 2018 revealed a festering hostility that grew in the online space. \"There was a marked shift,\" Duffy says. In the earliest days, discussions about YouTube centered around the idea that it promoted a culture of positivity. YouTube's original slogan was \"Broadcast Yourself\" \u2013 creators and users saw the website as a project they were all working on together. But as time wore on, an adversarial tone erupted on the platform, Duffy says, and many started to feel the YouTube they helped build had become too powerful.\nThe biggest change, perhaps, was how people understood the role they played on the platform; once they were creating YouTube, but now, they were just using it.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Cinematographer Lol Crawley has had a front row view of the evolution of the entertainment industry over a career spanning more than 25 years.\nFrom listening to Bob Dylan \"on a Welsh hillside\" and studying A-level photography, to shooting some of the most iconic landscapes in modern film.\nHis much-acclaimed latest film, The Brutalist, is about a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the US.\nAnd as he prepares to attend his first Oscars as a nominee, Crawley looks back on his \"formative\" years in Wales with fondness.\nHe was born in Shrewsbury and grew up Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain, Powys, and loved watching films with his father.\n\"I remember insisting he woke me up to watch An American Werewolf in London. I was probably a bit too young for it\u2026 but I really wanted to see a horror movie,\" he recalled.\nThe launch of Channel 4, and in particular, a series called Road Dreams about road trips across America, was also \"really influential\".\nLike many Welsh children, he was exposed to a lot of music and really connected with it.\n\"For me, there's a really big crossover between music and film. When I'm operating a handheld camera, there's a kind of rhythm and a partnership with the performer,\" he said.\nHe continued: \"There's a real beauty and a gentleness to the landscape [in Wales] and I'm drawn to landscapes.\"\nCrawley finished audio visual (AV) studies at college in Wrexham, followed by media production at university, before moving to Los Angeles in 2019. \nHis first film was The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, starring Hugh Grant and shot in Wales, a few miles from where he grew up.\nA cinematographer, also known as the director of photography, is in charge of the look of the film, Crawley explained.\nThey work closely with the director and across the grip department, the lighting department and the camera department.\n\"Each day, we'll have a certain number of scenes that we really have to make,\" he said.\nThe Brutalist - the story of a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the US, directed by Brady Corbet and starring Adrien Brody, Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce - was filmed in Budapest over 33 days on a budget of about $10m.\n\"[It] sounds like a lot, but considering how big the film is in scope, and how long it is, it's a fairly modest schedule and budget,\" he said. \nEach day, the actors would spend time with the director on set as Crawley sat quietly in the corner, working out how best to shoot scenes.\n\"It's about movement of the actors and the camera, what is the focal length, how many shots do we need to tell this part of the story, and how am I going to light it,\" he said. \nHe said the least amount of time he had spent shooting was 21 days on Vox Lux - a film with Natalie Portman set in New York.\n\"The longest was probably 80 days or something, Mandela in South Africa,\" he added.\n\"So it does vary, but 33 days for this movie was very ambitious.\"\nBut, he said, budget did not determine success, as The Brutalist had proven.\nCrawley himself has already been awarded a Silver Frog at Polish cinematography festival Camerimage, won an award at the British Society of Cinematographers, scooped the Robby M\u00fcller Award in Rotterdam, and picked up the BAFTA for best cinematography - not to mention the film's host of other recognitions.\n\"If it's a well-written story, well executed and if the performances are as fine as this, you can make a movie for a million dollars,\" he said.\nHe said audiences \"living in troubling times in America\" connect with the film's themes such as \"abuse of power, art versus commerce, antiquity versus modernity\".\n\"You look at the statue of liberty at the beginning of the movie and it's upended, it's untethered... the statue of liberty is supposed to represent the very best of what America can be in terms of providing a safe haven and a new life for people,\" he said. \n\"We're betraying that at the moment, in my opinion.\"\nHe added it was \"unapologetic event cinema\", at three-and-a-half hours long, and shot on film.\nHe said there was still \"a long way to go\", but he felt there had been big improvements on film sets.\n\"Thankfully there are far more female camera technicians and cinematographers working now than there were and attitudes on set have become a lot better, behaviour on set has become better,\" he said.\nHe said the story and the people were the biggest factors in picking a project, particularly when spending a minimum of three months away from his LA home, where he lives with his wife, film and TV producer Annie Marter.\nThough he regularly rubs shoulders with A-list talent, he is not immune to being star-struck.\n\"I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan and I have been since I was like 10 years old, growing up on this hillside in Wales listening to the albums my dad had. I've worked with him twice now and each time I'm in awe and just find myself staring at him,\" he said.\n\"And I went to the [Oscars] nominees dinner, and it's like 'hello Ralph Fiennes, hello Kate Blanchett' and this is pretty wild.\"\nOn his bucket list is a sci-fi or space film, \"as long as it's an exploration of the human mind at the same time\" and not \"spectacle cinema for the hell of it\".\nAs for returning to Wales, he has ventured over to show his wife where he grew up and reunite with friends, but would \"like to get back more, for sure\".\n\"It would be remarkable to come back and film something in Wales, and there's a thriving film industry as well now.  So who knows?\"\nFor now, he plans to \"embrace\" the \"rollercoaster\" of the Oscars.",

That's what I feel. There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. He was born in north-east London to a father who ran a sweet shop and a mother who was a secretary. \"That's what I wanted. That's what I thought I could do. That's what I enjoyed.\"\nEnjoying the spotlight was just a part of his success. Sir Derek notes that after he found himself at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (which he affectionately calls the Rep) in 1960, there wasn't anything else that matched the euphoria of basking in an audience's applause. It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped for. Like most, they'd expected their son to go into a field with stability, like accounting or insurance.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"I always thought\u2026 I wanted to be an actor. I had no talent for anything else,\" he says. \"Hamlet confirmed it.\" After reciting one of the doomed prince's monologues to Kay, Sir Derek admits that most of his roles have disappeared into the ether, but the work of the Bard has stayed with him since those early performances almost 70 years ago. \"All the other parts have gone. Hamlet's still around. Shakespeare stays.\"\nSir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens. But he's as quick to note that he didn't have the classical training many of them had. He tells Kay that it was a bit of luck that led to his successes, which include being knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II and earning the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\"I think there's talent and I think there's luck. Without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own,\" he says. \"You've got to have the opportunity to show you've got talent. Without that opportunity\u2026 nobody's seeing it.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\u00a0\nAnother obstacle Jacobi notes was the fact that he was never seen as classically handsome. \"They had a head start because they were nice to look at,\" he says of Stephens and Olivier, while he credits being able to hone his craft in front of an audience from the age of 17 as what set him apart. He tells Kay that luck landed him that first job and his time at the Rep stood in for drama school. \"It was a huge learning experience.\"\nAnd although Sir Derek says he hasn't stopped learning, he works at a different pace now, and has learned to find new ways of working.\n\"You slow down,\" the 86-year-old says. \"It's more difficult to remember lines. I used to have a very sharp brain. I don't anymore. That, obviously, is age.\" These days, he has some help with those lines via an earpiece just in case, with Kay likening it to a skier using a knee brace.\u00a0\n\"I've really had a charmed life,\" Sir Derek says, reflecting on his career, his long-time husband, theatre director Richard Clifford, and the fact that he can still do what he loves. Sir Derek's upcoming projects include appearances in episodes of Doctor Who Unbound and Good Omens as well as films The Vampyre: Blood & Ink, with Malcolm McDowell and action-comedy Tinsel Town, alongside Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\"I can't complain about anything in my life.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. \nMs McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \n\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. \nThe impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.\nBut analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.\nChina has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.  \nTrump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.

I knew I was not Messi or anyone, I was Bojan. \n\"But when people demand for you to be at that level, it is difficult to live with that expectation.  \n\"It was difficult to find a way.\"\nEuro Leagues: An interview with Bojan, & the Magic of the Cup\nBojan's career appeared to be skyrocketing. \nIn February 2008, only a few months after making his first-team debut at Barcelona, he was called up by Spain to play in a friendly against France.\nBut his international debut was delayed as he withdrew, and then declined an invitation to be part of the Spain squad for Euro 2008 - a tournament they went on to win.\nIllness and personal reasons were cited at the time for him pulling out of both but a decade later, Bojan says he was suffering from anxiety issues.\n\"As a football player the people do not know what is behind the football bit,\" he added.\n\"In the moment I suffered a lot but at the same point I knew it was something that was making me strong. \n\"At the end of my career I wanted to tell my story, but not as Bojan the footballer but Bojan the human, because I know this is a story that can not only help football people but also in general. \n\"As soon as I told my story I felt I closed all the experiences.\"\nBojan played for Stoke between 2014 and 2019\nBojan had three more seasons at Barcelona, but he struggled to match those early expectations and had spells away from the club with Roma, AC Milan and Ajax.\nBut in 2014 he decided to sever ties completely with Barcelona and opted to pursue the opportunity of playing in the Premier League by signing permanently for Stoke.\n\"It was one of the first big decisions I made in my career,\" Bojan said. \"It was to cut the umbilical cord with Barcelona after 12 years. \n\"I decided to do it because I knew it was the right decision, but in the moment it was hurting me a lot.\"\nHowever, the anxiety issues that Bojan had been struggling with became so difficult that he was unable to fly out to join up with Stoke, despite having boarded the plane to leave Spain.\n\"The plane was going to the sky but I was feeling 'wow, I cannot fly' and that is why I stopped the plane,\" he said.\nBojan returned home but was able to fly the following day and linked up with the Stoke squad at a training camp in Germany.\nAt the Potters he made 53 appearances in the Premier League, scoring 14 goals, and it is a move that he credits as one of the best of his career.\n\"For me, Stoke gave me a big opportunity to play for them and in the Premier League,\" he said.\n\"We built one of the biggest moments in Stoke's story. The fans and the players will always be in my heart and I've always said my top level in my career I did with them.\"\nBojan may not have been the next Messi but he was forging an impressive career at Stoke, with his form leading to links with moves to Liverpool and Manchester United.\nBut a serious knee injury in January 2015 disrupted his progress and he was never the same again. Spells at Mainz and Alaves followed before he finished his career in Japan, retiring in 2022.\nThe following year he returned to Barcelona, taking on the football co-ordinator role, and while he may only be a couple of years older than some of those in the current first-team, he is enjoying his new life off the pitch.\n\"I don't miss playing football,\" he said. \n\"I feel that was the end of a chapter in my life, I felt proud about what I did and what I learned from the good and the bad experiences. \n\"I see the players now when they are training and playing and I feel already I did this, and now I am on another step and looking forward.\"\nListen to the full interview with Bojan Krkic on the Euro Leagues podcast on BBC Sounds.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources, Trump has said. \nZelensky has described the bilateral deal as preliminary, and said he wants further agreements which include US security guarantees to deter renewed Russian aggression. \nBut Trump said the US would not provide guarantees \"beyond... very much\", saying the responsibility should instead fall to Europe.\nTrump also seemingly ruled out the prospect of Ukraine becoming a Nato member - one of Zelensky's long-held ambitions. \nSpeaking at a meeting of his cabinet on Wednesday, Trump said the presence of American workers extracting rare earth metals on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\" for Ukraine. \nHe said Kyiv should \"forget about\" joining Nato and repeated Russia's claims that the issue was one of the driving factors behind the war. \nThe US president suggested a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia was not far off, telling reporters: \"We're going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people.\"\nBut Zelensky said without security guarantees \"we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing\". \n\"I want to find a Nato path or something similar,\" he said.\n\nRussia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nIn 2008, the alliance had said that Ukraine could eventually join.\nTrump has suggested European peacekeeping troops could be stationed in Ukraine as part of a ceasefire deal, but Russia says it is against this. \nEuropean representatives, however, were not included in Washington's initial talks with Russia.\nSpeaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said \"for any kind of deal to work on European soil, you need the Europeans to also agree to it\".\nShe said the mineral resources deal was up to Ukraine, but any peace agreement would \"need the Europeans on board\".\nMs Kallas' scheduled meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday was abruptly cancelled, with both sides citing scheduling issues.\nZelensky said the success of the minerals deal, which was formally backed by his government on Wednesday evening, would depend on the outcome of his meeting with Trump this week.\nKey details have not yet been made public, but Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said it envisages an \"investment fund\" for Ukraine's reconstruction.\nThe prospect of a deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nBut disagreements over its substance exacerbated tensions between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks. \nThe Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports suggest this demand has now been dropped.\nThere are also differences in how both sides are now describing the deal. Trump has lauded the \"very big agreement\" as an opportunity for the US to get its \"money back\" after funding aid to Ukraine. \nBut Zelensky has instead referred to it as a \"framework agreement\" upon which he hopes further deals can be made.\nTrump has said he wants a quick end to the war in Ukraine and has sought to reset relations with Russia. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two leaders sent delegations to Saudi Arabia in bilateral talks which excluded Ukraine. \nIn response, Zelensky accused the US of helping Putin \"break out of years of isolation\" and Trump of living in a \"Russian disinformation space\". \nUkraine is a country rich in natural resources. Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are there. But accessing some of these resources will not be completely straightforward. \nSome of the mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that Ukraine first needs to addresses its problem with unexploded mines before striking a deal with the US.\nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nPutin has also said he is open to offering the US access to rare minerals, including from Russian-occupied Ukraine.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will also be meeting both Trump and Zelensky separately this week to discuss the war in Ukraine.\nHe is due to arrive in Washington later on Wednesday.",

In the end of the game he was there, then he went home, so there's not an issue there.\n\"But I told them that in Manchester United everything is important, and the perception in a big club is really important, so he's going to pay a dinner to all the team, and that's it.\n\"I think he understands. He was subbed, he was playing well and has to go off in that moment of the game. It's hard to deal with everything but they have to deal with everything. I just try to help them be better footballers.\"\nUnited face Fulham in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nGarnacho, who Amorim said has a \"knock\", is expected to be fit for the tie.\nThe Portuguese coach was also asked about comments from former United skipper Roy Keane following the Irishman's furious rant about Bruno Fernandes' role as captain.\n\"I have a different opinion,\" said Amorim. \n\"I know sometimes he does things with his arms but most of all, a lot is out of frustration for this year and last. He wants to win.\n\"Roy Keane had big standards. It is normal to have opinions. I have an opposite opinion and I think my opinion is more important because I am the coach.\"\nBONUS: The Harry Maguire interview\nThis video can not be played\n'We have great belief in Ruben's tactics' - Maguire\nFormer United captain Harry Maguire also praised his successor Fernandes.\nEngland defender Maguire, who scored the winner in midweek against Ipswich, led the side from January 2020 until July 2023 when Erik ten Hag replaced him with the Portuguese midfielder.\n\"Me and Bruno have a great relationship,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"When I was captain he supported me so much and I trust him so much and I'm sure he trusts me now he is captain. \n\"We both see ourselves as leaders. When I was captain I saw him as a leader in his own right and trusted his opinion and I'm sure it's the same with him now. He is a fantastic player and a great lad to have in the dressing room.\n\"We have a lot of leaders.

He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant.\u00a0Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare.\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right \u2013 she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\u00a0\nThe playwright\u00a0never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\u00a0\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\u00a0\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady\n\u2022\u00a0The historic female gang who menaced London\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her\u00a02011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s\u00a0that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\u00a0\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest.\u00a0\"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\u00a0\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" \u2013 one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\u00a0\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a 14th-Century royal crisis?3 days agoShareSaveNick LevineShareSaveAlamyA new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.This week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Was Edward II gay?Ever since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". \"The actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC.",

        "article_text": "JD Vance's remarkable dressing down of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday showed the US vice-president unafraid to take centre stage as an attack dog, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy.\nIt was Vance who led the attack on Zelensky before Donald Trump joined the fray at the White House in a meeting that had been cordial until the vice-president spoke up to laud the president for seeking what he described as a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\" said Zelensky, who has been critical of direct talks between Washington and Moscow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded, tearing into the stunned Ukrainian leader.\n\"Mr President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\nHe also accused Zelensky of having campaigned on behalf of Democrats during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a munitions factory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met Trump's rival, Kamala Harris, at the White House.\nVance's upbraiding of Zelensky drew broad support among Republicans.\n\"I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country,\" said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy hawk. He suggested Zelensky should resign.\nAlabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as \"that Ukrainian weasel\".\nCongressman Mike Lawyer of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was \"a missed opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine\".\nVance's remarkable attack on a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president.\nTheir job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency.\nThe contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater.\nBut Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly sceptical of US aid to Ukraine.\nWhen he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: \"I've got to be honest with you. I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\"\nThe vice-president derided Trump as an idiot eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement.\nDespite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was \"too early\" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028.\nUndeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political brawler for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken criticism of the administration's foes.\nOne common thread is that many victims of Vance's tongue-lashing are America's allies.\nIt began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there.\nBut Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.\n\"If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,\" he said.\nThe audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified.\nThis was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.\nThis was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.\nNot for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.\nHis speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.\nYet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.\nVance accused him of \"moralistic garbage\", \"historical illiteracy\" and - worst of all - of being a \"globalist\".\nAnd if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.\nOut of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\".\nThe prime minister pushed back firmly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\u2026 We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\".\nThis was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.\nThe aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.\nSeveral questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe?\nWhite House sources have told US papers it was not.\nIs Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents?\nOr is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?\nWhatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.",

        "article_text": "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.\nThese are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.\nThen there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.\n\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.\nNorth Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.\nSince then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.\nBut after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.\nLast Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.\nAmong them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.\nBen Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.\n\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"\nDespite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"\nOn his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.\nFor now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.\nSet up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.\nJoe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.\nJoe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.\n\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"\nBut according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.\nCovid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.\nIt is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.\nLocal guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.\nEven Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"\nThe regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.\n\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.\nOne of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.\nThey knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"\nSuch conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.\nMike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"\nFor Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"\nBut tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.\n\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.\nOne conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "Barry Ferguson suffered defeat in his home debut as Rangers head coach\n\"It's not good enough.\" \nNot the words Rangers interim head coach Barry Ferguson might have expected to be saying in the aftermath of his return to Ibrox, this time in charge, after the departure of Philippe Clement.\nOff the back of a rousing 4-2 fightback win at Kilmarnock in his first outing, this was set up to be a positive homecoming, during which captain James Tavernier made his 500th appearance for the club.\nYou could feel that pre-match. Like a weight had been lifted. Yet it went horribly wrong - again. \nMotherwell win to ruin Ferguson's Ibrox return\nCeltic thump five past St Mirren to extend Premiership lead\nRangers stumbled to a third straight defeat at Ibrox. Queens Park, St Mirren and now Motherwell, by 2-1, all victorious. Unthinkable and certainly unpalatable for the Rangers support as they, once again, demonstrated at full-time. \nAt least the minority that remained at Ibrox come that point. Certainly \"not good enough\".\nRangers are now 16 points behind Celtic with nine games remaining. They have either lost or drawn almost 38% of their league fixtures. \nFerguson looked increasingly agonised by a tepid, lacklustre display during which Motherwell took full advantage to earn a fantastic win, just their second in 61 league meetings between these sides.\nIt would be incredibly harsh to lay blame at Ferguson's feet, but the short-lived honeymoon seems over already. \nThe former Rangers captain has some serious issues to address - and quickly - as this squad looks increasingly unreliable, domestically at least.\n\"There's obviously a clear problem in terms of playing at home and that's something me as a manager and my staff and the players need to sit down and really get to the bottom of,\" Ferguson said.\nWorryingly for him, Ibrox was the one source of solace for much of this season as domestic away form deserted Rangers under Clement until late in his tenure. That home comfort has now imploded. \nSo what is the issue? \n\"There's good players here, I've seen it,\" Ferguson continued. \"Technically, very good. To play at Rangers, they need to be mentally strong. The fans demand that of you.\"\nOn this evidence, the mentality has been shredded. Experienced goalkeeper Jack Butland was culpable for the opener with a poor reaction save to allow Luke Armstrong to net the opener. His confidence looks diminished, as it does in many of his team-mates.\nThey were brutally exposed by some fine play from Motherwell for the second. \nMore concerning for Ferguson was the lack of energy throughout. It rarely felt that Rangers would go on and mount a winning comeback. \nThey cannot possibly win silverware, other than in Europe, where they face a stiff last 16 first-leg test away to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbache on Thursday. \nWill the Europa League version of this Jekyll and Hyde Rangers turn up again?\n\"Well, that's what happens when you play at Rangers,\" Ferguson explained.\n\"European football's great. It's great to be involved in. It's great financially for the club, but your bread and butter is domestic trophies. \n\"Domestically, the form has to be better. Europe's always been a bonus. It's brilliant to go and pit your wits against really good teams and really good managers and really good players, but what matters? Domestic football for me.\"\nRangers will hope that bonus of European form continues as their domestic season lies in tatters.\nIt was another painful home defeat for the home supporters, who must have hoped the familiar face of Ferguson in charge would bring short-term relief and steady the ship. It has not.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed.

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me.

        "summary": "In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.Kross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.What are the most common misconceptions about emotions?One big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.Listening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised \u2013 Ethan KrossBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?So how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?Listening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.Many people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.Sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem \u2013 Ethan KrossBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both.",

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport's female pioneers.\nIn 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLast October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted.\n\"I think it's sad that it took so long, but I think it's fantastic that we're in a different place now,\" Carter says.\nOctober's ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together.\n\"There was a camaraderie that was built in '96,\" Carter says. \"We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we'd never been away from each other.\"\nGreat Britain's players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts.\n\"I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,\" McIntosh says. \"Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me.\"\nBut there's one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find.\nGreat Britain's team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing\nBritain's players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series.\nIn that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield.\nThree years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn't turned up.\n\"We thought we'd brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,\" McIntosh says. \"But it's not.\"\nThe mystery remains unresolved. \"Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,\" Sheldon says. \"I've got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield.\"\nIf anyone does have it, they're sitting on a piece of history. \n\"It's in somebody's attic, because I can't see where else it would have gone,\" Carter says. \"So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!\"",

As part of the scheme, Teddy's tubs were first taken to the Shamblehurst Barn pub before being moved to a plastic reprocessing centre.The pub's general manager Kieron O'Donnell said: \"Huge congratulations to Teddy on collecting over 2,500 tubs for Greene King's Tub2Pub campaign this year. \"Teddy, whose hero is David Attenborough, previously told the BBC he was \"angry\" when he found out that the containers could not be recycled in his family's normal recycling bin.Some authorities in the UK have the capacity to recycle the tubs via kerbside collection but Hampshire currently does not.Teddy set about collecting the tubs from people's houses and bins and wrote a letter to his school, which in turn wrote to parents.With help from his mum Laura, he put up posters at local businesses and got his grandad to go to the local tip to ask them to save any tubs that people had binned.A post from Teddy on Facebook, in which he described himself as an \"eco warrior on a mission\" and telling of how \"hundreds of thousands of [tubs] go to landfill or the ocean\", helped gather further momentum. \"Everyone can make a difference, it doesn't matter how small you are,\" said Teddy, as the bench was unveiled.A plaque on the purple seat reads: \"With thanks to Teddy for your outstanding efforts contributing to Tub2Pub 2025 from Greene King, co-cre8, DCW Polymers and Macmillan Cancer Support.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'It's all boiling over' - Cunha sees red for violent conduct\nAn FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Bournemouth was a disappointing blow for Wolves, but the impact of losing star forward Matheus Cunha for at least three Premier League matches may hurt even more.\nThe 25-year-old had to be dragged down the tunnel and was unable to take part in the penalty shootout following his red card in the final minute of extra time for an unsavoury clash with Cherries defender Milos Kerkez. \nWolves boss Vitor Pereira said: \"Of course, the emotional side was very high and not only inside the pitch, but on the bench and in the stands, a lot of pressure everywhere. In the end it happens.\n\"It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football.\"\nBoth Matt Doherty and Boubacar Traore missed spot-kicks for Wolves in the 5-4 shootout defeat after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes at Vitality Stadium.\nIt was a dramatic climax to a game where Evanilson had put the Cherries ahead on his return from injury, before his fellow Brazilian Cunha levelled with a sensational equaliser from around 30 yards.\nHowever, Cunha's display went from magical to madness with a dismissal that will leave his side - fourth bottom in the Premier League - without their best player for crucial games in their relegation fight.\nThe red-mist moment, where he clashed multiple times with Kerkez, including fighting, kicking out at the Hungarian full-back while he was on the ground and aiming a headbutt when Kerkez had got back to his feet.\nAfter being pulled away by team-mates, referee Sam Barrott eventually gave him a red card but a furious Cunha refused to leave the field, needing to be escorted and pushed down the tunnel. \nHe will be suspended for three games following the red card for violent conduct, but additional games cannot be ruled out because of the severity of the incident and having already served a two-match ban for clashing with Ipswich Town security in December.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Match of the Day: \"The ability he has is top level, the goal he scored belongs in the Champions League, but then suddenly we see the ugly.\n\"I have not seen that on the football pitch since the 1970s - he just lost it. The referee had to send him off. They couldn't get him out of the ground. This was the ugly part and it is something he has to stop.\n\"Wolves need points to stay up. He will be a huge loss.\"\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?\nWolves have what could be described as a favourable run of fixtures coming up against teams in the bottom half of the Premier League. \nBut Cunha is certain to miss matches against Everton, bottom club Southampton and West Ham, while third-bottom Ipswich follow on 5 April.\nWolves have built a five-point buffer over Ipswich and Leicester City after winning two of their past four league matches.\nBut losing talisman Cunha will be a massive blow, given he is their top league scorer on 13 goals and their attacking inspiration in this troubled campaign.\nCunha was sent off in the 120th minute of the match in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vitality Stadium\nCunha has been linked with a big-money move over the past year with Europe's top clubs keen, but he may be viewed as a loose cannon because of his antics.\nAs well as his aggressive display at Bournemouth, in an unsavoury incident at Ipswich earlier in the season, Cunha elbowed a member of the Portman Road staff before snatching his glasses off his face.\nThe Brazil forward is known to have a \u00a362.5m release clause in place which may also put off suitors looking to secure a summer transfer.\nWolves boss Pereira told BBC Match of the Day: \"When the situation happened I was looking for the ball.\n\"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today. Not only inside the pitch, but outside [the pitch]. With a lot of pressure, and in the end these are things that can happen.\n\"You know now he is frustrated, he is better in my opinion. I never speak to the team when we are nervous or frustrated. It is better to wait one day and think about everything. After we can have a talk.\n\"Of course, he is an important player, but next game we play with 11 and start with 11.\"\nSpeaking in his post-match news conference, he added: \"Matheus is a special player and today he played extra time. The last three weeks he has a problem in the hamstring and he tried.\n\"I didn't see the situation. Don't ask me about it because I was looking at the other end. In the end the referee decided the red card.\"\nAsked about whether Cunha deserves another chance, Pereira added: \"Of course, he is important but I cannot speak about what I don't know. It is important to check the situation, to look for what happened because I was looking for the other side.\n\"The others say to me he kick, he punch, he do what he did with the head and the player went to hospital? No, OK. But it is a situation that cannot happen of course.\n\"To judge the situation, I must have the clear image in my mind.\"\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola criticised the decision to show Kerkez a yellow card in the Cunha clash. It was was the defender's second in this season's FA Cup and means he will be banned from playing in the quarter-final tie.\n\"Milos Kerkez has received a yellow card for adopting an aggressive attitude,\" said Iraola. \"After what they have done to Milos Kerkez, they should reward him because [of] the attitude he has.\n\"They punch him, they kick him on the floor, they headbutt him and he doesn't react! You punish this? I will have to say to Milos [that] probably I cannot do as well as a player.\n\"The prize is they show him a yellow card and he will not play the quarter-final. Yes, I am very disappointed with the refereeing.\"\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\nGet Wolves news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.\nA man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"\n\"England.\"\n\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.\n\"Do you?\" I ask.\n\"A lot better than where I was before.\"\nWelcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.\nConcrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.\nThe UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.\nLooking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.\nJust one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.\nNo prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.\nJimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.\nHe's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.\n\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"\nDelgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.\nThe \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.\nCredits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.\nOff the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.\n\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"\nThe rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).\nThe BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.\n\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"\nShe believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"\nThe Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.\n\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"\nWhat would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"\nAs well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.\nMore people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.\nEven so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.\n\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.\nIt's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.\n\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.\nBut not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.\nSamantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.\n\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"\nIt's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?\nThe challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

Even now Sarah says she can feel out of place in the music industry.\n\"The music industry is so based on genre, and sometimes I've felt like people look at me and they're like, 'oh, you can't really work on this or that'.\n\"I've definitely really struggled with it. It's been really hard.\"\nThe latest diversity report by UK Music recorded that in 2024, 7.6% of people working in the music industry identified as Asian. \nThe group represents all sectors of the industry and noted there had been \"positive movement in the right direction\", with people from minority backgrounds now representing more than 25% of the workforce - up from 15.6% when the survey started in 2016. \n\"Nonetheless barriers still exist and we must continue to seek change,\" the report said.\n\"There is a lot of misunderstanding and lack of acknowledgement sometimes,\" Sarah says. \nAnd a lack of acknowledgement is something she'd like to address not just for British Asians, but the people working behind the scenes in the music industry too.\nLola Young is up for best pop act at Saturday's Brit Awards and, until 2019, music videos had a chance to be nominated for prizes too.\nThat award, British Video of the Year, no longer exists - it was last won by Little Mix for their Woman Like Me video. \nOther big awards like the Grammys still make a point of celebrating music videos and even go one step further with an award for best recording package, which goes to the artistic director behind a project.\nThis year it was won by Charli XCX and her creative director Imogene Strauss for Brat, which took on a life of its own - even being named Collins Dictionary 2024 word of the year. \n\"That's such a special moment because that campaign and the creative behind it is incredible,\" Sarah says.\nShe'd like to see would like to see similar opportunities for recognition at the Brits. \n\"It would be nice to have that kind of recognition, just because it is such a big production.\n\"There's so many parts to a campaign, it's so multifaceted.\"\nThe Brit Awards have not yet responded to Newsbeat's request for comment.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

In the process, the suspect is also thought to have lost blood.\nThe attacker is still at large. \n\"It's quite a frustrating case,\" says Jo Ward, crime scene coordinator at West Midlands Police, \"because I don't actually think I've had a case that has not been solved in my 27 years, so it doesn't sit right with me.\"\nJo has dealt with more than 50 murders, and is determined to track down the killer of her only unsolved case - an investigation featured in the new BBC series of Forensics: The Real CSI.\nOn 9 February 2022, Jo was called to investigate the murder of a Chinese national, Jinming Zhang, 41, in a flat in Digbeth, Birmingham.\nIt quickly became apparent that the flat was being used as a brothel and the only witness to the brutal murder was a young Chinese woman who had hid from the killer. \nOriginally the motive was thought to have been robbery - drawers on a bedside table had been pulled out and the property searched. But this could not be confirmed.\nAs crime scene coordinator, Jo was first on the scene, combing the property for evidence. Throughout the investigation, she worked alongside other specialists, such as blood pattern analysts and CCTV coordinators to try to piece together everything that happened that night.\nPolice believe the murder suspect may have sustained a hand injury in the frenzied attack.\nBlood pattern analysis, a technique used to interpret the bloodstains at the crime scene, helped to determine which of the blood spots in the flat may have belonged to the victim and which could have been the killer's.\nA blood trail was detected leading away from the property, and hours of CCTV footage was analysed to track the killer's escape route.\nThe suspect was a black man, between 5ft 2in (1.6m) and 5ft 5in (1.7m) tall and of slim build. CCTV also revealed he had an unusual way of walking.\nAlthough a DNA sample of the suspect was found, there were no matches on the national DNA database - which holds the DNA profiles of about 5.9 million people who have been arrested and cautioned, or convicted of a crime.\nThe case is still ongoing and no-one has yet been charged with the murder.\nThis would have been the end of the road 10 years ago, says Jo, but developments in forensics have meant familial DNA searches could also be used to try to identify potential biological relatives of the suspect who might also be on the national database.\n\"In the 27 years I've been in [the police], I've never carried out that kind of search before,\" says Jo.\nThe use of familial DNA search is not the only advancement in forensics, says Jo, the sample size needed to get a full DNA profile has also changed dramatically.\n\"Years ago we used to have to have quite a large amount of blood, or any other cellular material, to then actually get a DNA profile from it,\" she says. \"Nowadays, we literally need a pinprick size amount of blood or any other cellular material to be able to get a full profile.\"\nPreviously, as well as blood, the main DNA sources would have been cigarettes. But now, anything that has been in contact with the lips and saliva can also be swabbed to provide a DNA profile, says Jo, such as cans, bottles of drinks and, increasingly, vapes. \nCellular DNA can also be found when someone has simply touched an item, says Jo.\n\"Obviously when we have murders or sexual assaults, we're always looking at [whether] the item of clothing [has] been gripped by the offender at all during the assault. It's about targeting those areas to then see if you can obtain the DNA from that.\"\nBut while techniques have improved, getting answers is not always as fast as Jo would like.\n\"It's not like your CSI Miami,\" says Jo, \"where they get a DNA and literally within an hour they get results.\"\nShe is hopeful the identification process will speed up in the future.\n\"Obviously fingerprints have always been around and we recover them with powder and send them in,\" says Jo. \"I think digitally there will be something that comes up in the future where it's a simple, take a photo, scan straightway, and it'll be a quicker turnaround on identification.\"\nWalking into so many murder scenes over the years has had an impact on Jo. She gets the same feelings of apprehension approaching every scene, with butterflies in her stomach.\n\"Sometimes I feel sick after I've come out and not wanting to eat, but I've really got a mindset now where I think: 'Ok I can't change what's happened but what I can do is my utmost to then identify the person responsible and get justice for the victim and the family.'\"\nJo suffered with PTSD after a murder investigation in the past, which she says taught her a lot. To avoid a recurrence, she tries not to get emotionally attached.\n\"I think that's the mistake I made when I had my PTSD, that I was looking at all the family photographs,\" says Jo.\n\"It's a tough job but it's also a very rewarding job when you get that result and you identify the suspect and they get charged.\"\nWhen it comes to her only unsolved case, Jo is hoping someone will come forward after watching the programme and remember something that could lead to the identification of the suspect.\nShe also has a message for the killer: \"We need to get justice for the victim and the family. Do the right thing and come forward.\"\nForensics: The Real CSI - Murder in a Brothel is on Sunday 2 March at 21:00 GMT on BBC Two and from 06:00 GMT on BBC iPlayer\nDetails of help and support for victims of crime are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",

If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would haven't been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport's female pioneers.\nIn 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLast October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted.\n\"I think it's sad that it took so long, but I think it's fantastic that we're in a different place now,\" Carter says.\nOctober's ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together.\n\"There was a camaraderie that was built in '96,\" Carter says. \"We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we'd never been away from each other.\"\nGreat Britain's players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts.\n\"I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,\" McIntosh says. \"Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me.\"\nBut there's one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find.\nGreat Britain's team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing\nBritain's players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series.\nIn that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield.\nThree years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn't turned up.\n\"We thought we'd brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,\" McIntosh says. \"But it's not.\"\nThe mystery remains unresolved. \"Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,\" Sheldon says. \"I've got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield.\"\nIf anyone does have it, they're sitting on a piece of history. \n\"It's in somebody's attic, because I can't see where else it would have gone,\" Carter says. \"So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!\"",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.\nHis sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.\nA tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. \nIf you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.\nOne of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. \nDuring what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nThe exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nIt escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be \"thankful\" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" \nThe Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.\nIn a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" \n\"He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" Trump said.\nAhead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. \nZelensky had said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. \nNotably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nBut Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.\nTrump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. \nA big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \nOn the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for \"a significant reduction\" in their staff by 13 March.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.\nTrump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter the meeting, Macron said Trump had \"good reason\" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. \nTrump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nPart way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nTrump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.\nThe clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the \"riviera\" of the Middle East.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (\u00a3792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. \nOfficials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.\nTrump unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (\u00a33.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\nThe president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to \"high-level people\".\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. \nIt includes $4.5 trillion (\u00a33.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.\nHowever, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.\nTrump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.\n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.",

        "article_text": "Households will need to make significant changes to their lifestyles to help the UK reach net zero by 2050, says the government's independent climate advisers.\nIn its latest advice, known as the carbon budget, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says by 2040, 80% of cars should be electric and one in two homes have a heat pump.\nHere are some of the ways it says you can cut greenhouse gas emissions: \nDecarbonising home heating will be essential if the country is going to reach its legally binding net zero target by 2050.\nOur homes are the second biggest source of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions after transport, and 80% of those emissions are from gas boilers. The proportion has been increasing as the country generates more electricity from low-carbon technologies like renewables and nuclear.\nThe CCC is backing heat pumps as the main replacement for gas boilers and rules out using hydrogen.\nIt says only about 60,000 UK homes installed a heat pump in 2023. It wants that figure to be 450,000 by 2030 and 1.5 million by 2035. \nHowever, it recognises that is going to be difficult. A key problem is heat pumps are typically more expensive than gas boilers, even after the government's \u00a37,500 grant. And because they heat water to a lower temperature than boilers, they work better in well-insulated homes with larger radiators or underfloor heating.\nThe committee says the government needs to consider schemes to help lower income households cover at least some of the costs of these changes.\nThe hope is that as boilers break down, consumers will replace them with heat pumps. The report doesn't recommend a ban on new boilers but says by 2035 all new heating systems should be low carbon.\nA quarter of UK emissions come from transport \u2013 excluding aviation \u2013 making it another priority for carbon cuts. But the CCC is less worried about how these will be achieved.\nThat is because it believes continuing reductions in the cost of batteries and other technologies mean electric cars and vans (EVs) could be cheaper to buy than petrol and diesel vehicles as soon as next year. This is significantly cheaper when you take into account running costs. It believes we will naturally choose them when we're looking for a new car.\nIn 2023, 16% of new cars were fully electric - the government says that will be 55% by 2027 and 95% by 2030.\nThe CCC says government will need to support the rollout of the charging network, and that the cost of charging needs to fall and payment be simplified.\nIt expects the switchover will become increasingly rapid, partly because it believes it will become more difficult to buy petrol and diesel, as it is expected there will be fewer petrol stations by 2040. \nWe are going to need to change our diets, the CCC says. That is because agriculture is the fourth highest emitting sector in the UK economy and nearly two-thirds (63%) of those emissions are from livestock.\nHowever, the CCC is careful not recommend restrictions on what we eat. Instead, it anticipates the current slow drift towards more plant-based foods will continue in the years to come. By 2040 it estimates we will be eating 25% less meat and 20% less dairy.\nMeat products will initially be replaced by existing alternative protein products like plant-based burgers, but in later years it expects us to start eating more \"alternative proteins\".  These include oils and meat grown from animal cells in bio-reactors - fermentation tanks like you might see in a brewery. The first product using these cultivated meats for animal consumption went on sale earlier this month.\nOur changing diets will mean cattle and sheep numbers will need to fall by 27% as a result, it says. That will allow a shift towards woodland creation, the restoration of the country's peatlands and allow more land to be used to grow energy crops.\nUK farmers will need to be supported during this transition, it advises, and the government will need to be careful to ensure that low-carbon UK food is not just replaced by higher-carbon products imported from abroad.\nAviation is currently the sixth biggest source of UK emissions, but by 2040 the CCC reckons it will be the biggest.\nIn the past the committee has advised government there should be no expansion of UK airports without a clear plan to cut emissions from the sector. The government is expected to announce its support for a new runway at Gatwick on Thursday, so is likely to be relieved the CCC has dropped that recommendation from this latest carbon budget.\nBut it says the aviation industry will need to pick up the tab for the costs of decarbonising the sector. That is going to require technological innovation \u2013 more efficient jets and electric planes \u2013 and the increasing use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).\nSAF is made from plant products or by combining captured CO2 with hydrogen. Just 1% of jet fuel is currently SAF, but the CCC expects that to rise to 17% by 2040.\nAny emissions the industry cannot eliminate will need to be offset by what the CCC calls \"engineered removals\". That means using technologies to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it permanently underground.\nAll of which is going to be expensive and will drive up ticket prices. The CCC expects those higher prices will slow down the increase in passenger numbers in years to come. However, it still expects a 28% increase in passenger numbers by 2050 \u2013 with UK residents taking a total of 402 million flights a year.\nIt has a warning though. If all that new tech doesn't cut emissions as much as the industry is expecting, the government may need to impose limits on flight numbers.",

        "article_text": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant.\u00a0Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare.\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right \u2013 she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\u00a0\nThe playwright\u00a0never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\u00a0\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\u00a0\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady\n\u2022\u00a0The historic female gang who menaced London\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her\u00a02011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s\u00a0that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\u00a0\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest.\u00a0\"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\u00a0\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" \u2013 one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\u00a0\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim.

But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.\nHowever, again, there are different figures out there.\nThe European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans. Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.However, again, there are different figures out there.The European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans.",

It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar. They are shortlisted for best animated feature for their latest outing, Vengeance Most Fowl.\nRead more about this year's awards season films:",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy was appointed Leicester boss on 29 November\nBefore Leicester City won the Premier League title in 2016, they pulled off one of the greatest of great escapes to avoid relegation to the Championship.\nA repeat of that looks very unlikely this time - even though their current situation is not as precarious. \nBack in 2014-15 they were rooted to the foot of the table for much of the season, only climbing off it in April as a run of seven wins from their final nine games took them to unexpected safety.\nBut this Leicester team look barely capable of winning one game, let alone going on a run of victories, as Thursday's 2-0 loss to West Ham left them five points adrift of safety.\n\"We are going to get up again,\" vowed boss Ruud van Nistelrooy after the game.\n\"We are still in this fight, mathematically we are there and we keep fighting as long as we can. \n\"It must be clear that the fight was only one half today and that is not enough.\"\nLeicester sacked Steve Cooper on 24 November with the club 16th after 12 league games, but the change has not had anywhere near the impact the Foxes would have hoped - and the statistics make for concerning reading:\nThe Foxes have lost 11 of their past 12 Premier League games (won one).\nIn his 14 games in charge, Van Nistelrooy has picked up just seven points, three fewer than previous boss Cooper managed this season (10 in 12 games).\nNo side has conceded more own-goals in the Premier League this season than Leicester (three, level with West Ham and Wolves).\nLeicester have also failed to score in each of their past four Premier League games, last doing so in February 2017 (a run of six).\nOn Leicester's struggles to score, Van Nistelrooy added: \"If you play like this in the first half you are not going to score. We were not even close to scoring. \n\"In the second half we were much closer to score. At least you give yourself an opportunity.\"\nIn Leicester's favour, however, is time. \nA five-point deficit is not insurmountable and they have 11 league games left - that's 33 points to play for.\nBut their upcoming run of fixtures looks tough with their next four games being trips to Chelsea and Manchester City and home matches against Manchester United and Newcastle.\nLeicester defender Wout Faes says the players still believe they can stay up.\n\"Of course, there has to be belief,\" the Belgian said.\n\"Weekend after weekend the games count down. I don't think we have to think too much about going forward. \n\"We just have to think game by game and we have to start winning very soon because the games are counting down.\"\nThose who have watched some of their recent games, however, are not so optimistic.\nFormer Leicester midfielder Neil Lennon said on TNT Sports: \"I hate to say it about any group of players but it is really hard to make a case for them on what we have seen. \n\"West Ham didn't have to be anywhere near their best to win the game comfortably. There was zero quality, zero belief and the game just seemed to pass them by.\"\n\"I think they are gone,\" added former Chelsea forward Joe Cole. \"I think them and Southampton are gone. \n\"How do you get these players to show some kind of spark from now to the end of the season?\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "summary": "\"'Not even close to scoring' - Leicester's concerning statistics Leicester sacked Steve Cooper on 24 November with the club 16th after 12 league games, but the change has not had anywhere near the impact the Foxes would have hoped - and the statistics make for concerning reading:The Foxes have lost 11 of their past 12 Premier League games (won one).In his 14 games in charge, Van Nistelrooy has picked up just seven points, three fewer than previous boss Cooper managed this season (10 in 12 games).No side has conceded more own-goals in the Premier League this season than Leicester (three, level with West Ham and Wolves).Leicester have also failed to score in each of their past four Premier League games, last doing so in February 2017 (a run of six).On Leicester's struggles to score, Van Nistelrooy added: \"If you play like this in the first half you are not going to score. I don't think we have to think too much about going forward. \"We just have to think game by game and we have to start winning very soon because the games are counting down. \"'I think they are gone' - but can Leicester escape?In Leicester's favour, however, is time. Back in 2014-15 they were rooted to the foot of the table for much of the season, only climbing off it in April as a run of seven wins from their final nine games took them to unexpected safety.But this Leicester team look barely capable of winning one game, let alone going on a run of victories, as Thursday's 2-0 loss to West Ham left them five points adrift of safety.",

        "article_text": "The biggest night in British music is upon us, as the Brit Awards gear up for their 45th edition.\nCharli XCX leads the nominations this year, with five in total - including artist of the year and album of the year, all thanks to her critically-acclaimed, trend-setting album Brat.\nThe Essex-born singer will attend the show but, surprisingly, is not expected to perform. Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.\nSabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards. \nArriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.\nBetter still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set. \nA former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).\nHopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short n' Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.\nLiam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.\nGossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Zayn and Louis both on tour, that seems unlikely.\nAccording to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".\nQuoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.\n\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"\nIt's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.\n\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony. \n\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"\nHe's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.\nBut in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".\n\nWith 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT. International viewers can watch the show on the official Brits YouTube channel.\nBBC News will be live from the red carpet from 16:30GMT - with a live page providing coverage throughout the night. \nArtist of the year\nGroup of the year\nAlbum of the Year\nRead the full list of nominees here.\n",

        "article_text": "The Women's Super League returns from the international break this weekend\nAfter an international week, the Women's Super League returns on Sunday with a busy day of six matches.\nUnbeaten league leaders Chelsea resume their push for a sixth successive WSL title, holding a seven-point lead at the top with eight league games to go.\nSunday's matches are:\nManchester United v Leicester City (12:30 GMT - live on BBC iPlayer)\nAston Villa v Everton (14:00 GMT)\nCrystal Palace v Liverpool (14:00 GMT)\nTottenham v Manchester City (14:00 GMT)\nBrighton v Chelsea (15:00 GMT)\nArsenal v West Ham (17:30 GMT)\nHere are some of the talking points ahead of this weekend's games.\nThe fee Chelsea paid for Naomi Girma broke the previous world record of \u00a3685,000, when Bay FC signed Racheal Kundananji last February.\nChelsea fans have waited to see world record signing Naomi Girma make her first Blues appearance, and she may finally make her debut this weekend.\nGirma, who Chelsea signed from San Diego Wave for \u00a3900,000 in January, has yet to make an appearance as she has been recovering from a calf injury.\nBut she could be set to take to the field on Sunday, when Chelsea take on Brighton, with manager Sonia Bompastor telling a news conference on Friday that defender Girma \"should\" be in the squad.\nChelsea are seven points clear at the top of the table and are the only side still unbeaten. Their opponents, Brighton, are fifth and have not won in their past six league games.\nHowever, Brighton put up a good showing when these sides met earlier in the season and are bolstered by the return of former Chelsea forward Fran Kirby from injury.\n\"We'll go in with belief,\" said England international Kirby. \"The last game against Chelsea was probably one of the best performances of the season. Hopefully we can learn from that game. It's going to be a case of every player doing their job - and a half.\"\nLiverpool sacked manager Matt Beard after only winning four WSL games this season, while Laura Kaminski oversaw one victory in the league with Crystal Palace\nLiverpool and Crystal Palace go head to head on Sunday as the clubs begin new phases in the season after sacking Matt Beard and Laura Kaminski this week.\nLiverpool dismissed manager Beard on Thursday, with the Reds seventh in the WSL table, while bottom-of-the-league Palace announced Kaminski's exit on Friday.\nAmber Whiteley has taken interim charge of the Reds, with a search for a new manager already under way.\nWhiteley said in Friday's pre-match news conference she wants the job on a permanent basis.\n\"I will put my name in the hat, but let's get Palace out of the way first and I can think a bit longer term after that,\" she said.\n\"I am in a far better position having had the time with Matt and working under him. I'm so grateful to Matt for everything that he has given to me personally over the last three and a bit years. I'm going to miss him.\"\nPalace, who have only won one league match and collected six league points all season, said they \"will provide an update on Laura's replacement in due course\".\nManchester City are 12 points behind leaders Chelsea\nThe international break has given teams a break from regular football, but when Manchester City play Tottenham on Sunday it marks the beginning of a gruelling run of eight games in 29 days for Gareth Taylor's City side.\nThey have to contest the League Cup final, both legs of their Women's Champions League quarter-final and a league game against Chelsea, an FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, and other league games against West Ham and Brighton.\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, that manager Taylor says it will be \"really tough\" for his side to get the results they want in March.\n\"There's a lot going on in this month and I think the conversation will certainly be 'attack the next game, don't try and give too much thought to what's further down the road',\" Taylor said.\nThe situation is made even more difficult by the number of injuries in the squad \u2013 including a fresh hamstring issue for Rebecca Knaak \u2013 and players having departed.\nLaura Coombs, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood potentially completing their recoveries from injury could help, but that won't stop it being a tricky few weeks.\nRenee Slegers has not given up on Arsenal's title ambitions\nChelsea have pulled seven points clear at the top, but it remains tight between the teams who are battling for a spot in Europe.\nThe top three qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United are second with 33 points, Arsenal have 30 and Manchester City have 28.\nArsenal boss Renee Slegers has not given up of trying to pip Chelsea to the title.\n\"We need to believe that, and I do,\" she said.\n\"We have a very exciting block, full of opportunities ahead of us, and we're going to try and take those opportunities, and that's within our control.\"\nManchester United manager Marc Skinner also remains optimistic, believing that his side can go on to do \"magnificent things\".\n\"The reality is we have been going about our business under scrutiny for many years and probably forever will do. We have learned to get on with our job,\" Skinner said.\n\"There will be good times, there will be bad times. If you treat both of them the same you will be in a balanced position. If we are balanced we are a very good team that can go and do magnificent things.\"\nManchester United beat Leicester 2-0 at King Power Stadium in November\nLeicester gained only their third win of the WSL season on 16 February with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa to move up to 10th, six points clear of bottom-placed Crystal Palace.\nBut the Foxes' task could not be any tougher in the coming days, as they meet both the top two away from home in the space of four days.\nThey play on Sunday away against a Manchester United side who have won six WSL games in a row. After that, Amandine Miquel's Leicester travel to runaway leaders Chelsea, although the Foxes are the only side to take points off the Blues this season, drawing 1-1 in December.\n\"The team is ready, they are fighting,\" said Miquel on Thursday. \"We have two games so close so it will be an occasion for most of the players to play. We play opponents of good quality so we will make rotations to be able to have the best teams that we can put on the pitch.\n\"We want to go to every game like we can win. If we don't feel like that, we might as well not go and stay here. We're going to go for both games to do our best to see if we can get a point or two.\"",

He was told number 10 and you can see the good consequences of it.\"\nAsensio is not the only player who is flourishing since moving to Aston Villa, with Rashford appearing to be putting behind him a difficult season at Manchester United with a strong start to life in the Midlands.\nRashford had been struggling for form at Old Trafford and found himself out of the picture under Ruben Amorim.\nBut the move to Villa and playing alongside Asensio appears to bringing him back to his best.\nSince his debut on 9 February, Rashford has created more chances in all competitions than any other Premier League player (13).\nAgainst Cardiff, Rashford created six chances for Aston Villa, equalling the most he ever created in any of his 426 matches for Manchester United (six vs Wigan in January 2024).\nHe has yet to score, although given his performances so far that will surely come sooner rather than later.\n\"Aston Villa have given him a lifeline,\" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on ITV Sport. \n\"It seems to have come to an end at Manchester United. He needed to rebuild his confidence, he is 27 and has to show he has a lot to give. Villa have given him a good opportunity.\n\"Things could be very exciting here at Aston Villa with this new exciting Aston Villa forward line.\"\nWith a Champions League last-16 game at Club Brugge up next, Emery believes Asensio and Rashford maintaining their form is key to Villa achieving their ambitions this season.\n\"We need [Asensio] and we need Rashford,\" he said.\n\"We need the players who joined in the last window.

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south. \nAdditional reporting by Kevin Church.",

He added that the Buttles hoped it would \"bring certainty for all landowners who grant others recreational access to their land\". \nThe Buttle family has owned Whakaari/White Island since the 1930s, when their grandfather bought it and placed it in a family trust.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "The Brit Awards belonged to Charli XCX on Saturday night, who completed her transformation from underground hero to bona fide pop star by winning five awards including best artist and song of the year.\nEzra Collective, Sam Fender, Stormzy and The Last Dinner Party were the other big British winners on Saturday night, while Fontaines DC and Chappell Roan bagged the international awards. \nThe night also included a memorable, blush-inducing performance from US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter, who was handed the global success award at London's O2 Arena.\nThe arena fell silent near the end of the show for a moving video tribute to the late Liam Payne, who died last October.\nDespite not performing, Charli XCX stole the show by winning the biggest awards of the night - artist of the year, album of the year for her cultural phenomenon Brat, and song of the year for Guess.\n\"This is cool, I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff\", said Charli, dryly, on stage after collecting her first award.\n \"I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not sure what.\"\nShe went on to thank Eilish - the first non-Brit to appear on a best song-winner - for her guest vocals on Guess which she delivered at just three days notice. \"Thank you Billie for running and gunning...\"\nShe also picked up the best dance act and songwriter of the year awards.\nIn her speech for best dance act, she spoke of the importance of the night-time genre. \"I feel like dance music, electronic music gets a really bad rep' because everyone is like, 'it's not that deep, is it?'. And I kind of feel it is,\" she said.\n\"This genre of music for me is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nAs she collected her fifth and final award of the night for best album, Charli told the crowd how she had \"always felt like an outsider\" up until this point.\n\"Culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us - I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.\nIt's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.\nFans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule Britannia and a, ahem, close encounter with a beefeater.\nCarpenter also became the first international star to accept the global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of espresso.\"\nWearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.\nBest pop act winner, Jade - of little mix Fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.\nIn it she appeared in a blonde wig and big white fur coat before disappearing briefly somewhere in a crowd of dancers and re-emerging as an angel suspended above the stage. \nSeveral artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.\nJazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".\nChappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".\nRising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\" while urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.\nIt was also a night that marked the return of Sam Fender, with the Geordie singer-songwriter picking up the best alternative/rock act.\nHe thanked his band in his speech, saying he would just be a \"mad man shouting at walls\" without them.\nIt marks the end of a huge week for Fender, who also topped the UK album charts with People Watching - which had the biggest opening week for a British album since Harry Styles' Harry's House in 2022.\nHe topped off the evening with an emphatic performance of its title track.\nBest hip-hop winner Stormzy thanked Jesus and read a verse from the bible before explaining the was wearing shades as he had \"mashed my eye up playing padel\".\nBest R&B act winner Raye said via video that she was \"still recovering\" from last year's event when she won a record-breaking six awards.\nDublin rock band Fontaines D.C said they were \"buzzing\" to win best international group and did so, fittingly, from Down Under.\nAnd Teddy Swims performed his hit Lose Control on a flame-filled stage - a potential fire hazard in his baggy oversized jacket - before Lola Young played her viral hit in a Messy makeshift room.\nIt's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.\nHe poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".\nAnd referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".\nAiming a light dig at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".\nHaving flown over from US filming commitments a few days ago, he showed little signs of jet lag in his bid to \"Make the Brits Great Again\", as he had joked in a pre-show video this week.\n\"If you thought Trump-Zelensky was cringe then wait until you hear me...\" he quipped.\nIt reached peak cringe though when his parents appeared alongside him in one segment, with his dad dressed as Kanye West.\nThe biggest cheer of the night came when actor Danny Dyer told Whitehall that \"the world is being run by cranks\".\nLiam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina last October, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.\nThe ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.\n\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.\nSeven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.\nThere were also snubs for royal royalty The Beatles, Coldplay and The Cure, who like Dua, all lost out to Charli in various catergories.\nLet's hope they're not too Bratty about it.",

        "article_text": "Two hundred and fifty years ago, several small farming communities rose up against the British and helped form a new nation. Now, the towns are gearing up to party like it's 1775.\nOn 19 April 2025, Lexington, Concord and two other neighbouring towns north-west of Boston will mark the 250th anniversary of the chilly spring day in 1775 when Massachusetts militiamen faced off against British forces in a clash that launched the US on a path to independence.\nThe fateful die was cast when Paul Revere arrived on horseback to the small farming community of Lexington to warn leaders that British soldiers were marching from Boston to seize colonial military supplies stored in Concord, a few miles down the road. When the British arrived, they found a small force of local militiamen, known as Minutemen, waiting in the dawn light.\nNo one knows who fired the first shot, but when the skirmish was over, eight Minutemen lay dead, along with one British soldier. The British forces marched on to Concord where they met a larger force of Minutemen by the North Bridge. After fierce fighting and significant losses on both sides, the British retreated. Marching back to Boston, British troops faced a running battle as the towns of Lincoln, Lexington and Menotomy (now Arlington) had mustered their militias to mount an organised resistance.\nThe American War of Independence had begun.\nEvery year, the events of 19 April are celebrated with various historical reenactments and other special events in these small Massachusetts towns. But with additional celebrations planned in honour of the 250th anniversary, organisers are expecting this year's festivities to draw more travellers than ever before to what many call \"the birthplace of American liberty\".\nThis year's festivities kick off on 18 April with a commemoration of Paul Revere's famous midnight ride to Lexington, followed by a reenactment of the Battle of Lexington the following morning. On 21 April, an event honouring the opening shot of the Battles of Lexington and Concord will take place at Concord's North Bridge, while a host of special exhibits, lectures and parades will take place throughout April.\nTwo and a half centuries after shaping American history, Lexington's colonial heritage remains a defining presence, offering year-round visitors a window into the past. The Lexington Battle Green, where the Minutemen met the British forces, remains the centre of the quiet, 34,000-person community. A statue of farmer-turned Minuteman captain John Parker stands at one end, facing the direction from where British troops approached. Elsewhere, a stone marker on the Lexington Battle Green is engraved with the words Parker is said to have uttered to his men: \"Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.\" A memorial obelisk marks the spot where the Minutemen killed in the battle were reburied after being moved from their original graves in the nearby Old Burying Ground.\nNearby, the Lexington Visitors Center provides an overview of the events of 19 April along with a detailed diorama of the battle. From April through October, Liberty Ride trolley tours whisk travellers from the Visitors Center to historical sites in Lexington and Concord along the Battle Road that connects the two towns.\nNext door to the Visitors Center, Buckman Tavern, where the Minuteman gathered before the clash, is one of three historic houses maintained by the Lexington Historical Society. The other two include Munroe Tavern, which was occupied by retreating British soldiers after the battle; and the Hancock-Clarke House, where patriot leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams were staying when Revere arrived to sound the alarm.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The illegal church at the heart of US history\n\u2022 The first Black American global superstar\n\u2022 The only US capital with a royal residence\n\"Buckman Tavern really gives you a good overview of the battle, but also what life was like in 1775,\" said Lexington High School student Sabrina Bhattacharjya, who runs the history website Lexington250.com. \"My personal favourite is the Hancock-Clarke House. You kind of get to hear the kids' experience of the [American] Revolution. Elizabeth Clarke was a 12-year-old girl who wrote everything down that night in her diary, because she watched the midnight ride and Battle of Lexington out [of] her bedroom window.\"\nMonroe Tavern, in contrast, presents the perspective of the British, who used it as a field hospital during their retreat. \"It asks my very favourite question, and that is: who [were] the real patriots that day?\" said Craig Sandler, president of the board of the Lexington Historical Society, noting that British soldiers viewed the colonists as rebelling against their rightful king. \"The [British] were noble in their own way. You can't tell the story without both sides because it doesn't make sense.\"\nJust before the anniversary in April, the Lexington Historical Society will open a new museum in the Lexington Depot, a long-empty former train station built in 1846 in downtown Lexington. The museum will tell the story of the town through Revolutionary-era artefacts and other items that have been off-view for decades.\nIn addition to a larger-than-usual parade, filmmaker Ken Burns is scheduled to visit both Lexington and Concord on 17 April to present his new documentary series The American Revolution. Lexington's anniversary celebrations will also include a visit from approximately 250 members of the US Army's Old Guard and a dramatic landing on Lexington Green by the Golden Knights, the US Army Parachute Team.\nFrom Lexington, the British marched on to Concord through the town of Lincoln, along today's Battle Road. Much of the route they took is now part of Minute Man National Historical Park, as is the battle site at the North Bridge near downtown Concord. Visitor centres in Lincoln and near the North Bridge in Concord are good starting points to learn more, with educational films to set the stage. The park also incorporates several historic houses from the Revolutionary period and conducts anniversary reenactments of the Battle of Concord and other dramatic events of 19 April, including the capture of Paul Revere.\nThis year, the park is holding special events throughout April to mark the 250th anniversary, the highlight of which will be a Battle Road Tactical Demonstration on 19 April, where costumed interpreters will recreate battle tactics and the fighting that took place as the British retreated towards Boston.\n\"It will be the largest living history event of all the 250th events in this area. We have over 750-800 living historians that will be joining us for a whole day of events,\" said Minute Man park ranger Jim Hollister. \"On the night of the 12th, we're doing an evening programme at Hartwell Tavern portraying the ride of Samuel Prescott, who escaped capture after Paul Revere was captured by a British patrol, and he brings the alarm to the town of Lincoln.\"\nConcord's Visitor Center also offers guided tours focusing on the Revolution, including one called A Fight for Freedom: Patriots of Color. Stops include the historic Wright Tavern where Concord Minutemen gathered early on 19 April and British troops later established their headquarters. The town is also developing an app-based augmented reality tour that will be available this spring.\n\"The idea is that you get superimposed on an object,\" said Concord Tourism Manager Beth Williams. \"Walk into the Wright Tavern and a 3D figure could come up like a hologram and say, 'Oh, when I was 12, I worked as a barmaid in the Wright Tavern.' It gives another layer to the history, certainly to a younger demographic that is more used to getting content in that way.\"\nNearby, the Concord Museum has an extensive collection of artefacts related to the Revolution. \"We're able to narrate the events of the day essentially minute by minute, with objects that were actually there and that participated. The interpretive material is drawn from the words of participants to the degree that we're able,\" explained curator David Woods.\nBeyond visiting the museum and the historic site at the North Bridge, Woods recommends an exercise in observation and imagination. \"Standing in the centre of town,\" he said, \"look around for 18th-Century structures. Any one that you can see, it's reasonable to suspect that there were supplies stored there. You can go up on to the Old Hill Burying Ground, stand right where [British officers] Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn stood looking at the North Bridge sizing the thing up. There was a mountain of supplies in Concord and they didn't find it.\" \u00a0\nAsked why the events of Lexington and Concord continue to resonate with visitors, Hollister said, \"It's a very accessible story. The main actors weren't great generals and warriors \u2013 they were ordinary people just like us: men and women who were confronted with a crisis and had to decide what's worth fighting for. That's something I think every generation has to confront as they move through history in their own time.\"\n\"It's this feeling that this was the start. This was the first shot,\" added Bhattacharjya. \"We are a nation of immigrants. That first shot on the battlefield is what brought so many people here, and that's how we've grown as a country. All the inventions and all the greatness of America, it all started because you had a first shot.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.\nFor those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.\n\"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,\" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.\n\"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live.\"\nYulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.\nBefore the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.\nBefore Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.\n\"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,\" says 30-year-old Andriy. \"They don't respect the people of Ukraine.\"\n\"It looks like Washington supports Russia!\" observes Dmytro, 26.\nYou wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.\n\"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,\" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.\nWorld leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.\nHis ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.\nBut Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.\nNot least with his warming to Russia.\nThe initial reaction was that of shock,\" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.\n\"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,\" she adds. \"It's painful.\"\nUkrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.\nPerhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.\n\"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,\" argues Sovsun.\nThere are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.\n\"It's important to find the right mediator,\" she says. \"Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.\n\"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy.\"\nPresident Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.\n\"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,\" she adds. \"Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war.\"\nWhat the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.\n\"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,\" she says.\nWhile there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.\nHer European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.\nHe was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as \"threats to national security\" and \"creating obstacles to economic development\". Mr Poroshenko said it was \"politically motivated\".\nDespite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.\nAs sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.\nRussia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.\n\"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,\" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.\nAfter Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,\" he says.\nAs he ruthlessly pursues his \"America First\" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.\n\"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,\" says Mr Chmut.\n\"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Svitlana Libet.",
