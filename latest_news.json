        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "article_text": "Sainz (right) joined Williams after he lost his seat at Ferrari to Lewis Hamilton\nWilliams drivers Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon say it is wrong to threaten Formula 1 drivers with bans for swearing.\nSainz, who has moved to Williams from Ferrari, said he did not agree with the move by governing body the FIA to codify a system that can mean drivers are fined or suspended for swearing or criticising officials.\nAlbon, who is entering his fourth season with the team, added that the drivers had already spoken privately about how to respond to the move.\n\"There have definitely been discussions about it,\" Albon said. \"It's still ongoing about how we want to set out what we say around it. It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations.

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools.\n\"But what do you favour, the character of the man or someone who can pass off both hands at 16? There is good out of both.\"\nIf English rugby is short of the former, it could start looking in less familiar settings.\n\"There are thousands out there like me,\" says Genge of the state system's untapped talent.\n\"But until we open our doors to all the kids and give them the absolutely necessary tools and resources, we are going to keep having this conversation.\"",

Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockScience Secretary Peter Kyle has criticised the BBC's reporting on Rachel ReevesWhat did the HR manager say?Wayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team.",

        "article_text": "Ticket sales for Beyonc\u00e9's highly-anticipated Cowboy Carter tour seem to have gone without a hitch, with many fans expressing surprise at how easy the process was.\nIn contrast to the chaos surrounding Oasis and Taylor Swift's tours, online queues were kept to a minimum, and most people found the tickets they were looking for.\n\"I was in straight away, only 600 in front of me,\" wrote one fan on Reddit. \"I was able to find floor tickets for London even 30 min[utes] after general sale opened,\" added Shivam Arora on X. \"Not bad, to be honest.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9's six UK dates at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in June will be her first shows since 2023's record-breaking Renaissance Tour. \nTicketmaster said prices ranged from \u00a371 to \u00a3950, but cheaper tickets were also available direct from the stadium's own website.\nThe BBC was able to access Ticketmaster's page shortly after tickets went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Friday; and found tickets available in almost every section.\nThe stadium map slowly greyed out as seats were snapped up - but prices remained static, suggesting that \"dynamic pricing\" was not in place.\nNone of the dates were completely sold out at the time of writing, although in some cases only single seats remained.\nBeyonc\u00e9's tour launched on a massive day for concertgoers - with tickets also becoming available for Ozzy Osbourne's final gig with Black Sabbath plus Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Patti Smith, Beck, Morrissey, Mumford & Sons, Razorlight and Smashing Pumpkins.\nOne fan told the BBC they were willing to pay up to \u00a32,000 to attend Black Sabbath's charity concert in Birmingham, which will also feature performances from Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax, Gojira and members of Guns N' Roses.\n\"This really is Ozzy's final show with Sabbath,\" said Alex Woodford. \n\"I know it sounds crazy but I would be willing to pay silly money for it because it's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime show.\"\nBritish Beyonc\u00e9 fan Ben Archer, who has attended all of her concerts since 2014's Mrs Carter World Tour, was among those who secured tickets. \"She is the one artist I'm determined to see every time she tours,\" he told the BBC.\nEleven years ago, he paid \u00a360 for a standing ticket. This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

I believe that I belong in the Premier League and I'm a Premier League player.\"\nHis goalscoring exploits have delighted his manager, who believes the forward is still \"getting better\" as Everton climb the table.\n\"His chances have come through injuries [to other players],\" Moyes said. \"He probably saw a chance to play half a dozen games or so.\n\"It was down to him to show if he was capable.

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

The tribunal states that whether its decision has any benefit to the club, therefore, depends on whether the new APT rules are found to be lawful as part of the second challenge issued by the club last month. \n\"The League continues to believe that the new APT Rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter.\n\"The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to the Premier League for fair market value assessment.\"\nAPTs are commercial deals involving clubs and companies to which they have close ties. Restrictions on fair market values (FMVs) were introduced in December 2021, shortly after a Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle.\nThe Premier League has the right to assess the value of such deals to ensure they have not been inflated, which could give clubs more to spend under current financial rules.\nLast year, a tribunal ruled that low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the APTs. It also ruled that changes made to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\nFollowing the ruling, City criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion the regulations could be swiftly amended and said there should be no vote on changes before a further determination by the panel.\nHowever, in November, the Premier League voted through the amendments.\nThe Premier League said the rule changes related to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\nEarlier this month, City launched a fresh legal challenge, claiming the amendments are \"unlawful\".\nThe Premier League has already had to spend tens of millions of pounds on legal bills due to a range of recent disputes over its financial regulations. \nNow it faces the threat of further costs after a significant defeat that could lead to some clubs seeking compensation for what some sources believe could be dozens of commercial deals undervalued or rejected as a result of rules that have now been deemed to be unenforceable.\nWhile City feel vindicated by this ruling, the league's governance and ability to uphold its rulebook will now come under renewed scrutiny. But it could get worse for those in charge of the top-flight.\nIf the same arbitration panel decides that the amended set of rules are also void, the league could face a crisis.\nThere could be little preventing clubs like Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City and Saudi-owned Newcastle United from signing more lucrative deals with state-linked companies. While such clubs would welcome less restrictions on sponsorships and loans with 'associated parties', some rivals fear the league's competitive balance would be on the line.\nEnglish football is already braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the Premier League's separate disciplinary case against City.\nThe champions, who are facing 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches, deny any wrongdoing.\nBut the next few weeks could now feature another legal decision that also has a profound impact on the league's future direction.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas. \nModi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\nWhile both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\". \nThe Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US. \nAt a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.\n\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".\nTrump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries. \n\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.\nWith India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC. \n\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said. \nHowever, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said. \n\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit. \nTrump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets. \nThe two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".\nModi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US. \nLast week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday. \n Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\nShortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.\nHe acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".\nTrump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.\n\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"\nThe White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.\nThe document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.\n\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said. \n\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"\nTrump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic. \nHe has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. \nEarlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs.",

        "article_text": "Ticket sales for Beyonc\u00e9's highly-anticipated Cowboy Carter tour seem to have gone without a hitch, with many fans expressing surprise at how easy the process was.\nIn contrast to the chaos surrounding Oasis and Taylor Swift's tours, online queues were kept to a minimum, and most people found the tickets they were looking for.\n\"I was in straight away, only 600 in front of me,\" wrote one fan on Reddit. \"I was able to find floor tickets for London even 30 min[utes] after general sale opened,\" added Shivam Arora on X. \"Not bad, to be honest.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9's six UK dates at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in June will be her first shows since 2023's record-breaking Renaissance Tour. \nTicketmaster said prices ranged from \u00a371 to \u00a3950, but cheaper tickets were also available direct from the stadium's own website.\nThe BBC was able to access Ticketmaster's page shortly after tickets went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Friday; and found tickets available in almost every section.\nThe stadium map slowly greyed out as seats were snapped up - but prices remained static, suggesting that \"dynamic pricing\" was not in place.\nNone of the dates were completely sold out at the time of writing, although in some cases only single seats remained.\nBeyonc\u00e9's tour launched on a massive day for concertgoers - with tickets also becoming available for Ozzy Osbourne's final gig with Black Sabbath plus Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Patti Smith, Beck, Morrissey, Mumford & Sons, Razorlight and Smashing Pumpkins.\nOne fan told the BBC they were willing to pay up to \u00a32,000 to attend Black Sabbath's charity concert in Birmingham, which will also feature performances from Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax, Gojira and members of Guns N' Roses.\n\"This really is Ozzy's final show with Sabbath,\" said Alex Woodford. \n\"I know it sounds crazy but I would be willing to pay silly money for it because it's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime show.\"\nBritish Beyonc\u00e9 fan Ben Archer, who has attended all of her concerts since 2014's Mrs Carter World Tour, was among those who secured tickets. \"She is the one artist I'm determined to see every time she tours,\" he told the BBC.\nEleven years ago, he paid \u00a360 for a standing ticket. This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

Fans fight backOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.She said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.Fekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour.",

        "article_text": "Zakaria is 11 years old and lives in Gaza. He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.\nBut at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.\nAs a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.\nMoments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.\nSeveral of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)",

        "article_text": "A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country.\nThe properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board.\nThe new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion.\nOn 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders.\nThey claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation.\nThe new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.\nBut several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.\nA vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.\nThe tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.\nThe properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.\nThe government says that the waqf boards are among India\u2019s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).\nMuslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. \nBut critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies \u2013 which too requires immediate attention.\nA report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. \nThe committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.\nThe committee also noted that \u201cencroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common\u201d, listing hundreds of instances of such \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d of waqf land by government authorities.\nAccording to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.\nThe amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.\nParliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.\nBut many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.\nMany of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.\nThe 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.\nProfessor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.\n\u201cYou can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,\u201d Prof Rehman says.\nOthers worry that the new bill may not address the community\u2019s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.\nThat's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. \nSome agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. \nBut the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. \u201cThere seems to be an attempt not only to get the state\u2019s control over Muslims\u2019 properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community\u2019s lives.\u201d\nAmong other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf\u2019s claim to a property is valid.\nCritics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.\nThe current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.\nBut some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. \n\"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,\u201d Owaisi recently told reporters.\nThis process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.\n\u201cThe diagnosis may be correct,\u201d Prof Rehman says, \u201cbut the treatment is not.\u201d",

        "article_text": "With two major musicals in the awards race this year, it was only right that host David Tennant opened the Bafta Film Awards with a tune of his own. \nThe Scottish star kicked off proceedings with a storming rendition of The Proclaimers' 500 Miles, featuring contributions from Selena Gomez, Colman Domingo, Anna Kendrick, Hugh Grant and Camila Cabello.\nThe energy remained high throughout the ceremony, which saw Conclave and The Brutalist take the most prizes with four each. \nBackstage, the stars were in equally good spirits, even if a few of them were jet-lagged, hungry, and remarking on how heavy the Bafta trophy is to carry around.\nHere are eight highlights from the winners' room:\nWhen Anora star Mikey Madison collected the best actress award, she started by admitting to the audience that she hadn't prepared a speech.\nBackstage, she jokingly blamed this on Robert De Niro, whom she recently appeared with on The Graham Norton Show. \n\"I just wish that I'd had a better speech,\" she said.\n\"I was on a talk show and Robert De Niro told me not to write a speech and I thought, I should probably listen to him. And I forgot to thank so many important people.\"\nMadison was overwhelmed but overjoyed with the recognition from Bafta.\n\"I think I'm a little disassociated right now,\" she says, \"I love making movies, and being an actress is my dream, and for my film to be recognised like this is incredibly special.\n\"I don't know if I'll ever fully grasp the magnitude of being in a room like that, full of my idols, incredible creatives who I admire so much.\"\nWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl won two prizes for its producer Richard Beek and directors Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham. The trio brought their famous characters along with them to the ceremony.\nCrossingham reflected on the fact that stories about a cheese enthusiast and his loyal but long-suffering dog always seem to go down so well in the US, despite the films firmly rooted in UK culture.\n\"It is remarkable that our very Britishness is embraced in America,\" he told journalists.\nHe highlighted one particular reference in Vengeance Most Fowl: the TV presenter in the film is called Anton Deck, a reference to Geordie duo Ant & Dec.\n\"There are some jokes, like Anton Deck, which are very British. In the American screenings, there was complete silence apart from one Brit guffawing in the corner.\n\"But we're very proud of that, we stick to our guns. Apart from one or two very specific gags like that, it seems to be embraced.\n\"And even if they're laughing at us, not with us, if they're laughing, we're still happy about that.\"\nJesse Eisenberg, who won best original screenplay for A Real Pain, walked into the winners' room carrying his Bafta and asking journalists: \"Am I expected to hold this heavy thing the whole time?\"\nAfter being reassured he was allowed to put it down as he answered questions, he reflected on the fact that the screenwriting prizes he's won for A Real Pain have both been in the UK.\n\"The other award I won for this was the London Film Critics prize, so I must be living in the wrong country,\" he joked.\n\"My background is as a playwright, and when one of my plays transferred to the West End it was far more popular. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm a novelty here and in America I'm boring.\"\nEisenberg was also asked about his relationship with co-star Kieran Culkin, who won best supporting actor. But, he said, it's not as close as people might imagine.\n\"In terms of our dynamic, I'll text him today and say, 'hey you won the Bafta, I'm so proud of you'. And then three weeks later my phone will buzz and it'll be [Culkin saying]: 'Hey, I just got this, thanks'.\"\n\"That's the closeness with which you imagine we live.\"\nZoe Salda\u00f1a continued her awards season sweep of the best supporting actress category with another win at Bafta, despite the recent controversies faced by her film Emilia P\u00e9rez.\nBackstage, she reflected on her biggest number in the Spanish-language musical, El Mal, which is also up for best original song at the Oscars. \n\"Not getting in my own way was the challenge,\" she said of shooting it. \"Sometimes you can become very heady about something and you overthink it.\n\"What you have to do is trust the process... Rehearsing the dance was about reconnecting with a part of me I had missed so much but I had since let go of for more than 20 years.\n\"Reconnecting with that, dusting off all those cobwebs and jumping into the unknown was what needed to happen.\"\nAsked about the importance of performing the musical in Spanish, she replies: \"It's my first language, I was spoken to first, sung to first, in Spanish.\n\"We love we live, we fight, we work, in Spanish. And my art has [previously] only lived in a very English way. So that yearning to connect my culture with my art was meaningful to me.\"\nWarwick Davis was the recipient of this year's Bafta Fellowship, the British Academy's highest honour.\n\"It's very overwhelming, this whole thing,\" he said. \"You win the award and then you have to talk to loads of people, feeling very shiny.\" \n(Everyone was feeling sweaty backstage by this point.)\nAsked about the moment he heard he was this year's winner, Davis said: \"I was on the toilet when I found out!\n\"[Bafta] notified me by email, and I do most of my administration work on the toilet. I might call it paperwork but then you'd get the wrong idea,\" he jokes.\n\"Then I got an email from Bafta saying I'd won the fellowship, and I got all excited, and then it suddenly dawned on me, is this a fake email? Some sort of scam?\n\"So I clicked on the email address, and it really was Bafta. Then I finished up at the loo, you probably didn't need that detail, and then went and celebrated with the kids.\"\nAdrien Brody's reaction to winning best actor might have been slightly hampered by how hungry he is. \n\"I haven't eaten anything yet, so I'm not sure how I'm feeling, but I'm so happy to be here,\" he says backstage.\nBrody is asked about the surge his career has enjoyed in recent months thanks to The Brutalist, more than two decades after his last awards run for The Pianist.\n\"The beauty of being an actor is that any life experience, and there have been many since [The Pianist], anything you've experienced is so valuable in shaping a sense of understanding,\" he reflects.\n\"So the moments of triumph, loss, complexity along your path, they give you an ability to represent those more truthfully and authentically in your work.\n\"I'm just so grateful to have had this meaningful opportunity come my way, I've been yearning for this for a long time.\n\"I've been working very hard. It's not for a lack of hard work, but there are so many magical things that have to happen for a film to achieve greatness and I'm so happy that all of those things conspired on The Brutalist.\"\nAnd with that, he's off to have some supper.\nConclave won best film and best British film, becoming the first movie to take the top two prizes since 1917 (the film, not the year).\n\"I am so humbled and so grateful to be welcomed here so openly with such warmth and open arms,\" its German director Edward Berger says of the UK. \"Basically, I just want to live here, I'm never going to leave.\"\nHe likens the cast of Pope drama Conclave, which includes Stanley Tucci, Ralph Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini, to an orchestra.\n\"No-one really knows [why a cast works so well], but you have a hunch, so there's a lot of discussion - we put pictures up on the wall and it just felt like a good combination,\" he explained.\n\"They were all believable cardinals, all different nationalities and accents, it just felt they were all different instruments in a big musical piece.\"\nThe Brutalist's Brady Corbet might have won best director, but he said he was slightly too \"jet-lagged and exhausted\" to fully process it. \nAs much as he's enjoying awards season, he notes: \"It'll be amazing when it's done, I'm looking forward to getting back to work.\"\nCorbet is not shy of hard work - making the Brutalist was famously a labour of love which took several years. \"We basically just didn't sleep,\" he says. \"I haven't had a day off in years.\"\nNow that awards campaigning is in its final phase however, with voting for the Oscars closing on Monday, he should finally get some down time. \"The week leading up to the Oscars is actually pretty quiet, I'm looking forward to it.\"\nThe Brutalist, a 3.5-hour film with an intermission, has been a relative box office success despite its intimidating duration.\n\"I'm not trying to teach anyone a lesson or anything,\" he says, \"but I do think it's good for the ecosystem that a film like this which is completely uncompromised - I don't like too many cooks in my kitchen - for that to have made $30m globally so far, that's exciting.\n\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

        "article_text": "It has been more than a decade since James Howells' hard drive - containing Bitcoin now worth hundreds of millions of pounds - ended up on a landfill site. \nBut despite facing numerous setbacks, he is determined to continue on his mission to retrieve it.\n\"This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,\" he said, adding he would \"absolutely not\" give up.\nThe value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about \u00a3620m, Mr Howells said \"it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this\" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies. \nMr Howells, from Newport, claimed his ex-partner mistakenly threw out the hard drive, containing 8,000 bitcoins, in 2013, with it ending up in a tip owned by Newport City Council. \nLast month, a High Court judge threw out his efforts to access the landfill or get \u00a3495m in compensation, saying there were no \"reasonable grounds\" for bringing the claim and \"no realistic prospect\" of succeeding at a full trial.\nHe is now planning a case \u2013 representing himself using artificial intelligence to support his claim \u2013 at the Court of Appeal. He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year. \nNewport council said it was making no further comment on the matter.\nMr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value.\nHe has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive \u2013 about the size of a mobile phone \u2013 containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013.

It's not right.\"\nAs part of an effort organizers dubbed #TeslaTakeover, clutches of protesters across the country gathered outside the company's showrooms, having largely planned when to meet and where on the social media platform Bluesky, an upstart competitor to Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.\nIn some places, those protests barely numbered a dozen, with people in Washington DC, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Lyndhurst, Ohio, stamping their feet to stay warm amid snow and cold weather. Some held signs that read \"Say no to Doge\" and \"Deport Musk\".\nThe protest in Berkeley - a top California city for electric car ownership - numbered 200.\nAs part of his White House-backed effort called Doge, for Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has been sending teams into government agencies to comb through data and pushing for massive spending cuts as well as \"clawbacks\" of money already spent. \nPresident Donald Trump, who received an historic amount of campaign donations from Musk, is on the same page, freezing hiring as well as laying off thousands of federal employees.\nMusk says he has uncovered wasteful spending and his work is aimed at making the government operate more smoothly. But to many, he is stopping the government from functioning while making decisions that should be left to elected leaders and accessing private information.\n\"It's just really grinding on the mind,\"  said Dale Koistinen. \"I'm 84 years old. This is unbelievable. This is a takeover of our government.\"\nAlong with X, Musk also is the primary owner SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. But it is Tesla he is most known for and Tesla is where people unhappy with his Doge work are taking out their anger.\nFor days, concerned Americans have been asking fellow citizens to dump their Tesla stock and sell their Tesla vehicles.\nSinger-songwriter Sheryl Crow posted a video to Instagram that showed her Tesla being towed away.\n\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,\" she wrote in the caption. \"So long Tesla.\"\nCrow added that she was donating proceeds from the car's sale to National Public Radio in the U.S., a frequent target of Musk's ire.\nTesla stock surged following Donald Trump's election in November. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election effort, and hit the trail on Trump's behalf in the final days of the campaign.\nBut after touching an all-time high in December, the company's shares have shed 30% of their value with a pronounced selloff since Trump was inaugurated last month.\nSaturday's protests were promoted by prominent disinformation researcher Joan Donovan and the actor Alex Winter, who played Bill in the 80s movie \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.\" \nTeah Jackson, though, noticed the Berkeley protest during an outing with her girlfriend, and stopped to show her support.\n\"It's hopeful,\" Jackson told the BBC. \"It's an acknowledgement that people aren't going to go down without a fight and that they're going to continue to push for what they believe in.\"",

        "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney gives you his team and manager of the week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Brentford have been iffy but he was a huge part of why they were able to walk away with a 1-0 victory against West Ham. It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

The tribunal states that whether its decision has any benefit to the club, therefore, depends on whether the new APT rules are found to be lawful as part of the second challenge issued by the club last month. \n\"The League continues to believe that the new APT Rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter.\n\"The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to the Premier League for fair market value assessment.\"\nAPTs are commercial deals involving clubs and companies to which they have close ties. Restrictions on fair market values (FMVs) were introduced in December 2021, shortly after a Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle.\nThe Premier League has the right to assess the value of such deals to ensure they have not been inflated, which could give clubs more to spend under current financial rules.\nLast year, a tribunal ruled that low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the APTs. It also ruled that changes made to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\nFollowing the ruling, City criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion the regulations could be swiftly amended and said there should be no vote on changes before a further determination by the panel.\nHowever, in November, the Premier League voted through the amendments.\nThe Premier League said the rule changes related to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\nEarlier this month, City launched a fresh legal challenge, claiming the amendments are \"unlawful\".\nThe Premier League has already had to spend tens of millions of pounds on legal bills due to a range of recent disputes over its financial regulations. \nNow it faces the threat of further costs after a significant defeat that could lead to some clubs seeking compensation for what some sources believe could be dozens of commercial deals undervalued or rejected as a result of rules that have now been deemed to be unenforceable.\nWhile City feel vindicated by this ruling, the league's governance and ability to uphold its rulebook will now come under renewed scrutiny. But it could get worse for those in charge of the top-flight.\nIf the same arbitration panel decides that the amended set of rules are also void, the league could face a crisis.\nThere could be little preventing clubs like Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City and Saudi-owned Newcastle United from signing more lucrative deals with state-linked companies. While such clubs would welcome less restrictions on sponsorships and loans with 'associated parties', some rivals fear the league's competitive balance would be on the line.\nEnglish football is already braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the Premier League's separate disciplinary case against City.\nThe champions, who are facing 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches, deny any wrongdoing.\nBut the next few weeks could now feature another legal decision that also has a profound impact on the league's future direction.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools.\n\"But what do you favour, the character of the man or someone who can pass off both hands at 16? There is good out of both.\"\nIf English rugby is short of the former, it could start looking in less familiar settings.\n\"There are thousands out there like me,\" says Genge of the state system's untapped talent.\n\"But until we open our doors to all the kids and give them the absolutely necessary tools and resources, we are going to keep having this conversation.\"",

He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.He had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.Instead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.Image source, George PaulImage caption, Paul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school playersHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.\nOn Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.\nIn outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.\nWhile big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.\nThe memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days. \nTrump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April. \nTrump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.\n\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".\n\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"\nAs well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports. \nTrump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.\nStill, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"\nIn recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.\nAhead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".\n\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good. \nCountries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nHistorically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium. \nThe US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.\nIn setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US. \nThe White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.\nBut officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax. \nThose kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK. \nDuncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus. \n\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said. \n\nThursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration. \nEarlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.\nHe also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March. \nShares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced. \nJohn Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".\nBut he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy. \n\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.\nHowever, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves. \nHe does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation. \n\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said. \nHe noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.\n\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.\nTrump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.\n\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"\nBut surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households. \nA recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats. \n\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".\nReporting contributed by Tom Espiner",

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "article_text": "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.\nUK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.\nThe MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.\nAsked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.\nThe Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.\nThe rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.\nThe inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.\nBBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.\nThe MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.\nThe confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.\nThe Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: \"There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.\"\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?\nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.\nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\nSignal: 0044 7714 956 936\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.Documents disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.Special forces blocked resettlement for elite Afghan troopsMinister says Afghan commandos described 'horrific' SAS crimesSAS unit repeatedly killed Afghan detainees, BBC findsMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".

        "article_text": "Sainz (right) joined Williams after he lost his seat at Ferrari to Lewis Hamilton\nWilliams drivers Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon say it is wrong to threaten Formula 1 drivers with bans for swearing.\nSainz, who has moved to Williams from Ferrari, said he did not agree with the move by governing body the FIA to codify a system that can mean drivers are fined or suspended for swearing or criticising officials.\nAlbon, who is entering his fourth season with the team, added that the drivers had already spoken privately about how to respond to the move.\n\"There have definitely been discussions about it,\" Albon said. \"It's still ongoing about how we want to set out what we say around it. It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings. They already tell us what to say on the radio.\n\"But when you hear that passion, those words, even if sometimes we swear on the radio, for me that's a keeper in F1 and it is something we shouldn't get rid of.\"\nThe FIA has not explained how the new system will be applied, but last year president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said he wanted to stop drivers swearing while driving.\nSainz said the drivers have not had any clarification from the FIA.\nHe and Albon both drove Williams' new 2025 car as it was unveiled at Silverstone on Friday.\nVerstappen restricts answers after 'ridiculous' swearing punishment\nFerrari's Leclerc fined for swearing in news conference\nF1 drivers ask FIA to treat them like adults\nSainz explained that his first impressions were \"positive\", and he said Williams' willingness to host a day for media and sponsors and give the car its debut at the same time was indicative of the progress the team had made.\nLast year, the team struggled at the start of the season as attempts to introduce new processes in the team delayed the car build. A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

        "article_text": "The spotlight is on Philippe Clement (left) and Jimmy Thelin (right) while Daizen Maeda could be Celtic's key man in Munich\nThe Premiership returns this weekend after a Scottish Cup weekend that did not lack for storylines.\nThe Ibrox inner sanctum has said nothing about Philippe Clement's position since their cup exit and in that vacuum gossip and fan fury have thrived. \nRangers' trip to Tynecastle on Sunday is therefore eagerly awaited - and so too is Aberdeen's game against Dundee, with Jimmy Thelin also remarkably feeling the heat.\nThere are calmer waters at Celtic, but the biggest game of their season looms large.\nHere are a few things to look out for this weekend...\nClement will perhaps be surprised he is still in charge at Ibrox after the embarrassing Scottish Cup exit against Queen's Park.\nWith Rangers failing to mount a title challenge, the defeat against the Spiders has turned up the heat significantly on the Belgian.\nRangers' hierarchy have been tight-lipped all week, which is a backing of sorts. But Clement will surely know a poor result at Tynecastle will nudge him closer to an exit.\nSix weeks ago he might have fancied his side's chances of earning a morale-boosting victory, but Neil Critchley has steadily improved Heart of Midlothian since taking time to assess the squad.\nThey have won four of their five league games in 2025 - with one draw - which is as many victories as in their final 22 matches of 2024.\nCammy Devlin has been pivotal to their resurgence. He tops the table for the number of tackles (23) as well as being joint-top for interceptions in the Premiership in 2025. \nTo get at Hearts' defence, first you have to find a way past the Australia defensive midfielder. His availability after a concussion at St Mirren on Monday could well be key to this game.\nThe loan signing of Belgian striker Elton Kabangu seems to have liberated Lawrence Shankland too, and the Jambos showed the sort of resilience that was sorely lacking earlier in the season when they edged past the Buddies in the Scottish Cup.\nYet, despite the cloud hanging over Clement, Rangers have won each of their past four league games - and all by a margin of at least two goals. It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.\nHistory is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.\nRangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.\nThat record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.\nThis video can not be played\nMOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'\nThird-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.\nThat said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.\nSo, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.\nCould that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?\nHe has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.\nPerhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.\nMight Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?\nIf he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?\nThis video can not be played\nHighlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline Athletic\nEvery new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.\nIt usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.\nThen Thelin pitched up. \nThe Dons had chased the Swede for a long time before landing him and it soon became clear why they had been so patient. Ten wins from their first 11 Premiership games at the start of the season and a dramatic point at Celtic led to talk of a title challenge.\nThelin had somehow turned largely the same squad that saw off Neil Warnock within eight games into one that seemed poised to push Celtic into the new year.  \nHis stock went through the roof and there was even gossip linking him with ambitious Birmingham City.\nBut if his stock rose rapidly, it has dropped even more quickly. Aberdeen have lost eight and drawn one of their past nine league games - as many defeats as in their previous 37 games.\nThey have gone from putting pressure on Celtic in second to fourth - just five points ahead of eighth.

        "summary": "It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.History is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.Rangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.That record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, MOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'Player to watch - Daizen Maeda (Celtic)Third-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.That said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.So, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.Could that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?He has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.Perhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.Might Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?If he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline AthleticManager in the spotlight - Jimmy Thelin (Aberdeen)Every new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.It usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.Then Thelin pitched up. Thelin, incredibly, is under serious pressure for his job within two months of being touted as Fergie 2.0.His tactics and style of play have been criticised, with suggestions other teams have now worked him out.The good news for him is the Dons play Dundee next.Aberdeen's last league win was against Dundee, three months ago, and the last time they won an away league game was against Dundee, almost five months ago.Tony Docherty's side have conceded more goals (53) and faced a higher expected goals against total (46.1) than any other side in the Premiership this season. Oh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.Aberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. They have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. Rangers' trip to Tynecastle on Sunday is therefore eagerly awaited - and so too is Aberdeen's game against Dundee, with Jimmy Thelin also remarkably feeling the heat.There are calmer waters at Celtic, but the biggest game of their season looms large.Here are a few things to look out for this weekend...Game of the weekend - Hearts v RangersClement will perhaps be surprised he is still in charge at Ibrox after the embarrassing Scottish Cup exit against Queen's Park.With Rangers failing to mount a title challenge, the defeat against the Spiders has turned up the heat significantly on the Belgian.Rangers' hierarchy have been tight-lipped all week, which is a backing of sorts.",

If untreated, it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis C cause inflammation of the liver and come from viral infections, according to the NHS. Both can be contracted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.  \nOpt-out testing for blood-borne viruses has been seen by health officials and ministers as a resounding success for the NHS, which has not yet released the names of the latest hospitals added to the scheme.\nThe BBC understands health leaders hope to expand opt-out testing to detect more diseases in the future. \nSean Connaughton, from London, told the BBC he would \"have been dead\" had it not been for the opt-out testing. \nHe is one of the hundreds of people to discover they were living with HIV after being diagnosed through the scheme.\nHe attended hospital in October 2023 after suffering from seizures and losing 20kg (44lbs) through repeated sickness.\n\"Unless I had gone to A&E and I had done that test, my diagnosis would never have been known,\" Mr Connaughton said.\nWithout a diagnosis, doctors told him \"some of the other infections I had would have gone into my spine and into my brain\", he told the BBC.\n\"Two days prior to being admitted, I'd had a seizure in the bathroom and smashed my head into the basin and passed out, so the body was already breaking at that point. \n\"I wouldn't have survived, I don't think, another couple of weeks, if I hadn't been tested.\"\nRichard Angell, the chief executive of sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said opt-out testing was a \"win-win for everyone\".\n\"The benefit of opt-out testing is that you can get a test to people that would otherwise never come forward for a HIV test,\" Mr Angell said.\nHe added \"that means a transformation for the individual\" who can begin to take medication, which \"means the virus is no longer attacking their immune system and they can't pass it on if they're having sex or having a baby\".\nMr Angell said early testing also makes \"good money sense for the NHS\" as it allows early treatment, which stops HIV progressing, preventing severe illness, emergency visits and more costly treatments.\nThe testing forms part of a pledge by Sir Keir Starmer to eliminate new transmissions of HIV by 2030.\nEarlier this week, Sir Keir became the first sitting prime minister to publicly take an HIV test.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

I thought I just did enough but no excuses,\" said Catterall.\nBarboza Jr extended his unbeaten record to 32 pro wins \nEurope's largest indoor arena \u2013 with a capacity of 23,500 - was around a third full as a boisterous crowd repeatedly chanted 'Chorley' to welcome Lancastrian Catterall to the ring.\nQuite fittingly, he made his entrance to the song 'I just can't wait to be king' from the Lion King.\nCatterall, who started boxing aged 11 and turned pro in 2012, is a reserved family man, yet there has been a swagger and spring in his step throughout fight week. \nBarboza, though, had won all 31 of his pro fights and arrived in the UK full of confidence on the back of a career-best win over Jose Ramirez in November.\nNeither fighter was willing to overcommit early on and Catterall edged the first two rounds with the cleaner work. The Californian responded well, cutting off the ring and landing jabs and good body shots.\nA terrific counter-puncher, southpaw Catterall's approach, while appreciated by purists, does not always lend to the most entertaining of styles.\nHe landed a great two-punch combination in the sixth round, before his rival returned the favour with a flush right.\nCatterall was warned for a low blow in the seventh and, as the round drew to a close, his legs dipped after a right from Barboza.\nThe Catterall faithful turned the volume up a notch when the American hit the canvas in the 11th. He instantly shot up to his feet and protested a slip, with replays showing he fell over Catterall's trailing leg as a jab landed.\nBarboza and Catterall both celebrated at the final bell as pundits and ringside reporters shrugged their shoulders and compared contrasting scorecards with the decision too close to call.\nA frustrated Catterall was consoled by trainer Jamie Moore\n\nThe loss was disappointing for Catterall, who was enjoying a golden period in his career. In the past 15 months, he had beaten former champions Taylor, Jorge Linares and Regis Prograis.\nBut he came up against an undefeated foe who was motivated by his own pursuit for world honours.\n\"I want to see him go and fight for the world title, hopefully he beats Teofimo,\" added Catterall. \"It's straight back to the gym for me.\"\nCatterall missed out on becoming England's first male undisputed champion in the four-belt era when he lost to Taylor three years ago in Glasgow. Most ringside observers felt he should have been awarded the decision against the Scot.\nIf he does not ever win a world title, that loss \u2013 and the injustice of it \u2013 may unfortunately be what 'El Gato' will be most remembered for.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Thousands of Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers are logging off during peak hours on Valentine's Day in a campaign for better pay and working conditions, a union says.\nThe strike action is taking place across the UK from 16:00 to 22:00 GMT.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would unite \"drivers up and down the country faced with low pay and insecure conditions\". \nUber, Bolt and Addison and Lee have defended their working conditions after the IWGB said drivers in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Brighton were backing the strike.\nVasilica Dumitrescu has been working for various platforms, including Uber and Bolt, for the last nine years. The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's future is the focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), just days after a shock phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the Ukraine war.\nDescribing the call earlier this week as \"great\", Trump said there was a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war\". \nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country must not be left out of any peace talks.\nEuropean allies seemed surprised at the nature of the call, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning that any peace agreement which involved capitulating to Russia would end \"badly for everyone\".\nIt is still unclear when peace negotiations could begin, but when they do issues around territory, security negotiations and Ukraine's future in Nato will be among the key topics for discussion. Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.\nCheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.\nNow, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.\n\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.\n\"That's what we want.\"\nMr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.\nProductions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.\nThe loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.\nBefore the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.\n\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"\nHollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.\nMany say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA. \nBut studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.\nStudios are, however, very responsive to A-list actors.\nMegastar Vin Diesel helped ensure Universal Pictures would finish filming the latest Fast and Furious movie in Los Angeles.\n\"LA really, really, really needs production to help rebuild,\" Diesel said in an Instagram post.\n\"Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago\u2026 and now Fast will finally return home.\"\nNearly 20,000 people \u2013 including actors Keanu Reeves, Zooey Deschanel and Kevin Bacon \u2013 have signed a \"Stay in LA\" petition urging the state's leaders to temporarily remove caps on production tax incentives for LA County.\nIt's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.\n\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.\nBefore the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.\nHe says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.\nIf passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.\nPresident Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".\nIt's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.\nOn a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.\n\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.\nAlthough he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.\nMs Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.\n\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"\nOthers think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.\nPointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.\nHis once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.\n\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.\nAbout a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.\nShe laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.\n\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.\nMs Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.\n\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"\nDoes she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?\n\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\"",

        "article_text": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues. \nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model. They've got some outstanding young German coaches. We have one coaching our national team, which is fantastic.\n\"What you see - and this is over the last 10 years - is that they have younger coaches who have been given opportunities in the Bundesliga.\n\"They've been more exposed to that level earlier, so maybe that's something we can look at. But, for me, it's not about the nationality of a manager, it's about the qualities that they bring.\"\nWith just 20 managerial spots available does the Premier League feel a bit of a closed shop?\n\"Sometimes,\" says Still. \"But it's difficult to sort of have a grasp or a proper sense of what the reality is.\n\"I don't know what those Premier League clubs are thinking. I don't know how they're working. I don't know what their next step in their recruitment process is.\n\"It's the best league in the world for a reason so you've got to be one of the best in the world and that's what I think we all aspire to do.\"\nRosenior sees it somewhat differently.\n\"I think it depends on what your ultimate goal is,\" he says. \"My ultimate goal isn't to be in the Premier League.\n\"I don't think football is a linear thing where you say, 'Right, I worked in the Championship, I'm going to go to the Premier League'.\n\"My ultimate goal is to be the best coach I can be and it's up to the decision makers at each football club to pick who they think the right coach is for their club.\"\nThere was a time when few British players ventured overseas, but the numbers are growing season upon season. Should British coaches seek to do similar?\n\"I think it's a great experience,\" says Still \"I think learning about different cultures, different ways of playing the game, different opposition, different players. I'd definitely encourage it because you open yourself up to a lot more.\"\nRosenior adds: \"It's not for me to say to anyone where they should take their careers. And it's not about nationality. It's just about being the best person you can be and working as hard as you can every day.\"\nBoth Rosenior and Still have worked exceptionally hard to get to where they are right now in their careers and the decisions they have made have set them on a collision course which will culminate, temporarily at least, at Lens' Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Sunday.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMan City's Egyptian Prince - Lineker on Marmoush\nThere is not much Erling Haaland has failed to do when it comes to scoring goals since he joined Manchester City.\nFifty-two overall in his first season, including 36 in the Premier League, the most anyone has scored in a single campaign.\nThirty-eight in his second, despite being injured for almost two months, and 27 so far this term.\nThat incredible haul has secured the Norwegian two Golden Boots and an incredible 11 hat-tricks. \nYet none of those trebles came quicker than the 13 minutes and 54 seconds Omar Marmoush took to get his first City hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Newcastle.\nAfter four games without scoring since his \u00a359m winter transfer window move from German side Eintracht Frankfurt, it was an impressive and well-timed surge in form given City go to Real Madrid for their crucial Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday with a one-goal deficit to overcome after a 3-2 loss at home. \nIt was also the first time any City player other than Haaland had scored three times in a game since Phil Foden did it at Brentford just over a year ago.\nAnd that is the point.\nOne of the notable features of the terrible mid-season run of one win in 13 games, which wrecked any chance City had of extending their record run of four successive titles - and was mainly responsible for them ending up having to face Real Madrid so early in the Champions League - was the fact hardly anyone picked up the slack when Haaland's form dipped.\nJosko Gvardiol, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva all scored two goals in that time. But other than Haaland, who got four, no-one scored more.\nMarmoush hits quickfire treble as Man City thrash Newcastle\nOmar Marmoush had scored 20 goals in all competitions for Eintracht Frankfurt this term, when he joined Manchester City\nIt is that issue Guardiola was trying to address when he called contacts in Germany to check up on Marmoush after sporting director Txiki Begiristain had put the Egyptian's name forward as a part of City's overall \u00a3180m January transfer window spend.\n\"When Txiki came to me I said, because of the season we had, the more players you bring the better,\" said Guardiola.\n\"I called some contacts in Germany because I have friends there. I asked a few things and there was a high opinion in many things; behaviour, in training sessions, goals.\n\"He's young and comes here to make his career. That is why the club decides. They always have the last word.\"\nMarmoush had already demanded attention through the 20 goals he scored for Eintracht in the first half of this season.\nAt 26, City were buying someone approaching the prime of their career.\nOn the evidence of his performance against Newcastle, Marmoush drives forward with purpose when the ball is at his feet, is quick and can find space. \nEvidently he presents a danger opposition defences cannot ignore \u2013 and Newcastle could not contain.\nThat, in turn, may take some of the focus away from Haaland.\n\"Everything about his game was impressive,\" former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day. \n\"Already he has a good understanding with Haaland. Newcastle couldn't live with him.\"\n\"We knew with the dynamic he would be good,\" added Guardiola. \"In Germany he made good numbers and he had three chances last week against [Leyton] Orient but didn't score.\n\"He likes to attack the space. It is simple. When you play well, everybody adapts quick. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments because they will come now.\"\nIt was one of those rare occasions when Haaland didn't score and contributed a single assist, for James McAtee, six minutes from time.\nYet his industry was notable, leading from the front in a performance befitting his status as captain for the first time.\nNormally, Guardiola stays out of the captaincy issue, preferring to let the players decide on the leadership group.\nHowever, with club skipper Kyle Walker now at AC Milan, others who have done the job previously, Kevin de Bruyne and Bernardo, on the bench and Ilkay Gundogan overlooked for the role since his return from Barcelona in the summer, Guardiola stepped in to make sure Haaland - who last month signed a new deal that runs to 2034 - took the role.\n\"When Kyle left, Kevin became the first but I nominated Erling, not them,\" said the City boss.\n\"When a player is going to be here 10 years, sooner or later, you need to take the responsibility. He did it for the first time.\"\nGuardiola also played down the injury Haaland appeared to suffer in the final minutes.\nThe Norway international initially sat down and flexed his leg before the physios came on. It was immediately decided to take him off.\nHowever, Haaland watched the remainder of the game from the bench and went back on to the pitch to shake hands with opposition players after the final whistle.\n\"When he went down, everyone was scared,\" added Guardiola.\n\"But he got up and walked away smiling as always. I didn't speak with him but the doctors didn't come with bad news.

        "article_text": "How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nA popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: \"I don't care about Levy, he doesn't care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski.\"\nProminent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: \"Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed\" and \"24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change\".\nA crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.\nThe debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.\nFan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.\nClub sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.\nTottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.\nA 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\nLast week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.\nAmong those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.\nBBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.\nSome of the key points made were:\nLevy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structures\nHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide away\nAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially\nClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals\nSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies.\nA banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy's tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the \"most profitable club in Premier League history\" because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a \"degree of caution\" on transfer spending.\nHe describes Spurs as a \"superb cash-making machine\" who have \"outperformed any other club in England\".\nMaguire outlined:\nHis figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made \u00a3171m profit.

In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned \u00a36.6m.\nDaniel Levy has been Tottenham's chairman since 2001\nClub insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham's progress under his leadership.\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be \"very ruthless\" but \"genuinely wants the best for Spurs\".\nThey claimed some of the \"own goals\" - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not \"surround himself with the best people\". \nThey described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as \"people too similar to him\" who will \"sit with their heads in their phones\", rather than \"people who make up for [Levy's] weaknesses\".\nThe source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: \"One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot.\"\nWhile Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".\nAnother source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".\nThey added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.\nFrom the archive: Inside Levy's 20 years at Tottenham (2021)\nPostecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy?\nIs Postecoglou's style causing Tottenham's injury crisis?\nSources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. \nThey say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table.\nWhile Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner.\nThat means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say.\nDuring the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club.\nOther sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League's highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated \u00a350m-plus over his 25 years in charge.\nThis week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs' ownership situation played it down.\nIn 2023, when Paris St-Germain's owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\nOne source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \"more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement\" - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates.\nVarious reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn.\nChelsea were bought in a deal worth up to \u00a34.25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was \u00a32.5bn with a commitment to spending \u00a31.75bn over the next 10 years.\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for \u00a31.03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to \u00a35bn for 100% of the club.\nDespite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential.\nAccording to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new \u00a31.2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was \"all-consumed\" and the board \"left everyone to do their jobs\". \nSpurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.\nThat source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.\nPaul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.\nIt could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".\nAnother source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".\nThey said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.\nHowever, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. \nOne criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.\nLevy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".\nThey are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.\nThe source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.\nThey added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.\nIt was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".\nSources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. \nThey will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation.\nTottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.\nIt is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models.\nSpurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the 'traditional top six' are either richer or bigger.\n\"We don't make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don't apologise at all,\" Levy said at September's fan forum.\n\"We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we've got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we're looking for.\"\nIn a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United's 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. \nThey believe a \"vocal minority\" of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change.\nThey added: \"Spurs haven't got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come.\"\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

        "summary": "Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.Fan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.Club sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.Tottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.A 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.Last week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.Among those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.BBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.Some of the key points made were:Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structuresHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide awayAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financiallyClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finalsSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies. \"While Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".Another source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".They added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.From the archive: Inside Levy's 20 years at Tottenham (2021)Published7 March 2021Postecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy?Published26 JanuaryIs Postecoglou's style causing Tottenham's injury crisis?Published21 JanuaryWould Levy ever step aside?Sources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham.

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodiverse people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents.\nThe choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; \u00a3105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad.\n\"I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,\" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. \"But I've ended up with a bounty!\"\nChloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago.\nIn 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels.\nHer protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the caf\u00e9 in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest.\nHong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her \u2013 in which she is aged 11.\n\"It freaked me out at first,\" she says, but then she fired back a public response.\n\"I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them.\"\nChloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997.\n\"Politics were never in my life before\u2026 so I went to the first protest with curiosity,\" she said.\nShe saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck.\n\"I was so shocked,\" she says. \"That moment actually changed how I looked at the world.\"\nGrowing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms \u2013 she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about \"what we like and don't like\" and  \"could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like\".\nBut the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge.\n\"I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],\" she says. But when things started to get \"really crazy\",  she browbeat her parents into coming with her.\nAt the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the \"raw experience\", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV.\nAfter months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. Suddenly, most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies \u2013 were gone.\nSymbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail.\nIn response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown.\nAt first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around.\nUnable to afford international student fees of more than \u00a320,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO.\nWhen China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target.\nHer inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas.\nThe bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK, she says.\nChina has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week. \nAnother Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors.\nAnd last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances.\n\"They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,\" Chloe says.\nShe says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong.\n\"Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,\" she says. \"It's sad but we can't blame them.\"\nOn the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate \"any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas\". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK.\nBut more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster.\nIn the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: \"We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK.\" \nBut she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers.\n\"We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China.\"\nDoes she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says. \n\"When I think of what [they] face\u2026 it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas.\"\nBounty targets",

        "article_text": "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.\nUK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.\nThe MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.\nAsked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.\nThe Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.\nThe rejection of their applications was controversial because they came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.\nThe inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.\nBBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.\nThe MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.\nThe confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together.

Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.Documents disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.Special forces blocked resettlement for elite Afghan troopsMinister says Afghan commandos described 'horrific' SAS crimesSAS unit repeatedly killed Afghan detainees, BBC findsMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\". \"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".But officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.",

        "article_text": "Ordered by the Trump administration to drop a corruption case against New York's mayor, a top federal prosecutor instead resigned in protest.\nDanielle Sassoon is known as a tough but fair conservative attorney, according to former colleagues and courtroom rivals alike.\nIn 2016, Danielle Sassoon wrote a tribute to a former boss, the late US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. She praised the conservative jurist's character, and his legal approach. Such qualities were not universal, she told readers.\n\"Sometimes, when you peek behind the curtain of power, you suffer a rude awakening,\" she wrote. \"What you find is corruption, ego, or a lack of ideals and intellectual heft.\"\nOn Thursday, Sassoon, who had served just three weeks as the interim head of the Southern District of New York offered the country a peek behind that curtain of power.\nThe 38-year-old federal prosecutor resigned on Thursday, after refusing to comply with the Justice Department's order to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\nShe did not go quietly. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, which quickly became public, Sassoon said there was no legal justification for dismissing the case.\nShe made explosive allegations of a quid-pro-quo proposed by Adams' attorneys to the justice department, and said that the top official who ordered them to stop, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, had not provided sufficient legal justification for his actions.\nAdams and his attorney, Alex Spiro, have denied Sassoon's allegation. Trump himself has denied political meddling in the criminal case.\nIn her resignation letter, Sassoon wrote: \"Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations.\"\nSassoon's resignation has sparked the most public upheaval of the criminal justice system since Donald Trump took office in January. \nSix prosecutors at the justice department's criminal and public integrity unit, including its interim leaders Kevin Driscoll and John Keller, resigned as well, CBS News, BBC News' US media partner, reported. \nHagan Scotten, another federal prosecutor, wrote in his own resignation letter that he was \"entirely in agreement\" with Sassoon's decision not to drop the Adams case.\nThose who worked with Sassoon say they are not surprised she took this extraordinary stance.\nCarrie Cohen, a former colleague at the Southern District of New York, described her as \"an excellent, diligent, tough, but fair prosecutor, exactly the type of prosecutor that people should want serving their country\".\nOn Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James lauded Sassoon as a \"profile in courage\".\nEven those who worked against Sassoon's team of prosecutors in court praised her decision.\nSassoon and her team were \"fierce advocates for the office\", said criminal defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman.\n\"While I didn't always see eye to eye with them, they were fair and just,\" he said. \nIn a Fox News appearance on Friday morning, Mayor Adams called Sassoon's allegations \"silly\" and said she was accusing him of \"a crime\".\nMr Spiro called her accusations a \"lie\".\n\"We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,\" he told CBS News.\nSassoon began her legal career at Yale Law School, where she served as a features editor for the prestigious Yale Law Journal. \nIn 2013, she went to London on a Temple Bar Scholarship, where she shadowed barristers and learned the differences between the US and UK justice systems, according to an essay she wrote about her experience abroad.\nShe also served as a foreign law clerk to Justice Hanan Melcer of the Israel Supreme Court in 2009.\nSassoon won prestigious clerkships with well known conservative jurists: Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III  of the fourth circuit court of appeals, and later Scalia, perhaps the most high-profile member of the US Supreme Court at the time.\nScalia \"taught me how to fire a pistol and a rifle, and made me feel like I had grit\", Sassoon wrote in her 2016 memorial for Scotus blog. \"He thickened my skin, which was the best preparation for a career in a male-dominated field.\"\nIn her letter to the US attorney general this week, Sassoon highlighted her work for these conservatives, potentially heading off allegations that she defied the justice department for partisan reasons.\n\"Both men instilled in me a sense of duty to contribute to the public good and up hold the rule of law, and a commitment to reasoned and thorough analysis,\" she wrote to Bondi.\nSassoon joined the Southern District of New York in 2016 after stints at a white collar firm and on the faculty at New York University Law School. She is a member of the Federalist Society, a professional group of conservative lawyers and scholars.\nShe prosecuted the fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, which resulted in a guilty verdict and a sentence of 25 years in prison.\n\"There was an abundance of evidence in that case and the outcome was expected by all, but it was complex and the prosecutors were very professional, organized and cogent,\" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School who followed the case closely.\nDespite her work on such high profile cases, Sassoon kept a low profile, as is typical for federal prosecutors.\nShe was temporarily leading the Southern District of New York, while Trump's choice for the top job, Jay Clayton, awaited US Senate confirmation. \nWith her conservative bona fides, she could have potentially found work in the new Republican administration.\nBut then came Bove's instruction to drop the corruption case against Adams, who was accused of accepting bribes and improper campaign contributions from foreign nationals. \nAdams has denied the claims and pleaded not guilty. His trial was set for April.\nSassoon's decision to defy orders, and reveal secretive justice department discussions on her way out the door, was extremely unusual, Manhattan attorneys said.\n\"This is the stuff you never see,\" said Arthur Aidala, a criminal defence attorney.\nThe justice department could still take retaliatory measures. \nIn his response to Sassoon, Bove wrote that he was putting assistant US attorneys involved in the Adams case on leave pending an investigation. He also said the justice department would \"evaluate your conduct\".\nBut New York lawyers say that Sassoon's act of defiance may have sprung from necessity as much as conviction.\n\"Both from a moral perspective and a practical perspective she had no choice,\" said Mark Zauderer, a high-profile appellate attorney. \"The office would have been in shambles.\"\nTo comply with Bove could have prompted a staff exodus and put the office's reputation at risk, he said.\nMs Cohen, who still considered Sassoon a friend, said she recalled the prosecutor as a staunch advocate for her colleagues.\n\"You can see that support in her decision to put the office, and her oath of office, at the forefront of her decision to resign,\" Ms Cohen said.",

It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany of Doge's staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later said he was operating as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation is officially defined as those working for the government for 130 days or less in a year.\nTo some supporters of this new body, Doge's outsider status - as well as its somewhat vague mandate - will increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIts mission, says Musk, is to save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn).\nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nMusk has said he wants to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", what he describes as a fourth branch of government working against Trump's agenda.

They are going into agencies they disagree with,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Republican director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), told Reuters news agency.\nIt is unclear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates on what they say has been cut. Among its headline-making actions are:\n\nDoge enjoys broad popular support, a poll by the BBC's US partner CBS News has suggested. \nThis indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - supported its work, even if they disagreed over how much influence Musk should have personally.\nThe size of the permanent workforce currently exceeds two million and one of the largest increases was in 2023, partly due to major investment by the Biden administration in infrastructure projects.\nDavid Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, says Doge's work is needed. \n\"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they asking, whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\"\nPolitical opponents and government watchdogs accuse Doge of acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.\nCritics highlight Musk's potential conflicts of interest, given the billions in contracts his businesses hold with the US government. Trump and Musk deny that any issues will arise.\nMultiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans, and Democrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.\nSeveral times, the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records.\nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Musk said he expected to be scrutinised for his work, but insisted that Americans had voted for \"common sense\" government reform.\nBut pundits question whether he can enact his bold pledges.\nElaine Kamark, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told the BBC that efforts to streamline government spending \"can be done\", highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\nBut she labelled Musk's idea of slashing a third of government spending \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.\nWith additional reporting by Jessica Parker and Cai Pigliucci",

This indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - supported its work, even if they disagreed over how much influence Musk should have personally.Americans weigh up Musk's influenceThe size of the permanent workforce currently exceeds two million and one of the largest increases was in 2023, partly due to major investment by the Biden administration in infrastructure projects.David Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, says Doge's work is needed.",

        "article_text": "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"\nIf you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.\nContestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.\nIn Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.\nForced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules. \nBlind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky. \nA second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.\n\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February. \n\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"\nYet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.\n\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.\n\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"\nThe magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.\nGonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".\n\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.\nThe Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.\nSeeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.\n\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.\n\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"\nAlongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.\nA curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media. \nA previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.\nAfter Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\". \nWhen asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".\nLike Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.\nA heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints. \nDespite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.\n\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"\nTemptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.\nTake Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.\nSo is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain? \nWhen I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.\n\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.\nIn the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.\nWhen I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.\nMontoya received particular support after his beach escapade. \n\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.\nLooking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month. \nGonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\"",

This did not work and it was Merino's arrival and accomplished finishing with both goals in the 2-0 win, that has given Arteta very palatable food for thought and kept the Gunners firmly in the title hunt.\nWilliam Saliba offered himself up as a potential striker solution after Kai Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring injury on Arsenal's sunshine break to Dubai, but this was not an option given his high-class quality in defence.\nArteta suggested another defender, Riccardo Calafiori, might be in the frame and the Italian has shown an eye for a goal - but Merino has made his case in Arsenal's state of emergency, scoring twice in a game for the first time since 2016.\nIt was a tactical switch that had a touch of desperation as well as improvisation, but Arteta and Merino must take the credit as Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 15 games in the Premier League - 10 wins and five draws. It is their best run since going 16 games unbeaten between December 2010 and April 2011 under Arsene Wenger.\nA delighted Arteta said: \"Mikel has a sense of danger and great timing in the box. We were composed, scored two brilliant goals and could have scored one or two more.\"\nHe added: \"He has got a goal threat. He can smell danger. He can anticipate the action. He's got really good timing to arrive in certain areas and execute.\n\"We are going to have various contexts and we are prepared. We have to have the pictures in our heads for these scenarios. We have to see where the game is and what is demanded. In this game we believed it was him. The hardest thing then is to deliver and he did.\n\"I think the game started to suit him more because Leicester started to defend much deeper. We had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period. And we believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it.\"\nMerino's late double keeps Arsenal title pursuit on track at Leicester\nSaturday's Premier League action and reaction\nThis video can not be played\nWithout a doubt Arsenal's bright spark - Shearer on Nwaneri\nThe 6ft 2in Merino's height and stature make him an obvious threat and so it proved. He stole in to head home powerfully from Ethan Nwaneri's right-wing cross with nine minutes left, before finishing with confidence after 87 minutes to wrap up the win that leaves Arsenal four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool having played a game more.\nThe player himself played down the notion he might figure more as a striker, but on this evidence Arteta may give him no say in the matter as he makes his plans without Havertz and Gabriel Jesus until next season.\nMerino said when asked about starting as a striker: \"I don't think so to be honest. It is certainly the first time I have scored two coming off the bench as a striker.\"\nHe told BBC Match Of The Day: \"It was big news for me this morning when one of the assistants told me this was an option. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do.\n\"Mikel told me to use my strengths in the box and I was in the right place at the right time. I've not trained there once but I know what everyone has to do on the pitch. Tactically, we are a rich team and I just tried to emulate all the guys who are out injured.\"\nIf Merino, justifiably, grabbed the headlines, it was 17-year-old Nwaneri who was Arsenal's overall inspiration with a superb performance of skill, confidence, pace and maturity.\nNwaneri delivered the inviting cross for Merino's opener, having previously hit the woodwork twice in Arsenal's only serious moments of threat before those late goals.\nArteta was lavish in his praise of Nwaneri, as well as his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, who ensured Arsenal stayed on level terms by applying a vital touch to Jordan Ayew's cross with Bobby de Cordova-Reid waiting to tap in a simple finish at the far post with the scoreline goalless.\nHe said: \"Physically they are built in a really special way already. Emotionally and mentally, how composed they are, and how they make decisions on the pitch are really impressive, so let them go.\"\nArsenal's nerves and anxiety were mounting until Merino stepped into the breach, the lack of a serious central threat obvious as every attempt floundered near goal with Leicester City holding firm.\nIn among that pre-Merino mediocrity, it was a dismal day for Sterling, who struggled to do a thing right and looked short of confidence and the old pace before Arteta decided he had seen enough.\nSterling looked crestfallen as he walked off, another opportunity missed for the 30-year-old former England forward to show he can still be a going concern at this level as he continues to struggle at Arsenal after being marginalised by Chelsea.\nNo such problems for Merino, who has not had a full effect in midfield since his Arsenal arrival but may now have the chance to do so further forward as Arteta looks to solve his most pressing problem.\nAnd there was a touch of belated romance about Merino's heroics and Arsenal's win as the Spain midfielder said: \"I forgot to give my wife something for Valentine's Day so this goes to her.

No casualties were reported, the agency added.\nThe agency remains on \"high alert\" after the incident, with its director general Rafael Grossi saying there is \"no room for complacency\". \nMr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\". \nA catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.\nWhile the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.\nThe radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.\nZelensky posted footage on X appearing to show damage to the giant shield, made of concrete and steel, which covers the remains of the reactor that lost its roof in the explosion.\n\"Another 15 metres [50ft] to the side and there would have been a radiation accident,\" Hryhoriy Ishchenko, chief of the agency that manages the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, told reporters, according to local media.\nSince 1990, Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, while he admits the strike was a \"horrendous attack on a very important structure\", he is \"not concerned\" about the radiation risk.\nProf Smith told the BBC a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" below the damaged outer shield covers radioactive particles and dust from the explosion. \nSimon Evans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was head of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, which oversaw the construction of the protective dome in the 2010s.\nHe described the apparent strike as \"an incredibly reckless attack on a vulnerable nuclear facility\". \nThe shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.\nThe strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.\nThere appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.\nMr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.\n\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.\nZelensky claimed the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"definitely not preparing for negotiations\", after US President Donald Trump said Putin had agreed to begin talks to end the war earlier this week.\nThe incident at Chernobyl comes after increased military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, the IAEA said. \nIn December, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching a drone attack on a convoy of vehicles transporting IAEA experts heading to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear station.\nThe agency last year urged restraint when an attack on Zaporizhzhia raised the risk of a \"major nuclear incident\". Russia and Ukraine traded blame over the attack in August.\n\"I'm more concerned about Zaporizhzhia than Chernobyl,\" Prof Smith said. \n\"The reactors [at Zaporizhzhia] are currently shut down but there is more live fuel there. Chernobyl is still very radioactive, but it's not in a 'hot state' because of its age.\"\nThe number of people who died in the Chernobyl disaster remains disputed. \nAccording to the official, internationally recognised death toll, just 31 people died as an immediate result of Chernobyl while the UN estimates that 50 deaths can be directly attributed to the disaster. \nIn 2005, it predicted a further 4,000 might eventually die as a result of the radiation exposure.",

If untreated, it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis C cause inflammation of the liver and come from viral infections, according to the NHS. Both can be contracted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.  \nOpt-out testing for blood-borne viruses has been seen by health officials and ministers as a resounding success for the NHS, which has not yet released the names of the latest hospitals added to the scheme.\nThe BBC understands health leaders hope to expand opt-out testing to detect more diseases in the future. \nSean Connaughton, from London, told the BBC he would \"have been dead\" had it not been for the opt-out testing. \nHe is one of the hundreds of people to discover they were living with HIV after being diagnosed through the scheme.\nHe attended hospital in October 2023 after suffering from seizures and losing 20kg (44lbs) through repeated sickness.\n\"Unless I had gone to A&E and I had done that test, my diagnosis would never have been known,\" Mr Connaughton said.\nWithout a diagnosis, doctors told him \"some of the other infections I had would have gone into my spine and into my brain\", he told the BBC.\n\"Two days prior to being admitted, I'd had a seizure in the bathroom and smashed my head into the basin and passed out, so the body was already breaking at that point. \n\"I wouldn't have survived, I don't think, another couple of weeks, if I hadn't been tested.\"\nRichard Angell, the chief executive of sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said opt-out testing was a \"win-win for everyone\".\n\"The benefit of opt-out testing is that you can get a test to people that would otherwise never come forward for a HIV test,\" Mr Angell said.\nHe added \"that means a transformation for the individual\" who can begin to take medication, which \"means the virus is no longer attacking their immune system and they can't pass it on if they're having sex or having a baby\".\nMr Angell said early testing also makes \"good money sense for the NHS\" as it allows early treatment, which stops HIV progressing, preventing severe illness, emergency visits and more costly treatments.\nThe testing forms part of a pledge by Sir Keir Starmer to eliminate new transmissions of HIV by 2030.\nEarlier this week, Sir Keir became the first sitting prime minister to publicly take an HIV test.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues. \nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model. They've got some outstanding young German coaches. We have one coaching our national team, which is fantastic.\n\"What you see - and this is over the last 10 years - is that they have younger coaches who have been given opportunities in the Bundesliga.\n\"They've been more exposed to that level earlier, so maybe that's something we can look at. But, for me, it's not about the nationality of a manager, it's about the qualities that they bring.\"\nWith just 20 managerial spots available does the Premier League feel a bit of a closed shop?\n\"Sometimes,\" says Still. \"But it's difficult to sort of have a grasp or a proper sense of what the reality is.\n\"I don't know what those Premier League clubs are thinking. I don't know how they're working. I don't know what their next step in their recruitment process is.\n\"It's the best league in the world for a reason so you've got to be one of the best in the world and that's what I think we all aspire to do.\"\nRosenior sees it somewhat differently.\n\"I think it depends on what your ultimate goal is,\" he says. \"My ultimate goal isn't to be in the Premier League.\n\"I don't think football is a linear thing where you say, 'Right, I worked in the Championship, I'm going to go to the Premier League'.\n\"My ultimate goal is to be the best coach I can be and it's up to the decision makers at each football club to pick who they think the right coach is for their club.\"\nThere was a time when few British players ventured overseas, but the numbers are growing season upon season. Should British coaches seek to do similar?\n\"I think it's a great experience,\" says Still \"I think learning about different cultures, different ways of playing the game, different opposition, different players. I'd definitely encourage it because you open yourself up to a lot more.\"\nRosenior adds: \"It's not for me to say to anyone where they should take their careers. And it's not about nationality. It's just about being the best person you can be and working as hard as you can every day.\"\nBoth Rosenior and Still have worked exceptionally hard to get to where they are right now in their careers and the decisions they have made have set them on a collision course which will culminate, temporarily at least, at Lens' Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Sunday.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Zakaria is 11 years old and lives in Gaza. He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.\nBut at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.\nAs a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.\nMoments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.\nSeveral of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)",

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. \n\"I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.\nOn Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.\nIn outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.\nWhile big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.\nThe memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days. \nTrump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April. \nTrump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.\n\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".\n\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"\nAs well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports. \nTrump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.\nStill, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"\nIn recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.\nAhead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".\n\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good. \nCountries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nHistorically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium. \nThe US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.\nIn setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US. \nThe White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.\nBut officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax. \nThose kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK. \nDuncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus. \n\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said. \n\nThursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration. \nEarlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.\nHe also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March. \nShares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced. \nJohn Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".\nBut he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy. \n\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.\nHowever, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves. \nHe does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation. \n\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said. \nHe noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.\n\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.\nTrump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.\n\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"\nBut surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households. \nA recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats. \n\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".\nReporting contributed by Tom Espiner",

        "article_text": "Despite the hype, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Washington under Donald Trump's second term was a sober, business-first affair - unsurprising for a working visit, which lacks the pomp of a state visit.\nTrump announced expanded US military sales to India from 2025, including F-35 jets, along with increased oil and gas exports to narrow the trade deficit. Both sides agreed to negotiate a trade deal and finalise a new defence framework. \nHe also confirmed the US had approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman accused of playing a role in the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai.\n\"That's a lot of deliverables for an administration less than a month old,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington told the BBC\n\"Overall, both sides seem comfortable continuing Biden-era collaborations, particularly in tech and defence, though many will be rebranded under Trump.\"\nStill, major challenges lie ahead. Here are the key takeaways:\nModi's visit came as Trump ordered that US trading partners should face reciprocal tariffs - tit-for-tat import taxes to match similar duties already charged by those countries on American exports. He ordered advisers to draft broad new tariffs on US trade partners, warning they could take effect by 1 April.\nIndia enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. India cut average tariffs from 13% to 11% in its federal budget in a bid to pre-empt Trump's tariff moves. \nThe jury is out on whether India appears to have dodged tariff shocks for now.\nAjay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI), says he doesn't see any \"problems with tariffs\".\nThe main reason, he says, is that 75% of the US exports to India attract import taxes of less than 5%.\n\"Trump points to extreme outlier tariffs like 150% on select items, but that's not the norm. India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.\nAbhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced.\n\"The devil lies in the details. Reciprocal tariffs won't just mirror India's import taxes -other factors will come into play,\" he told the BBC.\nTrump's approach could go beyond import duties, factoring in value added tax (VAT), non-tariff barriers and trade restrictions. While India's goods and services tax (GST) on imported goods aligns with WTO rules, Trump may still use it to justify higher tariffs.\nA US government memo on reciprocal tariffs hints at this strategy, citing costs to American businesses from non-tariff barriers, subsidies and burdensome regulations abroad. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.\nMr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected under WTO rules. \n\"This will hamper India's ability to prioritise domestic producers, posing a direct challenge to the 'Make in India' initiative. This is certainly not good news for us.\" \nMr Das suggests that India should counter Trump's reciprocal tariff logic, particularly in agriculture where the US imposes strict non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian exports such as stiff maximum residue limits on chemicals. \nHe argues that since the US \"heavily subsidises\" its farm sector, India should highlight these subsidies to push back against American claims.\nTariffs alone may not help bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. Defence and energy purchases will go some way in addressing the deficit, experts say.\nThe new $500bn (\u00a3400bn) trade goal aims to more than double the $190bn trade between the two countries in 2023.\nModi and Trump committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. Talks will focus on market access, tariff reductions and supply chain integration across goods and services.\n\"The announcement that the two sides will pursue a trade deal gives India an opportunity to negotiate for reduced tariffs on both sides. That would be a boon not only for the US-India relationship, but also for an Indian economy that's sputtered in recent months,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nWhat is not clear is what kind of trade deal the both sides will be aiming at.\n\"What is this trade agreement? Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?\" wonders Mr Srivastava. \nMr Das believes we'll have to wait for details on the trade agreement. \n\"It doesn't necessarily mean a free trade deal - if that were the case, it would have been stated explicitly. It could simply involve tariff reductions on select products of mutual interest.\"\nPriyanka Kishore, principal economist at the Singapore-based consultancy firm, Asia Decoded, says $500bn is a \"tall target but there are low hanging fruit we can immediately exploit\".\n\"For instance the US sanctions on Russian shadow fleet are soon going to kick in, so India can easily pivot to the US for more oil. This will not be too difficult.\"\nTrump said at the joint press conference that the US would hopefully become India's number one supplier of oil and gas. \nIndia's defence trade with the US has surged from near zero to $20 billion, making the US its third-largest arms supplier. \nWhile Russia remains India's top source, its share has dropped from 62% to 34% (2017-2023) as India shifts toward US procurement.\nIn a major announcement to deepen defence ties, Trump said the US would increase military equipment sales to India \"by many billions of dollars starting this year\" ultimately paving the way to providing the F-35 stealth warplanes.\nBut this will be easier said than done, say experts.\n\"This sounds good, but it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nDespite rising US arms sales to India, bureaucratic hurdles and export controls limit the transfer of sensitive technologies, he says. The new defence framework announced at the summit may help address these challenges.\nAlso India isn't \"taking the F-35 offer seriously\" due to high maintenance demands, says strategic affairs expert Ajai Shukla. \nShukla notes that US arms deals come with challenges - private firms prioritise profit over long-term partnerships. \nYet with delays and cost overruns affecting some of India's arms deals with Russia, Delhi's defence ties with the US look set to deepen.\nModi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss AI and emerging tech, India's foreign ministry said.\nIt's unclear if they addressed Musk's stalled plans for Starlink's India launch or Tesla's market entry. \nMusk has pushed for direct spectrum allocation, clashing with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who favours auctions.

Tesla has yet to confirm its plans.\nIn a rare move, Modi joined Trump at a press conference, answering two questions - on illegal immigration and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) bribery charges against the Adani Group.\nIndian billionaire Gautam Adani, accused of close ties with Modi, was charged with fraud in the US last November over an alleged $250m bribery scheme. \nModi said he hadn't discussed the issue with Trump. On immigration, he stated India was ready to take back verified illegal Indian migrants.\nThis was only Modi's third direct press Q&A in his almost 11-year tenure as India's prime minister. He has never held a solo press conference. In 2019 he sat beside then party president Amit Shah as Shah answered all the questions and in 2023, he took just two questions alongside former President Joe Biden.",

India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced.

        "article_text": "A lawsuit against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Jay-Z, which alleged the rape of a 13-year-old girl in 2000, has been dismissed, according to a legal filing submitted on Friday in New York.\nThe attorney representing the anonymous plaintiff, referred to as Jane Doe, voluntarily withdrew the case, court records show.\nThe filing was submitted by lawyer Tony Buzbee, who is representing dozens of plaintiffs in lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct against Mr Combs.\nThe filings states that the plaintiff \"hereby gives notice that the... action is voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice\". \nBecause the dismissal is with prejudice, the lawsuit cannot again be refiled in its current form.\nRoc Nation, the entertainment company founded by Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, issued a statement signed by him, referring to the dismissal as a \"victory\".\n\"The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed,\" he wrote.\n\"This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims.\"\n\"The trauma that my wife, my children, loved ones and I have endured can never be dismissed,\" said the rapper, who is married to singer Beyonc\u00e9.\nHe continued: \"The courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence.

She alleged that both men assaulted her in 2000 after an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty.\nJay-Z strongly denied the allegations, claiming that his attorney had been sent \"blackmail\" in an attempt to force a settlement. He said the attempt had the \"opposite effect\" and instead motivated him to publicly challenge the accusations.\nIn December, Jane Doe gave an interview that raised questions about her credibility. She admitted that \"not all the facts are clear\" and stated, \"I have made some mistakes. I may have made a mistake in identifying.\"\nLast month, Jay-Z formally requested the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing inconsistencies in the accuser's account. The request was approved by United States District Judge Analisa Torres, leading to the lawsuit's dismissal.\nWhile Jay-Z is no longer facing legal action in this case, Mr Combs continues to battle over three dozen civil suits.\nIn response to Friday's dismissal, Mr Combs' legal team issued a statement declaring his innocence.\n\"For months, we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity, pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit.

America is still in Nato but Europe can no longer automatically rely on the US to come to its aid.\nIn Brussels, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Nato's European members to spend much more on defence, saying they would have to provide the \"overwhelming\" share of military funding for Ukraine.\nThe US and Russia are going to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, whether Europe and Ukraine like it or not. \nThe talks in Saudi Arabia will end a three-year freeze in talking to Vladimir Putin, despite urgent warnings by Kyiv that the Russian leader is not to be trusted.\nThey follow a phone call between Donald Trump and Putin on Wednesday.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, US officials said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly said he would not accept any deal struck without his country's input, said Kyiv had not been invited to the talks.\nEurope, everyone agrees, needs to rapidly raise its defence spending if it has any hope of deterring a newly emboldened Russia. \nThe current Nato-mandated minimum of 2% of GDP is likely to rise to 3%. Russia currently spends more than twice that on defence in percentage terms.\nIn January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income on defence. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending.\nBut Europe as a whole has already overtaken the US in terms of aid to Ukraine. In total, it has allocated \u20ac70bn ($73bn; \u00a358bn) in financial and humanitarian aid as well as \u20ac62bn in military aid. This compares to \u20ac64bn in military aid from the US as well as \u20ac50bn in financial and humanitarian allocations.\nUS Vice President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on Friday was called \"ill-judged\" and \"insulting\" by many of the delegates at the Munich Security Conference. \nThey had hoped he would reassure them the US was not abandoning Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. \nBut the speech appealed to others on both sides of the Atlantic and Donald Trump  called it \"brilliant\".\nWhile the Munich conference was occupied by the geopolitical, Donald Trump announced plans to bring in a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from March.\nIt was evidence there are now very obvious rifts between Washington's positions and Europe's on several issues, from trade to dealing with Russia. \nIt is a divide that the UK is struggling to bridge, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling reporters both relationships were important and Britain was \"not choosing between the US and the EU\". \nBut the Trump team's own messaging is sometimes contradictory, rowing back on grand pronouncements the day after they have been made.",

        "article_text": "There can be \"no durable peace\" in Ukraine without European nations, particularly Ukraine, taking part in talks to end the war with Russia, the UK business secretary has told the BBC.\nJonathan Reynolds downplayed divisions between the US and its allies over resolving the conflict, following concerns over the Trump administration moving ahead with peace talks that would lock out European countries, including Ukraine. \nIn response, European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, will meet in Paris on Monday, while US officials prepare to meet Russian negotiators separately.\nReynolds told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the UK could act as a \"bridge\" between the US and Europe.\nReynolds also told the programme, hosted by Victoria Derbyshire, that the UK and Europe had to respond to US demands for them to pay more towards their \"collective defence\" in the face of \"greater threats\". \nHe said the UK government would set out a roadmap to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national output, but declined to offer a definitive timetable. \nThe Trump administration has called on Nato allies to raise defence spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP), and has said in the past week that it will no longer primarily be focused on European security.\nPressed on whether the 2.5% figure would be sufficient, Reynolds said any decision on further increases would take threats to national security into account.\nAsked if the threat had \"just got bigger without the US\", he said there was \"no doubt\" it had.\nFormer head of the Army Lord Dannatt has joined calls for Labour to go beyond its target of 2.5%, warning on Saturday the UK military was \"too run down\" to lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine.\nHowever, Ministry of Defence sources told the BBC the priority was setting a date for when 2.5% would be reached, adding that would be the first time the UK had spent that much on defence since the last Labour government. \nReynolds said he thought the UK could \"play a constructive role\" as a bridge  between the US and Europe \"as we adjust to this new era - and it certainly is a new era\".\nBut he added that there had not been a \"fundamental breach\" in relations and there was \"still a great deal of common ground\". \nThe business secretary did concede it would not \"be easy [as] there's a very assertive agenda from the US\".\nAsked what he made of the UK and European nations not being invited to the US-Russian talks, Reynolds said US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had made clear that \"everything is still on the table\". \n\"We shouldn't rule out potential outcomes,\" he added. \nHe argued Europe and Ukraine would have to be involved for any peace settlement to be lasting. \n\"Ultimately [President Trump] is somebody who likes to win, and winning would not be rewarding a war of aggression.\"\nSir Keir said on Saturday that the emergency summit in Paris was a \"once-in-a-generation moment for our national security\" and that it was clear Europe must take a greater role in Nato.\nHe added that the UK would work \"to keep the US and Europe together\" and could not allow divisions between the two to distract from \"external enemies\".\nPlans for the summit came after Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said European leaders would be consulted but would not take part in any talks between US and Russia over ending the war.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the meeting should not be \"over-dramatised\".\nSenior White House figures are due to meet Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia in the coming days. US officials said that Ukraine had also been invited - though President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has received no such invitation.\nConservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told Victoria Derbyshire it was \"too premature to make assumptions\" about the way the peace talks were heading.\n\"We all have to have very, very cold and calm heads right now, primarily because this conflict is still raging.\"\nShe said Ukrainians should be the ones to determine their future because the war was about their \"independence and sovereignty\". \nAsked if she supported President Trump's proposal that Ukraine give up territory to end the conflict, she said: \"We have to understand in more detail what they are saying, it's too easy to generalise.\n\"It's very early days in those talks, and I think right now, the United Kingdom, along with Nato allies, we must continue to be firm and solid and strong in that support we're giving.\" \nDame Priti added that as a priority, the UK needed to step up its spending on defence.  \nAppearing on the same programme, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said it was \"no surprise\" Trump and his team were taking \"a completely different\" approach by putting \"everything up for grabs\" in terms of Ukraine.\nHe described it as a \"massive wake-up call\" for European leaders to take responsibility for their own defence.  \nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Ukraine had to be \"at the front and centre\" of any peace talks.  \nHe warned that the Trump administration's moves could leave Ukraine and the rest of Europe \"at risk of future Russian aggression\". \nKarin von Hippel, former director at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said she did not think Trump would \"sell Ukraine down the river\" and European nations should \"stay calm\".\nMeanwhile, Conservative former Prime Minister Sir John Major has warned that democracy was under threat as the US steps back from its role as a world leader.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that Trump's policy of \"isolation\" was creating a power vacuum which would embolden countries like Russia and China to fill it.\nSir John said: \"Many of the gains we made over recent years, when the Soviet Union collapsed, are now being reversed and you see a very aggressive Russia again in Ukraine.\n\"And if they were to succeed with their venture in Ukraine, no doubt they'd be elsewhere before too long.\"",

The Trump administration has called on Nato allies to raise defence spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP), and has said in the past week that it will no longer primarily be focused on European security.Pressed on whether the 2.5% figure would be sufficient, Reynolds said any decision on further increases would take threats to national security into account.Asked if the threat had \"just got bigger without the US\", he said there was \"no doubt\" it had.Former head of the Army Lord Dannatt has joined calls for Labour to go beyond its target of 2.5%, warning on Saturday the UK military was \"too run down\" to lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine.However, Ministry of Defence sources told the BBC the priority was setting a date for when 2.5% would be reached, adding that would be the first time the UK had spent that much on defence since the last Labour government. The business secretary did concede it would not \"be easy [as] there's a very assertive agenda from the US\".Asked what he made of the UK and European nations not being invited to the US-Russian talks, Reynolds said US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had made clear that \"everything is still on the table\". US officials said that Ukraine had also been invited - though President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has received no such invitation.Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told Victoria Derbyshire it was \"too premature to make assumptions\" about the way the peace talks were heading.",

You're entitled to your opinion.\nBut what's not in doubt is that they all went viral on YouTube, which is now 20 years old.\nIt's become the place where 2.5 billion people log on monthly to kill time, be entertained and, sometimes at least, learn something.\nBut it's also been life-changing for some of its breakout stars, like Charlie.\nYou wouldn't recognise him now but millions around the world have watched him, as a baby, chomping on his big brother's digits. \nThat's because he's the star of Charlie Bit My Finger.\n\"It was never not a part of my life, it's always been there,\" Charlie, who's now 18, tells BBC Newsbeat.\nThe 55-second clip has had almost 900 million views since it was uploaded in 2007.\nCharlie says he can't remember the moment, filmed when he was \"about one\" and sitting on Harry's lap.\nHe says the clip's success has made life \"easier\" and helped him get to university where he now studies law.\nHis dad Howard Davies-Carr previously told Newsbeat the family had made an estimated \u00a31,000,000 off the video over the years.\nThe video was sold as a non-fungible token, or NFT, for \u00a3500,000 in 2021.\nBut Mr Davies-Carr said he wanted to keep the boys \"very grounded\" in how they live their lives.\nCharlie shares that view and says he doesn't play the \"don't you know who I am?\" card.\n\"It's not like I use it as an icebreaker or anything,\" he says. \n\"I was never going to use this as a fun fact.\"\nCharlie says he doesn't want to be seen as a show-off, so when asked about himself volunteers \"something else a bit more boring\".\n\"But my friends like to tell people [sometimes], so it's hard keeping it locked down,\" says. \n\"It slips out every now and then.\n\"And people are like: 'Oh that's cool', for like five minutes. Or they say: 'I don't know what that is.'\"\nYouTube was founded on 14 February 2005 by three friends - Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim - all former employees of the online payment system PayPal.\nWhile the first video published on 23 April 2005 was not quite Baby Shark, it did have an animal theme. \nIt was a 19-second clip called Me at the zoo, posted by co-founder Jawed.\nThe founders opened the first YouTube headquarters in an office above a California pizza restaurant.\nIt is now owned by Google and has offices all over the world.\nIn the UK, 82% of adult internet users in the UK have reported using the platform - more than WhatsApp (80%), Facebook (76%) and Instagram (57%).\nNow YouTube is a destination many choose for the latest trailers, reviews and news.\nBut it is music videos which dominate the most-viewed list, with Baby Shark Dance having more than 15 billion watches.\nDespacito by Luis Fonsi has more than eight billion, Shape of You by Ed Sheeran has more than six billion views and PSY's Gangnam Style has 5.4 billion.\nAnd while Charlie's family has been helped by income from YouTube, some of its biggest names have made a fortune.\nAmerican YouTuber MrBeast, a.k.a Jimmy Donaldson, is the most popular YouTuber with more than 360 million subscribers.\nBusiness magazine Forbes estimates that he earned $85 million (\u00a368 million) in 2024, making him the highest-paid creator.\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing in the platform's two decades.\nFact-checking organisations around the world have previously said that YouTube is not doing enough to prevent misinformation on the platform.\nThe site has also been punished for privacy violations, being fined $170m (\u00a3139m) by a US regulator for violating children's privacy laws.\nIn 2023, it was accused of collecting the viewing data of children aged under 13, in breach of a UK data privacy code.\nAnd there has been criticism that, like other online platforms, violent and extremist videos have been available to view despite government calls for their removal.\nJournalist Tamzin Kraftman, who covers technology news, feels while the platform has managed to stay relevant against competition from TikTok and Instagram, there are challenges with combating things like misinformation.\n\"No team can go through everything with a fine-toothed comb,\" she says.\n\"So the question is how they will ensure everything on there is correct and within regulations.\"\nTamzin tells Newsbeat AI could play a big role in helping to deal with those issues, but \"might get things wrong and could ban the wrong channel\".\n\"I think it's how they use new tools to really stop the spread of misinformation that is going to be their golden ticket [going forward].\"\nAnd Charlie doesn't think the platform is \"dying out\" any time soon, years on from his flutter with fame.\nWhile he doesn't remember loads from then, he is grateful for the opportunities it has brought.\nHe has managed to travel \"a decent amount\" and been to the United States, filming a flight-safety video.\nAs for whether he's tried to recreate the bite?\n\"I haven't since I was very young.\n\"I could start charging now.

He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn \u00a320.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. The release clause can be triggered for \u00a3145m before the final year of his contract and then goes down to \u00a383m.\nJust last week, it was revealed Kane also possesses certain release clauses that can be triggered before the respective ends of the January transfer windows to initiate a move for the summer.\nAs valuable as the England captain has been in his role as Bayern's top-notch goalscorer, the 31-year-old is obviously not seen as a long-term solution for Bayern, with an eventual return to the Premier League - where Kane could eventually break Alan Shearer's goalscoring record - appearing likely.\nMeanwhile, Musiala is 10 years younger than Kane and the perfect representative for Bayern, who have always been anxious to assemble the best German players, mixed with a number of high-profile talents from abroad.\nMusiala has already created countless moments of magic for Bayern, including his championship-clinching goal against Cologne in May 2023, when the team snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund during the final minutes of the season.\nMusiala played for England's youth teams but opted to represent Germany, the country of his birth\nWhen Musiala misses games or can only play a limited number of minutes due to an injury, his absence has been felt as the team does not look the same at all.\nBayern's 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Uefa Champions League earlier this season was a prime example.\nMusiala himself has talked about how he can be almost obsessed with improving his game through repetition and specialised training, for example practising certain shooting positions and movements.\n\"I just try to do everything that can take me to the next level,\" he said in 2023. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.\n\"I try to start at a young age with nutrition, the extra work so I can have more stamina, and then season by season, hopefully I get better.\"\nThere can be no doubt he has improved, instead of just resting on his natural talent as a footballer, and can do even further to put his name high among the world's best players in the future.\nIt is the reason why Musiala has just signed the most lucrative contract extension in German Bundesliga history.\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'",

They had, after all, won the battle of Kyiv and liberated swathes of territory elsewhere.\nBut 18 months on, thunder-like artillery exchanges reflect the failure of that operation, and Russia's dominance.\nThe front line here is broadly in the same place - but the broad expanse of river has gone.\nWhen the Russian-occupied Kakhovka dam downstream was destroyed, this became a vast, uninterrupted expanse of scrubland.\nThe barren surroundings reflect the frozen limbo in which Ukraine finds itself. The White House wants to end the war, but it's not as simple as blowing a full-time whistle.\n\"If the front line becomes a border, it would be scary\u2026 fighting could break out at any moment,\" explains Oleksandr.\nThe exposed riverbed separates our location from Russian-occupied territory.

He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn \u00a320.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. The release clause can be triggered for \u00a3145m before the final year of his contract and then goes down to \u00a383m.\nJust last week, it was revealed Kane also possesses certain release clauses that can be triggered before the respective ends of the January transfer windows to initiate a move for the summer.\nAs valuable as the England captain has been in his role as Bayern's top-notch goalscorer, the 31-year-old is obviously not seen as a long-term solution for Bayern, with an eventual return to the Premier League - where Kane could eventually break Alan Shearer's goalscoring record - appearing likely.\nMeanwhile, Musiala is 10 years younger than Kane and the perfect representative for Bayern, who have always been anxious to assemble the best German players, mixed with a number of high-profile talents from abroad.\nMusiala has already created countless moments of magic for Bayern, including his championship-clinching goal against Cologne in May 2023, when the team snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund during the final minutes of the season.\nMusiala played for England's youth teams but opted to represent Germany, the country of his birth\nWhen Musiala misses games or can only play a limited number of minutes due to an injury, his absence has been felt as the team does not look the same at all.\nBayern's 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Uefa Champions League earlier this season was a prime example.\nMusiala himself has talked about how he can be almost obsessed with improving his game through repetition and specialised training, for example practising certain shooting positions and movements.\n\"I just try to do everything that can take me to the next level,\" he said in 2023. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.\n\"I try to start at a young age with nutrition, the extra work so I can have more stamina, and then season by season, hopefully I get better.\"\nThere can be no doubt he has improved, instead of just resting on his natural talent as a footballer, and can do even further to put his name high among the world's best players in the future.\nIt is the reason why Musiala has just signed the most lucrative contract extension in German Bundesliga history.\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'",

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.",

        "article_text": "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the latest move in a row between the Trump administration and career US attorneys. \nSeven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case. \nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News on Friday that it was her understanding that the case against Adams would be \"dismissed today\". \nAdams was indicted last year on fraud and bribery charges. He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe request to drop the charges will require approval by a judge.\nEarlier in the week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove - Bondi's second-in-command - ordered the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office to end the case.\nBove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. \nThe motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case \"would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies\".\nBut several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.   \nSassoon resigned from her post on Thursday and was followed by six of her colleagues.\nShe said dropping the case would set a \"breathtaking and dangerous precedent\".\nThe latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for \"using prosecutorial power\" to influence elected officials.\n\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\nIn a letter accepting Sassoon's resignation, Bove said his office would be investigating the attorney, claiming she had \"lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice\". \nIn a statement, Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle defended the decision to dismiss the charges, saying it showed \"that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\".\nMr Mizelle said that prosecutors who refuse direct orders \"have no place\" in the department.\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. \nIn Sassoon's resignation letter, she also said  Adams' lawyers had met justice department officials and asked for a \"quid pro quo\", saying the New York City mayor could help enforce Trump's immigration policies if the case against him was dismissed.\nBut Adams denied that was the case. \n\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered - nor did anyone offer on my behalf - any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\nAdams, a Democrat, has accused investigators of pursuing a politically motivated case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\nThe New York mayor has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he won the White House. He flew to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida days before the Republican president took office. \nAfter a meeting with US border tsar Tom Homan on Thursday, Adams said he would agree to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to re-establish an office at the city's Rikers Island jail. \nTrump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the case against Adams. \nBut Bove's letter described his instructions to drop the case as \"direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\".\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.\nWhile she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was \"consulting with other leaders in government at this time\". \n\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious,\" she said. \"But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction.\"",

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.",

        "article_text": "Sainz (right) joined Williams after he lost his seat at Ferrari to Lewis Hamilton\nWilliams drivers Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon say it is wrong to threaten Formula 1 drivers with bans for swearing.\nSainz, who has moved to Williams from Ferrari, said he did not agree with the move by governing body the FIA to codify a system that can mean drivers are fined or suspended for swearing or criticising officials.\nAlbon, who is entering his fourth season with the team, added that the drivers had already spoken privately about how to respond to the move.\n\"There have definitely been discussions about it,\" Albon said. \"It's still ongoing about how we want to set out what we say around it. It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings. They already tell us what to say on the radio.\n\"But when you hear that passion, those words, even if sometimes we swear on the radio, for me that's a keeper in F1 and it is something we shouldn't get rid of.\"\nThe FIA has not explained how the new system will be applied, but last year president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said he wanted to stop drivers swearing while driving.\nSainz said the drivers have not had any clarification from the FIA.\nHe and Albon both drove Williams' new 2025 car as it was unveiled at Silverstone on Friday.\nVerstappen restricts answers after 'ridiculous' swearing punishment\nFerrari's Leclerc fined for swearing in news conference\nF1 drivers ask FIA to treat them like adults\nSainz explained that his first impressions were \"positive\", and he said Williams' willingness to host a day for media and sponsors and give the car its debut at the same time was indicative of the progress the team had made.\nLast year, the team struggled at the start of the season as attempts to introduce new processes in the team delayed the car build. A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

        "article_text": "Even after 5,000 years in a sarcophagus, mummified bodies from ancient Egypt still smell quite nice, scientists have discovered.\nResearchers who examined nine mummies found that though there was some difference in the intensity of their odours, all could be described as \"woody\", \"spicy\" and \"sweet\".\nThey say recreating the composition of the smells chemically will allow others to experience a mummy's whiff - and help to tell when the bodies inside may be starting to rot.\n\"We want to share the experience we had smelling the mummified bodies, so we're reconstructing the smell to be presented in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo,\" Cecilia Bembibre, one of the researchers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nDuring the mummification process, ancient Egyptians would surround the body with pleasant smells as an important part of preparing a spirit to enter the afterlife. \nAs a result, pharaohs and members of the nobility were adorned with oils, waxes and balms during the mummification process. \n\"In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,\" said Dr Bembibre said. \n\"We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.\"\nThe authors of the academic study, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on Thursday, had to get the smell from inside the sarcophagus without interfering with the mummy inside. \nThe researchers, from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, did so by inserting a tiny tube so they were able measure the scent without taking any physical samples. \nDr Bembibre explained that heritage scientists are always trying to find \"non-destructive\" ways to discover new information. \nVisitors who smell the scents in the museums will be able to experience ancient Egypt and the mummification process from a totally different perspective. \nAlly Louks, an English literature supervisor at the University of Cambridge who wrote her PhD thesis on the politics of smell, described this as a \"really innovative\" way to communicate history. \n\"To engage your nose produces a strong emotional and physical reaction,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We know smells were essential to social, religious and personal practises [in ancient Egypt],\" Dr Louks said. \nMatija Strli\u010d, another member of the study team, told the Associated Press the scents may even suggest what social class a mummy was from.\n\"We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections,\" he said. \nAs well as providing museum-goers with a new sensory insight into mummies, the discovery also presents a potential breakthrough for mummy conservationists.\nThe researchers used a technique called gas chromatography to separate the different smells inside the sarcophagus that combined to make its scent. \nThey found odours relating to the break-down of animal fats used in the embalming process, which could indicate the body is beginning to decompose.\nBecause of these findings, it will be possible to \"practically intervene\" in the conservation of the mummies, identifying how best to store and wrap the bodies, the research paper said. \n\"This is useful for conservators who care for this collection [as] we can ensure it reaches future generations,\" Dr Bembibre said.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMan City's Egyptian Prince - Lineker on Marmoush\nThere is not much Erling Haaland has failed to do when it comes to scoring goals since he joined Manchester City.\nFifty-two overall in his first season, including 36 in the Premier League, the most anyone has scored in a single campaign.\nThirty-eight in his second, despite being injured for almost two months, and 27 so far this term.\nThat incredible haul has secured the Norwegian two Golden Boots and an incredible 11 hat-tricks. \nYet none of those trebles came quicker than the 13 minutes and 54 seconds Omar Marmoush took to get his first City hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Newcastle.\nAfter four games without scoring since his \u00a359m winter transfer window move from German side Eintracht Frankfurt, it was an impressive and well-timed surge in form given City go to Real Madrid for their crucial Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday with a one-goal deficit to overcome after a 3-2 loss at home. \nIt was also the first time any City player other than Haaland had scored three times in a game since Phil Foden did it at Brentford just over a year ago.\nAnd that is the point.\nOne of the notable features of the terrible mid-season run of one win in 13 games, which wrecked any chance City had of extending their record run of four successive titles - and was mainly responsible for them ending up having to face Real Madrid so early in the Champions League - was the fact hardly anyone picked up the slack when Haaland's form dipped.\nJosko Gvardiol, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva all scored two goals in that time. But other than Haaland, who got four, no-one scored more.\nMarmoush hits quickfire treble as Man City thrash Newcastle\nOmar Marmoush had scored 20 goals in all competitions for Eintracht Frankfurt this term, when he joined Manchester City\nIt is that issue Guardiola was trying to address when he called contacts in Germany to check up on Marmoush after sporting director Txiki Begiristain had put the Egyptian's name forward as a part of City's overall \u00a3180m January transfer window spend.\n\"When Txiki came to me I said, because of the season we had, the more players you bring the better,\" said Guardiola.\n\"I called some contacts in Germany because I have friends there. I asked a few things and there was a high opinion in many things; behaviour, in training sessions, goals.\n\"He's young and comes here to make his career. That is why the club decides. They always have the last word.\"\nMarmoush had already demanded attention through the 20 goals he scored for Eintracht in the first half of this season.\nAt 26, City were buying someone approaching the prime of their career.\nOn the evidence of his performance against Newcastle, Marmoush drives forward with purpose when the ball is at his feet, is quick and can find space. \nEvidently he presents a danger opposition defences cannot ignore \u2013 and Newcastle could not contain.\nThat, in turn, may take some of the focus away from Haaland.\n\"Everything about his game was impressive,\" former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day. \n\"Already he has a good understanding with Haaland. Newcastle couldn't live with him.\"\n\"We knew with the dynamic he would be good,\" added Guardiola. \"In Germany he made good numbers and he had three chances last week against [Leyton] Orient but didn't score.\n\"He likes to attack the space. It is simple. When you play well, everybody adapts quick. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments because they will come now.\"\nIt was one of those rare occasions when Haaland didn't score and contributed a single assist, for James McAtee, six minutes from time.\nYet his industry was notable, leading from the front in a performance befitting his status as captain for the first time.\nNormally, Guardiola stays out of the captaincy issue, preferring to let the players decide on the leadership group.\nHowever, with club skipper Kyle Walker now at AC Milan, others who have done the job previously, Kevin de Bruyne and Bernardo, on the bench and Ilkay Gundogan overlooked for the role since his return from Barcelona in the summer, Guardiola stepped in to make sure Haaland - who last month signed a new deal that runs to 2034 - took the role.\n\"When Kyle left, Kevin became the first but I nominated Erling, not them,\" said the City boss.\n\"When a player is going to be here 10 years, sooner or later, you need to take the responsibility. He did it for the first time.\"\nGuardiola also played down the injury Haaland appeared to suffer in the final minutes.\nThe Norway international initially sat down and flexed his leg before the physios came on. It was immediately decided to take him off.\nHowever, Haaland watched the remainder of the game from the bench and went back on to the pitch to shake hands with opposition players after the final whistle.\n\"When he went down, everyone was scared,\" added Guardiola.\n\"But he got up and walked away smiling as always.

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools.\n\"But what do you favour, the character of the man or someone who can pass off both hands at 16? There is good out of both.\"\nIf English rugby is short of the former, it could start looking in less familiar settings.\n\"There are thousands out there like me,\" says Genge of the state system's untapped talent.\n\"But until we open our doors to all the kids and give them the absolutely necessary tools and resources, we are going to keep having this conversation.\"",

He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.England international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.A large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.There may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.Since January, VAT has been payable on school fees.The move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.Various figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.As headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.

This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

        "summary": "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US. Trump tariff VAT threat raises fears of hit to UK17 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesConcerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",

        "article_text": "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.\nSea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.\nBut as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.\nThis latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.\nOver the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).\nThis breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.\nArctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.\nThe decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.\nBut until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.\nSince then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.\n\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.\n\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"\nAntarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.\nBut warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.\nThe Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.\n\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"\nAntarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.\nAt the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.\nBut current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.\nThis is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.\nAs well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.\n\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.\nIn recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.\nThis \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.\nThis very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.\nBut, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.\nThe Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.\nDeclining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.\nPolar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.\n\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.\nSea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.\n\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.\nRakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.\n\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.\nWhen Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.\n\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.\nHer teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.\nFor a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.\nA middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.\nThere was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.\nHowever, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.\nHe invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.\nWhen they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"\nCompetition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.\nOver time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.\nThey won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.\nRakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.\nThey missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.\nSimran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.\nBut in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.\nBut the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.\nSimran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.\n\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.\nSimran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.\nTheir first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.\n\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.\nBut by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.\nRiding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.\nBut Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.\nAlthough guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.\n\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.\nBoth Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.\nDespite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.\nRakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"\nThe BBC Indian Sportswoman Of The Year (ISWOTY) Award is back with its fifth edition to celebrate and honour the remarkable achievements of women athletes in India. Find out about the nominees - the winner will be announced on 17 February.",

        "article_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas. \nModi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\nWhile both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\". \nThe Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US. \nAt a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.\n\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".\nTrump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries. \n\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.\nWith India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC. \n\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said. \nHowever, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said. \n\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit. \nTrump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets. \nThe two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".\nModi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US. \nLast week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday. \n Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\nShortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.\nHe acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".\nTrump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.\n\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"\nThe White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.\nThe document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.\n\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said. \n\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"\nTrump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic. \nHe has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. \nEarlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'First time I've played this position' - Merino scores twice on striker debut\nArsenal's failed search for a striker was looming large in manager Mikel Arteta's rear view mirror - until he discovered the answer might have been sitting right behind him at Leicester City.\nThe Gunners looked every inch a team without a recognised main forward as they laboured and spluttered to break down Leicester City's game but limited resistance at King Power Stadium.\nIt was then, after 69 minutes and with Arsenal's title pursuit losing momentum, Arteta put Raheem Sterling out of his misery and turned to Merino, the Spain midfield man signed from Real Sociedad for \u00a332.6m last August.\nArsenal started with Leandro Trossard as a false nine. This did not work and it was Merino's arrival and accomplished finishing with both goals in the 2-0 win, that has given Arteta very palatable food for thought and kept the Gunners firmly in the title hunt.\nWilliam Saliba offered himself up as a potential striker solution after Kai Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring injury on Arsenal's sunshine break to Dubai, but this was not an option given his high-class quality in defence.\nArteta suggested another defender, Riccardo Calafiori, might be in the frame and the Italian has shown an eye for a goal - but Merino has made his case in Arsenal's state of emergency, scoring twice in a game for the first time since 2016.\nIt was a tactical switch that had a touch of desperation as well as improvisation, but Arteta and Merino must take the credit as Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 15 games in the Premier League - 10 wins and five draws. It is their best run since going 16 games unbeaten between December 2010 and April 2011 under Arsene Wenger.\nA delighted Arteta said: \"Mikel has a sense of danger and great timing in the box. We were composed, scored two brilliant goals and could have scored one or two more.\nHe added: \"He has got a goal threat. He can smell danger. He can anticipate the action. He's got really good timing to arrive in certain areas and execute.\n\"We are going to have various contexts and we are prepared. We have to have the pictures in our heads for these scenarios. We have to see where the game is and what is demanded. In this game we believed it was him. The hardest thing then is to deliver and he did.\n\"I think the game started to suit him more because Leicester started to defend much deeper. We had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period. And we believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it.\"\nMerino's late double keeps Arsenal title pursuit on track at Leicester\nSaturday's Premier League action and reaction\nThis video can not be played\nArteta's game changing sub  'You have to try things'\nThe 6ft 2in Merino's height and stature make him an obvious threat and so it proved. He stole in to head home powerfully from Ethan Nwaneri's right-wing cross with nine minutes left, before finishing with confidence after 87 minutes to wrap up the win that leaves Arsenal four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool having played a game more.\nThe player himself played down the notion he might figure more as a striker, but on this evidence Arteta may give him no say in the matter as he makes his plans without Havertz and Gabriel Jesus until next season.\nMerino said when asked about starting as a striker: \"I don't think so to be honest. It is certainly the first time I have scored two coming off the bench as a striker.\"\nHe told BBC Match Of The Day: \"It was big news for me this morning when one of the assistants told me this was an option. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do.\n\"Mikel told me to use my strengths in the box and I was in the right place at the right time. I've not trained there once but I know what everyone has to do on the pitch. Tactically, we are a rich team and I just tried to emulate all the guys who are out injured.\"\nIf Merino, justifiably, grabbed the headlines, it was 17-year-old Nwaneri who was Arsenal's overall inspiration with a superb performance of skill, confidence, pace and maturity.\nNwaneri delivered the inviting cross for Merino's opener, having previously hit the woodwork twice in Arsenal's only serious moments of threat before those late goals.\nArteta was lavish in his praise of Nwaneri, as well as his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, who ensured Arsenal stayed on level terms by applying a vital touch to Jordan Ayew's cross with Bobby de Cordova-Reid waiting to tap in a simple finish at the far post with the scoreline goalless.\nArsenal's nerves and anxiety were mounting until Merino stepped into the breach, the lack of a serious central threat obvious as every attempt floundered near goal with Leicester City holding firm.\nIn among that pre-Merino mediocrity, it was a dismal day for Sterling, who struggled to do a thing right and looked short of confidence and the old pace before Arteta decided he had seen enough.\nSterling looked crestfallen as he walked off, another opportunity missed for the 30-year-old former England forward to show he can still be a going concern at this level as he continues to struggle at Arsenal after being marginalised by Chelsea.\nNo such problems for Merino, who has not had a full effect in midfield since his Arsenal arrival but may now have the chance to do so further forward as Arteta looks to solve his most pressing problem.\nAnd there was a touch of belated romance about Merino's heroics and Arsenal's win as the Spain midfielder said: \"I forgot to give my wife something for Valentine's Day so this goes to her.

        "summary": "'He can smell danger' - is Merino Arsenal's striker solution?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'First time I've played this position' - Merino scores twice on striker debutPhil McNultyChief football writer The King Power StadiumPublished1 hour ago159 CommentsArsenal's failed search for a striker was looming large in manager Mikel Arteta's rear view mirror - until he discovered the answer might have been sitting right behind him at Leicester City.The Gunners looked every inch a team without a recognised main forward as they laboured and spluttered to break down Leicester City's game but limited resistance at King Power Stadium.It was then, after 69 minutes and with Arsenal's title pursuit losing momentum, Arteta put Raheem Sterling out of his misery and turned to Merino, the Spain midfield man signed from Real Sociedad for \u00a332.6m last August.Arsenal started with Leandro Trossard as a false nine. This did not work and it was Merino's arrival and accomplished finishing with both goals in the 2-0 win, that has given Arteta very palatable food for thought and kept the Gunners firmly in the title hunt.William Saliba offered himself up as a potential striker solution after Kai Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring injury on Arsenal's sunshine break to Dubai, but this was not an option given his high-class quality in defence.Arteta suggested another defender, Riccardo Calafiori, might be in the frame and the Italian has shown an eye for a goal - but Merino has made his case in Arsenal's state of emergency, scoring twice in a game for the first time since 2016.It was a tactical switch that had a touch of desperation as well as improvisation, but Arteta and Merino must take the credit as Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 15 games in the Premier League - 10 wins and five draws. \"If Merino, justifiably, grabbed the headlines, it was 17-year-old Nwaneri who was Arsenal's overall inspiration with a superb performance of skill, confidence, pace and maturity.Nwaneri delivered the inviting cross for Merino's opener, having previously hit the woodwork twice in Arsenal's only serious moments of threat before those late goals.Arteta was lavish in his praise of Nwaneri, as well as his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, who ensured Arsenal stayed on level terms by applying a vital touch to Jordan Ayew's cross with Bobby de Cordova-Reid waiting to tap in a simple finish at the far post with the scoreline goalless.Arsenal's nerves and anxiety were mounting until Merino stepped into the breach, the lack of a serious central threat obvious as every attempt floundered near goal with Leicester City holding firm.In among that pre-Merino mediocrity, it was a dismal day for Sterling, who struggled to do a thing right and looked short of confidence and the old pace before Arteta decided he had seen enough.Sterling looked crestfallen as he walked off, another opportunity missed for the 30-year-old former England forward to show he can still be a going concern at this level as he continues to struggle at Arsenal after being marginalised by Chelsea.No such problems for Merino, who has not had a full effect in midfield since his Arsenal arrival but may now have the chance to do so further forward as Arteta looks to solve his most pressing problem.And there was a touch of belated romance about Merino's heroics and Arsenal's win as the Spain midfielder said: \"I forgot to give my wife something for Valentine's Day so this goes to her. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do. And we believed that he could impact the game.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.\nOn Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.\nIn outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.\nWhile big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.\nThe memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days. \nTrump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April. \nTrump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.\n\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".\n\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"\nAs well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports. \nTrump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.\nStill, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"\nIn recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.\nAhead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".\n\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good. \nCountries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nHistorically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium. \nThe US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.\nIn setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US. \nThe White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.\nBut officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax. \nThose kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK. \nDuncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus. \n\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said. \n\nThursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration. \nEarlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.\nHe also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March. \nShares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced. \nJohn Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".\nBut he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy. \n\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.\nHowever, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves. \nHe does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation. \n\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said. \nHe noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.\n\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.\nTrump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.\n\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"\nBut surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households. \nA recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats. \n\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".\nReporting contributed by Tom Espiner",

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nKendrick Lamar's most famous lyric was the heard around the world at last weekend's Super Bowl.\nAn estimated 127 million viewers saw the rapper flash a devious smile to the camera as he delivered the line - a withering takedown of bitter rival Drake.\nTaken from Grammy-winning track Not Like Us, it refers to accusations that the Canadian star had relationships with underage women - something he's denied.\nBut as 70,000 fans inside New Orlean's Caesars Superdome belted it out with him, it felt like Kendrick's winning play in the pair's long-running beef. \nIt's been public, personal and petty, but Kendrick has implied that he's waging a much wider war. \nNot just against Drake, but against what he represents.\n\"Drake is the face of the hip-hop scene as it is,\" says Margs, a London rapper who hosts rap battles on his channel Pen Game. \nThe Canadian is a huge commercial success - the most streamed artist of the 2010s, 143 million Instagram followers and a fixture on party playlists and nightclub set lists.\nHis style is melodic and accessible. He sings. \nIn other words, he's as much a pop star as he is a rapper. And where Drake goes, others follow.\n\"A lot of people see him as being responsible for the watering down of the product,\" says Margs.\n\"There's people that like the commercial side of music that just want to dance and enjoy themselves and it have no substance to it. \n\"And then there's the other side which is deep-rooted in the hip-hop culture.\"\nIt's a culture Kendrick wants to defend and celebrate.\nSpeaking before the Super Bowl show, he said the \"grit\" had gone from the genre. \n\"When people talk about rap, the conversations I'm hearing, they think it's just rapping, it's not an actual art form,\" he said.\nKendrick also took issue with rap being \"minimised to a catchy song or verse\", and said his feud with Drake actually came \"more from a space of more people putting rap to the back\".\n\"You didn't see that grit, you didn't see that bite any more. So I always took that into consideration with my music,\" he said.\nNot everyone agrees that a more mainstream-friendly version of rap makes Drake less credible.\nHis one-time rival Common recently defended him against the \"pop star\" label - saying that \"he's still an MC\" even though his songs are popular.\nKendrick, though, is passionate about rap as an artform, and said the success of Not Like Us and being chosen as the first solo hip-hop artist to front the halftime show \"meant everything\".\n\"To represent it on this type of stage is just everything that I've worked for and everything I believe in for the culture, I live and die by it,\" he said.\nHip-hop, a genre which has been around for 50 years, has a long history of protest.\nMargs says \"a lot of that has been lost\" when comparing current trends with the genre's origins.\n\"They cared about the message and what it stands for because hip-hop was something that was heavily politicised,\" he says.\n\"People used to use their voices in hip-hop to protest and get their messages out.\"\nThe political messaging in Kendrick's halftime show came from the start when actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as US government icon Uncle Sam, introduced the rapper.\nFrom there, it included references to the black power movement, imagery of a divided United States and, just before the finale, the line: \"This is bigger than the music.\"\nIt's a time of political change in the US following the re-election of Donald Trump, who was at the Super Bowl.\n\"There's no better time for people to stand on business and talk about things that matter,\" Margs says. \nKendrick - and his beef with Drake - also hark back to the origins of hip-hop in another way. \nHe's said he sees rap as a sport - and battle raps were his inspiration for the back-and-forth with Drake.\nThese face-offs - as seen in the Eminem film 8Mile - are where artists compete live, swapping disses and trying to spit the best bars to take home the prize.\nIt's rap in its purest form - substance over style and a focus on lyricism.\nKendrick said it's always been that way for him, and it's a vital part of finding the \"grit\" and \"bite\" he feels is missing.\n\"I still watch battle raps, this has always been the core definition of who I am and it's been this way since day one,\" he said.\nMargs thinks Kendrick's success will shine a light on battle rap, but he acknowledges emerging rappers are now finding new ways to cut their teeth. \nAmong them is Layyah, who was the first female rapper to win The Rap Game UK.\nShe's Team Kendrick, but doesn't plan on following his example on battle rap. \nLayyah says rap artists she looks up to like Central Cee are \"definitely not battle rappers\" but have found success and respect through other routes. \n\"We have so many platforms,\" she says. \"It's more like who can make a great song and then who can make the best routine to it.\n\"If that goes viral then it's a great song, you don't really have to do the battle raps.\"\nMargs thinks that's \"taken away from the art form a little bit\".\n\"You can win a battle on social media just through popularity or being funny... whereas with battle rap it's all about your lyrics and your skill.\"\nAs for Kendrick's beef with Drake, it's stayed quiet since Not Like Us was released last summer.\nSome people took the \"Game Over\" at the end of Kendrick's Super Bowl set as the end of the battle, and Drake's just released Gimme a Hug.\nIn that he suggests he wants to put the beef behind him and \"get the party lit\".\nBut there's still an ongoing legal case over Not Like Us - with the potential of a bitter courtroom face-off.\nMargs says that's a big contrast to settling scores on the battle rap stage. \n\"There's a sportsmanship to it but never spills over into more than that,\" says Margs.\n\"After the fight, they always hug it out and show respect for their competitor.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

Now we can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on an issue that threatens it.\n\"Many, many leaders have talked about Europe that needs its own military - an army of Europe.\"\nThe concept of a European army has been proposed by other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron who has long backed the bloc's own military to reduce its reliance on the US.\nThe idea was quickly rebuffed by the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.\nZelensky said: \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin.

        "article_text": "How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nA popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: \"I don't care about Levy, he doesn't care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski.\"\nProminent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: \"Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed\" and \"24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change\".\nA crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.\nThe debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.\nFan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.\nClub sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.\nTottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.\nA 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\nLast week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.\nAmong those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.\nBBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.\nSome of the key points made were:\nLevy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structures\nHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide away\nAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially\nClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals\nSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies.\nA banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy's tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the \"most profitable club in Premier League history\" because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a \"degree of caution\" on transfer spending.\nHe describes Spurs as a \"superb cash-making machine\" who have \"outperformed any other club in England\".\nMaguire outlined:\nHis figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made \u00a3171m profit. Burnley were second on \u00a3159m, with Arsenal third on \u00a3105m\nIn the past decade, Spurs have the sixth-highest total wage bill in the Premier League (\u00a31.6bn vs Man City's \u00a32.9bn as the highest); the sixth-highest transfer spend (\u00a31.3bn vs Chelsea's \u00a32.8bn as the most); with the fifth-highest net spend over a similar period\nTottenham fans pay among the highest season ticket prices and matchday prices in the top flight\nLevy has the highest chief executive pay of Premier League clubs that declare such data. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned \u00a36.6m.\nDaniel Levy has been Tottenham's chairman since 2001\nClub insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham's progress under his leadership.\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be \"very ruthless\" but \"genuinely wants the best for Spurs\".\nThey claimed some of the \"own goals\" - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not \"surround himself with the best people\". \nThey described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as \"people too similar to him\" who will \"sit with their heads in their phones\", rather than \"people who make up for [Levy's] weaknesses\".\nThe source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: \"One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot.\"\nWhile Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".\nAnother source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".\nThey added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.\nFrom the archive: Inside Levy's 20 years at Tottenham (2021)\nPostecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy?\nIs Postecoglou's style causing Tottenham's injury crisis?\nSources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. \nThey say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table.\nWhile Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner.\nThat means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say.\nDuring the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club.\nOther sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League's highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated \u00a350m-plus over his 25 years in charge.\nThis week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs' ownership situation played it down.\nIn 2023, when Paris St-Germain's owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\nOne source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \"more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement\" - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates.\nVarious reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn.\nChelsea were bought in a deal worth up to \u00a34.25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was \u00a32.5bn with a commitment to spending \u00a31.75bn over the next 10 years.\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for \u00a31.03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to \u00a35bn for 100% of the club.\nDespite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential.\nAccording to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new \u00a31.2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was \"all-consumed\" and the board \"left everyone to do their jobs\". \nSpurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.\nThat source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.\nPaul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.\nIt could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".\nAnother source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".\nThey said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.\nHowever, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. \nOne criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.\nLevy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".\nThey are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.\nThe source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.\nThey added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.\nIt was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".\nSources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. \nThey will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation.\nTottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.\nIt is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models.\nSpurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the 'traditional top six' are either richer or bigger.\n\"We don't make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don't apologise at all,\" Levy said at September's fan forum.\n\"We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we've got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we're looking for.\"\nIn a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United's 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. \nThey believe a \"vocal minority\" of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change.\nThey added: \"Spurs haven't got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come.\"\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women.

        "summary": "India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died9 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, London\u2022@geetapandeybbcGetty ImagesIndia is among a few dozen countries that do not recognise marital rapeWarning: This report contains some disturbing detailsAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.The lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". \"Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.The British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.India government says criminalising marital rape 'excessively harsh'In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriageThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. \"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. \"The court documents make for grim reading.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.Getty ImagesA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to criminalise marital rapeThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".",

        "article_text": "Solitary lifestyles can have some big advantages in the animal world. Can humans learn anything from them?\nThe Middle East blind mole rat is the ultimate introvert. Residing about a foot underground, it digs out its own tunnel systems where it stays for most of its life, gathering roots, tubers, and bulbs. Each mole rat has its own territory \u2013 for good reason; if one mole rat accidentally burrows into another one's tunnel, the rodents will bare their teeth or bite each other in violent, often deadly battles.\u00a0\nBlind mole rats generally only interact with others of their species during the mating season, but even then, they must proceed cautiously. The male digs through the soil towards a female but pauses before entering her tunnel. For several days, they send vibrational signals to each other by drumming on the tunnel ceiling with their heads. Only when the female expresses an interest to meet will the male advance, mate with her, and leave. After closing the tunnel behind him, he continues his reclusive way of life.\nSolitary lifestyles such as this are remarkably widespread across the animal kingdom. Even among mammals \u2013 a generally sociable bunch \u2013 22% of studied species are largely solitary, meaning that males and females sleep and forage or hunt alone for most of the time.\nBut solitary animals have received relatively little attention from scientists. Perhaps because we are social creatures ourselves, we've been more drawn to studying creatures that cooperate in groups for protection or to find food, breed and raise young. Experts say that for a long time, many scientists have tended to overlook the solitary life, deeming it a more primitive, basic state of existence, associated with anti-social behaviour and poor intelligence.\u00a0\nBut researchers are now coming to recognise that some animals have evolved to be solitary precisely because it can be so beneficial to avoid the competition and stressful conditions of group living. To boot, many solitary animals are in fact highly intelligent and live diverse and complex social lives, despite their solitude. Though blind mole rats are an exception, many solitary animals do tolerate, learn from and occasionally even cooperate with others of their kind, allowing them to enjoy the best of both worlds.\nAs humans are increasingly spending more time alone, these animals remind us of the many benefits of solitude and that living alone does not equal lonely \u2013 a thought perhaps worth considering for people spending Valentine's Day alone.\n\"Maybe by studying solitary species and how they succeed with this tactic\u2026 we can also better identify for human society what is good about being alone,\" says behavioural ecologist Carsten Schradin of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique in Strasbourg, France, and co-author of a 2024 review about solitary living in mammals.\nLiving in groups certainly has many benefits. Think of zebras that find safety in herds and lions that often hunt together to overcome prey larger and faster than themselves. Some birds collaborate to raise young and chimps that socialise by picking parasites off each other. But it also has downsides. In a group, \"every shelter has to be shared, every bit of food has to be shared, every access to a mate has to be shared\", says David Scheel, a behavioural ecologist at Alaska Pacific University. \"Or if it's not shareable, only one of you can get it.\"\nAnd while hunting together and sharing food makes sense for animals like lions that are often surrounded by abundant, large prey that can feed multiple individuals, this is less beneficial in situations where prey is smaller and less shareable. Nor is it as helpful when prey is scattered throughout the landscape where it takes more effort to find them.\nThis is probably why armadillos and anteaters forage alone for few-and-far-between insects, and why tigers \u2013 which roam far and wide to find relatively scarce prey \u2013 hunt by themselves, helping them to sneak up on their prey more easily. To further reduce competition, tigers and some other solitary hunters form small territories that they defend from other predators.\nFor blind mole rats, solitude means not needing to constantly compete for tunnel space, which takes a lot of energy to dig. Solitary animals may also face less competition for mates and a reduced risk of contracting diseases and parasites. Meanwhile, young-raising females can invest all their energy into caring for their own offspring without having to tend to their neighbours' young, like some more social species do. For other creatures, like sloths, their camouflage may only work if they're not in large groups.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If you're solitary-living, you're less conspicuous,\" says Lindelani Mayuka, a zoologist from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa and co-author of the review with Schradin.\u00a0\nLiving alone does create other challenges \u2013 such as missing out on the benefit of huddling together to stay warm. But some animals like the bush Karoo rat of southern Africa get around this by building big stick lodges to protect themselves from temperature swings as well as predators, Mayuka says.\nFor highly social animals, being alone can be stressful \u2013 often leading to poor health and anxiety \u2013 but solitary animals do just fine. In fact, Middle East blind mole rats become stressed and anxious when they're placed next to one another, even if there's a barrier between them, with smaller, more submissive individuals suffering the most.\u00a0\n\"They can die from the stress that they have,\" says Tali Kimchi, a behavioural neuroscientist at the Weizmann Institute in Israel who studies the blind mole rats in her laboratory. Like all mammals, blind mole rat mothers tend to their offspring, but mums eventually become hostile, forcing their young to dig away from her tunnel. \"It sounds funny, but that's the survival of these creatures,\" she says.\nNot all solitary species actively repel each other. Many of them are drawn together by shared resources and have surprisingly rich social lives, tolerating each other and even cooperating when it makes sense. For example, bush Karoo rats that live close to related individuals have frequent, amicable interactions with one another \u2013 sharing foraging grounds with related females and sometimes even stick lodges at the end of the breeding season when there\u2019s a great demand for stock lodges.\n\"Just because some animals are solitary living does not mean that they do not have social interactions,\" Mayuka says.\nEven some octopuses \u2013 a group once considered so solitary it was a running joke that they'd only meet to mate or eat each other \u2013 sometimes aggregate, Scheel says. At one site in Jervis Bay in eastern Australia, individuals of a species called the gloomy octopus are drawn together by the availability of shelter. This probably started when one octopus piled up discarded shells after eating and these eventually stabilised enough of the sediment that another octopus could build its burrow inside. This new resident then created its own pile of discarded shells \u2013 until as many as 16 octopuses gathered on one spot, says Scheel, who has been studying the site with his colleagues.\nIn this \"octopus city\", individuals find themselves in a much more crowded situation than they are used to and exhibit curious behaviours to cope with others of their kind.\nMales sometimes try to coerce females into staying nearby and chase other males \u2013 occasionally crawling into each other's dens, wrestling with and evicting them. Sometimes when evicted males come back to their den, \"the evicting male may return and repeat the eviction\", Scheel says. And as they clean out their dens, the octopuses often push debris onto their neighbours' side. Sometimes, they hold the debris and use their funnels to blast it at one another, says Scheel, who documented some of these interactions in a 2022 paper.\nNeither aggressive nor cooperative, some scientists call these behaviours \"jostling\", says Scheel, who is still working out the purpose of these interactions. \"Here we've plopped a solitary animal into a complex social situation, and all they're doing is jostling, and they seem totally healthy. That suggests they're either less solitary than we thought, or the stresses of being [social] are not that severe [for them].\"\nThese sophisticated social interactions underscore the intelligence of solitary creatures. Similarly, researchers have seen some solitary reptiles closely watching other individuals and using that information to solve problems \u2013 an ability once thought to be unique to humans, says behavioural scientist Anna Wilkinson of the University of Lincoln in the UK. \"Animals who maybe wouldn't naturally form complex groups can actually have really quite sophisticated aspects of social learning,\" she says.\nIn experiments with red-footed tortoises, which forage by themselves but might encounter one another under fruiting trees, for example, Wilkinson presented them with a V-shaped, transparent fence with food on the inside. No animal could reach the food until Wilkinson and her colleagues trained one of them how to do it. Upon seeing their fellow reptile reach the food, the other tortoises immediately followed suit. It's especially remarkable to see that reptiles have the ability to learn from other individuals by imitation, considering that many of them have evolved to\u00a0hatch\u00a0from eggs without a parent around to teach them skills.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The linguist learning to speak 'cow'\n\u2022 The eerie ambassador from the abyss\n\u2022 Why some animals appear to mourn their dead\nEvidence like this is causing scientists to see solitary living not as a fixed, uniform category, but rather as a continuum: from animals like the (arguably) antisocial blind mole rat to species that live largely alone but learn from and cooperate with one another. Some species even blend solitary and more social lifestyles, like communally living striped mice that go solo once they start breeding, or raccoon-like coatis, whose males are solitary and females hunt in bands.\nStudying solitary animals and their social networks can help conservationists better protect and preserve their populations from human threats. Mayuka and Schradin have already started an effort to build a community of scientists to further decipher the lives, benefits, needs and challenges of solitary animals. \"Being solitary is not simple and primitive,\" Schradin says. \"It can be quite complex and provide challenges\u2026 which are solved in different ways by different species.\"\nUnderstanding the full breadth of solitary living could even be helpful for people. Kimchi is studying changes in the brains of blind mole rats as they switch between introverted and more social mating and pup-raising stages. Perhaps such research can help scientists understand how people with neurological or psychiatric conditions become socially withdrawn, she says.\u00a0\nBut solitary animals can also help us consider that being alone doesn't necessarily have to be problematic, even if it has been somewhat stigmatised in our extrovert-driven society, says Schradin. \"Social\" solitary animals construct meaningful social networks around them \u2013 and people living by themselves can, and do, too. \"Being alone,\" Schradin says, \"can also be the best choice for many humans.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\n\u00a0For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

Somebody has worked hard to get it good,\" she said.\n\"I think if they just add a little more honesty when they are visiting these places, I think that is definitely needed.\"\nAshley French, an owner of the restaurants French Village and Orto in Belfast, said that influencers are a \"mixed bag\".\n\"It depends who it is really; there are ones who are genuine\u2026 then you have others who are potentially just wanting an invite to the opening of an envelope,\" he said.\nMr French said that while his restaurants will often be visited by influencers, he doesn't invite them or offer them payment or a discounted meal.\n\"Our feeling is that we would rather look after the paying public\".\nHe said that people are more likely to decide to eat at his restaurants based on word of mouth than social media.\nJohnny Mooney and Ben Kane, the content creators behind @foodandcraic, told BBC News NI that they \"definitely\" don't consider themselves food critics.\nMr Kane said they make videos purely \"to talk highly about places that we enjoy\".\n\"If we don't enjoy the experience, we don't post it,\" Mr Mooney added. \n\"Our content allows you to visually see what you're getting... so the opinion you'll form from our content will probably be more well-rounded than from written [content],\" he said.\nMs Jackson said branded is \"very important\" to help influencers \"stay afloat\".\nBut she added that she won't recommend something that she didn't enjoy in paid-for reviews.\nEd Senior, a compliance executive at the Advertising Standards Agency, told BBC News NI that the \"whole point\" of influencer marketing is that people can \"produce advertising in a style that they know their followers connect with because it's the same as their editorial content\".\n\"For us that's why it's exceptionally important that actually when it is advertising that it's absolutely clear that it's disclosed as such,\" he added.\nHe said that if a brand asks a creator to make content and pays them either with money or with a free or discounted meal, then it should be classified as advertising. \nHe said that once something is disclosed as advertising, it also needs to meet certain regulations, including whether it is \"accurate and fair\".\nAlongside work educating creators, Mr Senior said that \"targeted enforcement action, when necessary against those [creators] who are established, helps to bring about compliance from the sector as a whole\".",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's future is the focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), just days after a shock phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the Ukraine war.\nDescribing the call earlier this week as \"great\", Trump said there was a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war\". \nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country must not be left out of any peace talks.\nEuropean allies seemed surprised at the nature of the call, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning that any peace agreement which involved capitulating to Russia would end \"badly for everyone\".\nIt is still unclear when peace negotiations could begin, but when they do issues around territory, security negotiations and Ukraine's future in Nato will be among the key topics for discussion. Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "Despite the hype, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Washington under Donald Trump's second term was a sober, business-first affair - unsurprising for a working visit, which lacks the pomp of a state visit.\nTrump announced expanded US military sales to India from 2025, including F-35 jets, along with increased oil and gas exports to narrow the trade deficit. Both sides agreed to negotiate a trade deal and finalise a new defence framework. \nHe also confirmed the US had approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman accused of playing a role in the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai.\n\"That's a lot of deliverables for an administration less than a month old,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington told the BBC\n\"Overall, both sides seem comfortable continuing Biden-era collaborations, particularly in tech and defence, though many will be rebranded under Trump.\"\nStill, major challenges lie ahead. Here are the key takeaways:\nModi's visit came as Trump ordered that US trading partners should face reciprocal tariffs - tit-for-tat import taxes to match similar duties already charged by those countries on American exports. He ordered advisers to draft broad new tariffs on US trade partners, warning they could take effect by 1 April.\nIndia enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. India cut average tariffs from 13% to 11% in its federal budget in a bid to pre-empt Trump's tariff moves. \nThe jury is out on whether India appears to have dodged tariff shocks for now.\nAjay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI), says he doesn't see any \"problems with tariffs\".\nThe main reason, he says, is that 75% of the US exports to India attract import taxes of less than 5%.\n\"Trump points to extreme outlier tariffs like 150% on select items, but that's not the norm. India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.\nAbhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced.\n\"The devil lies in the details. Reciprocal tariffs won't just mirror India's import taxes -other factors will come into play,\" he told the BBC.\nTrump's approach could go beyond import duties, factoring in value added tax (VAT), non-tariff barriers and trade restrictions. While India's goods and services tax (GST) on imported goods aligns with WTO rules, Trump may still use it to justify higher tariffs.\nA US government memo on reciprocal tariffs hints at this strategy, citing costs to American businesses from non-tariff barriers, subsidies and burdensome regulations abroad. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.\nMr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected under WTO rules. \n\"This will hamper India's ability to prioritise domestic producers, posing a direct challenge to the 'Make in India' initiative. This is certainly not good news for us.\" \nMr Das suggests that India should counter Trump's reciprocal tariff logic, particularly in agriculture where the US imposes strict non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian exports such as stiff maximum residue limits on chemicals. \nHe argues that since the US \"heavily subsidises\" its farm sector, India should highlight these subsidies to push back against American claims.\nTariffs alone may not help bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. Defence and energy purchases will go some way in addressing the deficit, experts say.\nThe new $500bn (\u00a3400bn) trade goal aims to more than double the $190bn trade between the two countries in 2023.\nModi and Trump committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. Talks will focus on market access, tariff reductions and supply chain integration across goods and services.\n\"The announcement that the two sides will pursue a trade deal gives India an opportunity to negotiate for reduced tariffs on both sides. That would be a boon not only for the US-India relationship, but also for an Indian economy that's sputtered in recent months,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nWhat is not clear is what kind of trade deal the both sides will be aiming at.\n\"What is this trade agreement? Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?\" wonders Mr Srivastava. \nMr Das believes we'll have to wait for details on the trade agreement. \n\"It doesn't necessarily mean a free trade deal - if that were the case, it would have been stated explicitly. It could simply involve tariff reductions on select products of mutual interest.\"\nPriyanka Kishore, principal economist at the Singapore-based consultancy firm, Asia Decoded, says $500bn is a \"tall target but there are low hanging fruit we can immediately exploit\".\n\"For instance the US sanctions on Russian shadow fleet are soon going to kick in, so India can easily pivot to the US for more oil. This will not be too difficult.\"\nTrump said at the joint press conference that the US would hopefully become India's number one supplier of oil and gas. \nIndia's defence trade with the US has surged from near zero to $20 billion, making the US its third-largest arms supplier. \nWhile Russia remains India's top source, its share has dropped from 62% to 34% (2017-2023) as India shifts toward US procurement.\nIn a major announcement to deepen defence ties, Trump said the US would increase military equipment sales to India \"by many billions of dollars starting this year\" ultimately paving the way to providing the F-35 stealth warplanes.\nBut this will be easier said than done, say experts.\n\"This sounds good, but it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nDespite rising US arms sales to India, bureaucratic hurdles and export controls limit the transfer of sensitive technologies, he says. The new defence framework announced at the summit may help address these challenges.\nAlso India isn't \"taking the F-35 offer seriously\" due to high maintenance demands, says strategic affairs expert Ajai Shukla. \nShukla notes that US arms deals come with challenges - private firms prioritise profit over long-term partnerships. \nYet with delays and cost overruns affecting some of India's arms deals with Russia, Delhi's defence ties with the US look set to deepen.\nModi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss AI and emerging tech, India's foreign ministry said.\nIt's unclear if they addressed Musk's stalled plans for Starlink's India launch or Tesla's market entry. \nMusk has pushed for direct spectrum allocation, clashing with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who favours auctions. His licence remains under review.\nIndia is also courting Tesla to set up a car factory, cutting EV import taxes for automakers committing $500m and local production within three years. Tesla has yet to confirm its plans.\nIn a rare move, Modi joined Trump at a press conference, answering two questions - on illegal immigration and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) bribery charges against the Adani Group.\nIndian billionaire Gautam Adani, accused of close ties with Modi, was charged with fraud in the US last November over an alleged $250m bribery scheme. \nModi said he hadn't discussed the issue with Trump. On immigration, he stated India was ready to take back verified illegal Indian migrants.\nThis was only Modi's third direct press Q&A in his almost 11-year tenure as India's prime minister. He has never held a solo press conference. In 2019 he sat beside then party president Amit Shah as Shah answered all the questions and in 2023, he took just two questions alongside former President Joe Biden.",

        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nIt had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".\nVance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".\nThe Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.\nBut Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.\nHe alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.\n\n\nMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".\nVance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.\nHe raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.\nThe safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.\nBut Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.\nVance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.\nIn response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".\nNine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIn the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties.\n\"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. \"There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, later shared parts of his speech on X, praising it as \"excellent\".

        "summary": "German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".Vance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".The Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.But Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.He alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.Analysis: Vance's blast on Europe ignores Ukraine and defence agendaA quick guide to JD VanceUkraine end game: What each side wants from a peace dealMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".Vance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.He raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.The safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.But Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.Vance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.In response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".Nine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.In the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties. JD Vance attacks Europe over free speech and migration50 minutes agoEmily AtkinsonBBC NewsWatch key moments from Vance's speech in MunichUS Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".It had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. The two reportedly met afterwards, according to German public broadcaster ZDF.In his own speech, Pistorius directly addressed Vance, saying: \"Democracy was called into question by the US vice-president for the whole of Europe. \"All RO [Romanian] authorities are committed to organising free and fair elections by empowering citizens and guaranteeing the freedom to vote,\" he wrote on X.Vance later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the conference, which has otherwise mainly focussed on Russia's full-scale invasion.Zelensky said during the meeting that more work was needed on planning to end the fighting, while Vance said the pair shared a \"fruitful\" conversation.Trump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich, but Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the summit.Leaders set for key security meeting as 'old' world order at risk of crumblingMore work needed to stop Putin, Zelensky says at summit meeting with VanceTrump wants peace.",

        "article_text": "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena. \nKay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".\nOne heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".\nAnother had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.\nThe woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".\nBBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".\nThe incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.\nWith this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.\nLarry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".\n\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.\n\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"\nLast year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".\nWhen discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.\n\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply. \n\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"\nDean recalls his shocked response. \n\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" Dean tells the BBC.\nThe Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.\n\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!\n\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"\nHis second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.\nArenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.\n\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.\nHe says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.\n\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"\nAnother British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".\nDean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.\nBut, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.\nAbi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.\nCrucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.\n\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.\n\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\" \nNew comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as an MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.\nFor Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.\n\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.\n\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!\n\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"\nClarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.\n\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"\nThe other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.\n\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"\nShe's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.\n\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"\nHer new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.\nDuring these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".\nWelsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.\nIt's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant. \nHe sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.\n\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.\n\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"\nStag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.\nHilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.\n\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"\n\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.\n\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"\nHe will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certian \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.\nBut it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".\n\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"\nNine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".\nAnd the one that does, \"might have had a bad day, drank too much or they might just be an [idiot]!\n\"I think it's something within people, we like a bit of drama.\"",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. \n\"I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences.\"",

So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.\n\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.\n\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"\nAnother key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.\nAfter a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role. Anita Dobson took on the character at the last minute.\nActor and stuntman Derek Martin, who joined the soap 15 years later as Charlie Slater, explains he was also up for the role of Den.\n\"Leslie got it, and he was very good, he was the ladies' man, and I was more the hard man,\" the 91-year-old actor says.\nThis pairing of Angie and Den proved popular with the public - and the Christmas Day 1986 episode that sees Den serve Angie divorce papers remains the only scripted programme to have been watched by more than 30 million people in the UK, according to Barb figures.\nThe first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, with 17 million people watching - making it the second most-watched episode on the BBC that week behind The Two Ronnies. \nThis compared with the 18 million who watched the same week's Coronation Street.\nThe episode started with a kick, as Den broke down a door to find the nearly dead body of Reg Cox (played by Johnnie Clayton) - and ended with a punch, as suspect number one in the attack, Nick Cotton (John Altman), put his fist through the glass of the Queen Vic doors.\nThough the press was quick to set up a rivalry between EastEnders and Coronation Street, the cast had their eye on another ITV soap.\nActor Adam Woodyat, who played Ian Beale in that first episode, says: \"We were going out at the same time as Emmerdale Farm at 7pm. It felt like Emmerdale Farm gave us an absolute kicking in the ratings until they shifted us to half past seven.\"\nNewspapers of the time suggested reactions were mixed. A Sunday People poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents didn't like the first episode, with complaints over \"coarse\" and \"bawdy\" dialogue.\nThe Guardian, however, was more measured, with their critic Hugh Hebert predicting it would \"probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right\".\nThe show would prove itself earlier than that. On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week. This coincided with the show's first blockbuster storyline that saw Michelle (played by Susan Tully) become pregnant by a mystery man, eventually revealed to be Den Watts.\n\"After the reveal of Den and Michelle,\" says Woodyat, \"that's when we started to realise we might have something here.\"",

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools.\n\"But what do you favour, the character of the man or someone who can pass off both hands at 16? There is good out of both.\"\nIf English rugby is short of the former, it could start looking in less familiar settings.\n\"There are thousands out there like me,\" says Genge of the state system's untapped talent.\n\"But until we open our doors to all the kids and give them the absolutely necessary tools and resources, we are going to keep having this conversation.\"",

He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.England international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.A large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.There may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.Since January, VAT has been payable on school fees.The move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.Various figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.As headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.He had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.Instead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.Image source, George PaulImage caption, Paul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school playersHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.

        "article_text": "With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.\nAll the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.\nThe bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.\nGoing back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.\nIt was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.\n\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.\nBut for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.\n\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.\nAnother farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.\n\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.\nAlso known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThey are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.\nStanding at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.\nBut with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.\n\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.\nIn the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.\nThis decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.\n\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.\nAround Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. \nConservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.\nDozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.\n\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.\nMr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.\nFarmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.\n\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.\n\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.\nSarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.\nCranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.\n\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.\nTheir exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.\nBut crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.\n\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.\nThey attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.\nScientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.\nAny destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.\nTheir monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.\n\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.\nThis is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.\nAnd in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.\nPresident Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.\nThe ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.\nNature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".\nFor Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.\n\"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,\" he said.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

I didn't know what was going on.\"\nThe 27-year-old says the majority of responses to her message were positive.\n\"When the post went up, and I was an inspiration for everyone, this was a big thing for me.\"\nHafez, who is a clinical pathologist, says she had been given clearance from doctors to fence at the Games and wanted to show the world what a woman's body can do.\n\"This was a really important message for me - an Egyptian Arab woman - to tell all women that your body can surprise you,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes you need to see an example in front of you to know that you can do it. \n\"Because maybe a pregnant woman, she's afraid to do anything, and now she tells herself: 'There's a woman who competes at the Olympics while pregnant. So I can do whatever'.\"\nHafez upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky of the United States, in her first match at Paris 2024\nBut not everyone was so supportive of Hafez revealing that she fenced in the women's individual sabre at the Grand Palais while carrying a baby.\nA day later Hafez put out another Instagram post to emphasise she was not the first pregnant woman to appear at an Olympics and that she had wanted to \"shed light on the strength, perseverance and relentlessness\" of Egyptian women.\nThat strength came to the fore when dealing with negativity online.\n\"Some people don't want to see you succeed,\" she reflected.\n\"It's easy to put a comment and run. You don't face me.\n\"I wanted to clarify that I'm a doctor and this (competing while pregnant) is something that is not against any medical issues.\n\"Some people were saying I should have given the place to someone else. But this was not an option because I qualified.\n\"My mum told me 'Don't be sad if you read anything' - but I'm proud of what I did. I achieved something and it was very challenging.\"\nWith fencing being a combat sport using swords, could that have provoked the negative comments?\n\"For me, fencing is not as it looks - it has this sense of touch. My doctor assured me that it's not unsafe.\"\nHafez took up fencing aged 12 and has appeared at the past three editions of the Olympic Games\nCairo-based Hafez, who pursued her passion for fencing while studying for her medical degree, became an Egyptian sabre champion and went to both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games. \nSo, having qualified for Paris 2024, did she consider pulling out when she discovered she was pregnant? \n\"Yes, of course. I knew I was pregnant a week before a World Cup [event], and I said, 'Okay, I won't chance it because it's my first pregnancy',\" she explained.\n\"I didn't know how I would feel. \n\"I was waiting for my husband [a cardiothoracic surgeon] to tell me to stop and take rest. But he told me: 'We'll go to the doctor. Whatever he says, we'll do.'\n\"And the doctor said: 'You don't have a disease. You're just pregnant. If you're okay and everything is normal, you can do whatever you want.'\"\nWith that reassurance, Hafez felt ready to resume training. \nMindful of the spotlight falling on her nation if the news came out, she kept it as quiet as she could.\n\"I didn't have to tell anyone, because it's not against Olympic regulations,\" she said.\n\"I just told the people who needed to know. The most important thing was not to go against any laws or health conditions.\n\"I didn't know if I would make it so I took it step by step until I reached the Olympics.\"\nEgypt's National Olympic Committee told BBC Sport Africa it has no rules barring pregnant women from training or competing.\n\"But it has to be a safe environment and we have to make sure there is no risk involved,\" an official said.\nNada Hafez was full of emotion after she made it through to the last 16 of the Paris Games, her third Olympics having also competed at at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020\nNow a mum to four-month-old baby Zaina, Hafez can reflect on the part her daughter played in her achievements in Paris.\n\"I worked with my mental coach. I wanted to do something different for my baby,\" she said.\n\"I tried not to think that I have my excuse not to win. I thought differently: 'I'm pregnant and I will win', and I did it.\"\nHafez went on to upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky, 15-13.\n\"It's one of the best results for female Egyptian Olympians,\" Hafez added.\n\"I was crying with happiness. This is something for my baby to be proud of.\"\nShe then lost 15-7 to Jeon Hayoung of South Korea in the last 16.\nNeither of her opponents knew Hafez was expecting. \n\"It's unfair if someone knows. Maybe they'd be afraid to put a touch or something, so no need to tell them.\"\nHafez, who is studying for a masters degree alongside being a new mum, is aiming to use her platform to stand up for women's rights in sport.\nShe has not yet decided whether she wants to try and qualify for Los Angeles 2028.\nFor now, she is still processing what she achieved in Paris.\n\"Young girls told me, 'You've inspired us so much. We want to go to medical school and continue in sports',\" she said.\n\"And that made me happiest.\n\"Whenever I get a message from anyone telling me I'm a role model it sets my heart on fire - because that's what I'm working on for my whole life.\n\"I'm still young. I'm aiming to do more and be a good example as a mum.\n\"I hope my daughter will be an Olympian one day. She's a baby Olympian - and maybe she'll be an adult Olympian.\"",

He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 league matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine.

But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

To do something, we need to sell players.\n\"Our focus now is to win these games. Then we have time to focus on that.\"\nAlthough Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof are out of contract at the end of the season and Jadon Sancho due to complete a permanent move to Chelsea, there are question marks over the futures of United's highest earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford, who has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nAmorim's words will also spark fears homegrown pair Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho might be off-loaded in order for the club to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules which, it has been confirmed, will remain in force next season.\nIn addition to a history of poor recruitment, it appears United have failed to get the most out of the players at Old Trafford.\nScotland midfielder Scott McTominay never appeared to be a regular starter but has excelled since his \u00a325.7m move to Italian side Napoli last August.\nThe 28-year-old has scored six goals in 21 Serie A appearances - and three in his last six as his side have charged to the top of the table.\nEven more startling, Brazilian winger Antony has scored twice in three games since he completed a loan move to Real Betis, having scored just four times in 52 appearances for United since the start of last season.\n\"This is a club with a lot of pressure,\" added Amorim. \"You have to have a base and in this moment we don't have it.\n\"But football is like that.

They keep goats - primarily to make cheese and occasionally for meat - as well as chickens, grow their own vegetables and manage the site's woodland.\nThe building runs off hydropower and a tiny wind turbine and is heated by a log burner. \nThey host weekly Welsh language classes, run workshops, open days and volunteer weeks to demonstrate their way of life.\nMany in the community have jobs away from the farm, they eat communally five times a week and, before the community's families left ahead of the eviction notice, the children were home-schooled.\nWill and the other members each pay rent as well as their contribution to \"food club\", bills, and a savings pot for expenses such as building repairs. \nWith no-one in charge, decisions are made collaboratively and their shared values include inclusivity, gratitude and valuing learning and culture. \nDoes living in this way come with the occasional conflict?\n\"There absolutely are difficulties at times,\" admitted Will.\n\"Occasionally conflicts happen... but there are far fewer than there are beautiful times.\"\nHe said the community tried to take blame out of conflict.\n\"A conflict for me is when we find a glitch in the way in which we're working, no-one's at fault,\" he said.\nHe said \"detangling\" conflicts when there was no-one in charge was \"very deep and intense work and often very painful, but by the end of it we find ourselves stronger, more beautiful, able to act with each other in a more beautiful way\".\nRosie Gilam, who grew up in nearby Cardigan, is Will's partner and spends about three days a week with him at Brithdir Mawr.\nShe has been visiting the community since she was a child and previously lived in communities in Cornwall. \n\"A major wonderful thing about being human is to accept others for what they are, understand they've got their own needs which might not intersect completely with your needs, and to come to a place where you're accepting of your differences and find a way to work together,\" she said.\n\"I think that is so needed on the planet at the moment.\" \nLike Will, she insisted \"nobody's to blame\" for the community's current predicament. \nShe said the situation was an example of \"broken systems\" which meant \"tenants don't have rights, a family can be turfed out of its home with little notice, and that people generally don't have affordable access to land\". \nShe hopes media attention on Brithdir Mawr will start a conversation about land rights and be \"one step towards systemic change\". \n\"So for example, there might be community right to buy, which means that a community like this in the future would have the right to buy an asset,\" she said.  \nAndromeda Gervasio, who is from Portugal, moved to the UK 12 years ago, and moved to Brithdir Mawr last summer after feeling burnt out with city life, \"craving a different lifestyle\" and being drawn to \"intentional community\".\n\"The water is the purest water I've ever drank, and the food is the best food I've ever eaten,\" they said.\n\"People are here not just because, there's a bigger purpose of really living together and sharing the work that it is to live and to live in a place like this... it's pretty incredible.\"\nThey said they cherished being accepted in the countryside. \n\"Being a queer person in the rural landscape has always been something that I was generally scared about... and then actually discovering it and feeling incredibly safe here, I've been so grateful... and I think that I owe lots to Brithdir in that regard,\" they said.\nLike the rest of their community, Andromeda insisted they did not feel animosity towards the new owner. \n\"We're not up against a particular person but a system and a normalised way of going about things,\" they said.\n\"Just because someone has the legal backing to do something, it doesn't necessarily make it okay or how the world should be.\n\"We have a history of things that were within legal bounds not corresponding to what is morally OK to do... [denying] women's rights, slavery and queer witch hunts were all legal at some point.\"\nFor now, what will happen next for the community is uncertain.  \n\"Essentially I feel really, really sad about it,\" said Rosie. \nShe lives in hope of all parties sitting down together and looking for a solution \"with an open heart\". \nWill is confident a resolution can be found.\n\"I don't know exactly what that would look like and that's OK,\" he said. \n\"This complexity and this difficulty feels very difficult, feels gnarly and unpleasant, but also I truly believe that something very special is happening.\n\"I look forward to this process continuing and resolving in a way that works for everyone in the near future.\"",

It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",
