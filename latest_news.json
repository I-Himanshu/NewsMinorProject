        "article_text": "Scientists and industry are finding unusual new uses for brewers' spent grain \u2013 the beer industry's largest waste product.\nPonder the idea of a beer well-brewed and enthusiastic drinkers at least are likely to imagine a pint glass filled to the brim with golden nectar.\u00a0\nWhat they probably won't picture is the mountains of wet sticky shavings that pile up as the largest waste material of brewing beer.\nThis is what's known as brewers' spent grain, and there is an awful lot of it. Around 200g (7oz) is produced for every litre of beer brewed. Globally some 37 million tonnes is produced each year \u2013 equivalent to the weight of around 340 double-decker buses per hour. And as we drink more beer \u2013 sales are expected to rise by a third in the next seven years \u2013 only more and more will be churned out.\nMost brewers' spent grain, around 70% of it, is currently repurposed as cattle feed, while 10% is used to make biogas. Around a fifth is simply sent straight to landfill \u2013 at an additional cost to breweries \u2013 where it rots and releases methane into the atmosphere.\nBut inside this beer by-product there are a mountain of useful chemicals to tap, including lots of protein. Researchers and companies are now beginning to explore how these could be put to better use.\u00a0\nSwiss start-up Upgrain is one of these. In 2024, it launched a processing system to turn brewers' spent grain into protein and fibre, passed as fit for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and the European Food Safety Authority (brewers' spent grain is, after all, still just grain). The system comes ready for installation on brewery premises: shipping container-sized for micro-breweries and a much larger unit for the likes of Brauerei Locher, Switzerland's second biggest brewer, which opened in September 2024 and is now building Europe's largest onsite facility.\nWilliam Beiskjaer, Upgrain's co-founder, argues brewers spent grain is a \"kind of hidden treasure in terms of sustainable and healthy nutrition\". He says it could help to tackle rising global demand for protein. \"There's more and more demand for our foods to be enhanced, especially to get more protein and fibre in our diets,\" he says.\nUpgrain and other producers such as Agrain in Denmark and BiaSol in Ireland are already selling brewers' spent grain protein and fibre extract to food manufacturers for inclusion in baked goods, pizzas, granola and even crisps. It's also being used in plant-based meat alternatives, such as those launched last year by the Swiss supermarket chain Migros, and in a coffee created by Singapore-based company Prefer.\nHype Metre\nBrewers' spent grain is a rich source of nutrients which is arguably wasted as cattle feed and produces methane when it ends up in landfill. A host of start-ups are now using it to make everything from vegan barley milk and leather to baked goods, crisps and even coffee; it even has potential to be used in areas like construction, cosmetics and paper.\nNot all these products are yet past the early stages of development, and products could struggle to see widespread consumer acceptance. Brewers' spent grain also uses lots of energy to process and spoils fast. Scientists and developers are already working to overcome these issues, however.\nHuge brewers such as the Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev and Chicago-based Molson Coors have even created their own vegan barley milk spin-offs made from spent grain. Molson Coors claims its Golden Wing product has a \"rich and creamy taste\" and 25% less sugar than most oat milks.\u00a0\n\"This is an exciting new idea,\" says Beiskjaer. \"If you'd have said to me four years ago that brewers' spent grain would be a [human] food source, I'd have asked what you were talking about. But we're on the way to seeing upcycled BSG as a staple in the food industry.\"\nBeiskjaer says he can see why some people may be squeamish about the notion of \"upcycled food\". \"But we have to get across the idea that brewers' spent grain is not a\u00a0waste\u00a0product,\" he says. \"It's being saved from being a waste product.\"\nMaking use of this waste product to make plant-based protein could in theory also free up the small amounts of arable farmland used to grow wheat, soy and pea for human protein \u2013 or, if it replaced meat, a far larger amount of land. \u00c4io, a biotech start-up based in Tallin, Estonia is using brewers' spent grain and other food and agricultural waste products to develop an alternative to palm oil, a major driver of deforestation in Indonesia and other countries. To do this \u00c4io grows fatty acid-making microorganisms and applies these to a fermentation process not dissimilar to that used in brewing beer.\nThere are some caveats to using brewers' spent grain in food, however. Since it is loaded with moisture and so spoils quickly, using it close to where it is produced is essential. This is one reason why a good proportion ends up in landfill: there's not enough demand from local farmers to meet supply. That dampness risks mould and microbial infection. In fact, says Beiskjaer, \"it becomes the perfect environment for bacteria unless it's quickly preserved\". Techniques for making preservation easier are now being explored.\nBut nutrition isn't the only area where spent grain could make an impact.\nBrett Cotten concedes that early efforts by his young London-based company, Arda Biomaterials, to create leather-alternatives from brewers' spent grain resulted in something more akin to a flapjack.\u00a0\nBut the start-up has since successfully used supramolecular chemistry to make several proteins from brewers' spent grain that mimic the animal proteins in leather, resulting in a strong and supple alternative. The colour reflects the spent grain used, he says. \"Guinness and stouts make for a naturally black material, IPAs and lagers more mid-browns.\"\u00a0\nCotten argues that to date many leather alternatives have either not been as environmentally sound as promised or are not scalable enough to replace animal leather. In contrast, he says, Arda's first test material was made in a home lab using standard kitchen equipment, using the abundant feedstock that is brewers' spent grain.\nSo far staff at the company and a local brewery have wear-trialled this new material with bags and cardholders. Current production is at lab scale, but a pilot facility set to open in London in 2025 will allow it to produce up to 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) a year, the company says.\nArda's own estimates suggest that, were a facility tied to a single major brewing plant \u2013 the likes of one run by Heineken or InBev \u2013 all of the spent grain being produced by the plant could make for 5-10 million sq m (54,000-108 sq ft) of its mid-range faux-leather, suitable for use in fashion and the automotive upholstery industries. Tied to, say, three major brewing facilities, it could undercut the cost of both real and plastics-based synthetic leathers, it argues. Cotten estimates that just 10% of global brewers' spent grain output would satisfy the global demand for leather.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Of course, the look and feel [of our material] is important, but so is scalability,\" says Cotten. \"The fashion industry just wants a new option [to animal or current bioleathers]. And while it's often happy to work with a batch of proof-of-concept material for a small collection, you have to be able to produce at scale to be of real interest.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The controversial device trapping CO2 in the ocean\n\u2022 What we've learned since Deepwater Horizon\n\u2022 The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery\nThat comes with a cost, however. Processing brewers' spent grain typically involves mechanical methods \u2013 using high pressure and temperature and spinning the grain in a centrifuge \u2013 or the use of strong acids and alkalis, all of which\u00a0are energy-intensive and can raise their own environmental questions. There is therefore an ongoing exploration of cheaper and more sophisticated methods to extract protein from spent grain, such as the use of bacteria and fungal enzymes to break down chemical bonds, for example.\u00a0\nLast year, a team in Singapore, funded by Heineken Asia, unveiled the use of fermentation to break down the chemical bonds in spent grain, which also resulted in the extracted protein \u2013 for use in foodstuffs \u2013 being richer in nutrients and fatty acids. In another step that might be widely applied, the researchers heated the spent grain using microwaves and found they could extract over 80% of its available protein content this way, the most harvested to date.\n\"Using microwaves is a difficult challenge, in their energy requirements, efficiency and scalability,\" says William Chen, professor of food science and technology at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore. \"But it's certainly possible to scale up [a microwave approach], or to find other ways of applying heat, through vibration, for example.\"\nThe overall objective is to move towards an \"ever more functional, higher value products\", he says. \"And we should be doing the same with [other protein-rich waste products such as] soybean residue, for example,\" he adds.\nArda's experiments may prove to be just the first steps in exploring the potential of spent grain beyond the edible. Antioxidant-rich brewers' spent grain could provide an eco-friendly alternative to the chemicals used in cosmetics, for instance, or used to replace the virgin fibres used in paper making.\u00a0\nRosa Arrigo, associate professor in inorganic chemistry at the University of Salford in the UK, says brewers' spent grain has a \"niche composition that's rich in chemicals [that] certainly have potential to [in time] be used to produce new materials\". Work at Salford to extract various organic compounds from brewers' spent grain is ongoing and Arrigo envisages these being used to make robust composite materials that could, for example, be bindable to the likes of concrete to make it stronger, more lightweight and more sustainable.\u00a0\n\"Certainly there's a whole other layer to what brewers' spent grain could bring beyond protein extraction for food,\" says Arrigo. \"Exactly what that is what we're now starting to examine.\" Doing this, though, could be expensive and complex, she adds. \"So we need further investigation to understand really what we have here, and what's actually needed by industry: what's good enough in terms of its quality but also economically feasible.\"\u00a0\nThe development of one such material is already underway: a group of researchers coordinated by University of Perugia, Italy, is currently working on a bioplastic derived from brewers' spent grain.\nCurrently, spent grain usually needs to be dried before it can be further processed, which is both time and energy consuming. But the Perugia team has developed a means of processing it while wet, critical to developing a bioplastic that could improve on the mechanical properties of those already available. The so-called Polymeer project hopes to have its first product \u2013 perhaps a biodegradable film wrap that could be used in packaging and agriculture \u2013 within four years.\n\"I think the true potential of brewers' spent grain has been overlooked, because even when the protein is removed there's still a lot of [useful] waste, the likes of lignin and cellulose, that has the potential to be a raw material [for other purposes],\" says Assunta Marrocchi associate professor in biotechnology at the University of Perugia and Polymeer's project coordinator. \"And the extraction of its additional components seems to be possible by relatively easy, low energy methods.\"\nBut what really matters here she adds, is that \"because almost everyone drinks beer, there's just so much of it to work with. It really is an incredible feedstock\".\nSo, the next time you're in the pub, perhaps you'll find yourself considering how the undertaking that put the beer in your glass might just prove an unexpected game-changer to both our diets and the materials we use.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 set itself on a path to a new vision of urban living that's now been emulated worldwide.\n\"It was a seminar in 1996 led by the mayor, which asked the question: 'What would it be like to live in a fossil free city?',\" explains Henrik Johansson, environmental strategist for V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Municipality. By the end of that meeting, a unanimous vote saw V\u00e4xj\u00f6 become the first city in the world to commit to become fossil fuel free. This has now evolved into a bigger target of climate neutrality by 2030 \u2013 15 years ahead of Sweden's nationwide commitment.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nV\u00e4xj\u00f6's groundbreaking 1990s commitment drew media coverage from as far afield as Japan, with TV crews ironically taking fuel-guzzling long-distance flights to visit the place Johansson wryly describes as \"this crazy town looking to go fossil free\". None of it seems crazy now, however, with V\u00e4xj\u00f6's per capita carbon emissions slashed by more than 70% \u00a0from 1990s levels, all while the city has grown in population by a third and doubled its per capita GDP.\nHere, local buses and council vehicles run on biofuel made from domestic household organic waste. More than 90% of the city's energy, meanwhile, is sourced from forestry by-products and other biomass, with plentiful material coming from the vast surrounding forests. This ranges from sawdust from local timber mills to branches left from tree-felling to make goods for IKEA \u2013 the global design giant born just a half hour train ride away in the town of \u00c4lmhult.\nThe few CO2 emissions that linger in the air stem from personal car users who are still not taking advantage of one of Sweden's best provisions of electric car charging stations, plus places to fill up on non-fossil biofuels such as ethanol.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe boldest transition, though, has seen V\u00e4xj\u00f6 become perhaps the world's leading showcase for large-scale timber architecture, with half of all new builds required to be in wood, sourced from the same sprawling forests that once provided fuel to fire the glasswork furnaces.\nI arrive in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 by train and can't help but start snapping pictures of a station interior unlike any I've ever seen. Stepping off the platform, I enter a seven-storey edifice that hosts both the Central Station and V\u00e4xj\u00f6 City Hall, and everywhere I look, there's wood. Here, timber is used for both structure and decor in a calm, soaring space that also includes a tourist office, exhibition area and eye-catching artworks made from pale wood. It's such a welcoming space that it's been nicknamed the city's public \"living room\".\u00a0\u00a0\nA wooden bridge connects the station with a museum quarter that I explore the next day, featuring the Swedish Glass Museum within the Sm\u00e5land Museum; plus the House of Emigrants, which tells the often revelatory story of Swedish mass emigration to North America.\nThe museum enclave is also home to myriad relocated buildings from past centuries \u2013 I particularly like the windmill as a symbol of ancient green power, built from timbers painted the iconic Swedish shade known as Falu or Falun Red, named after its historic source from mines around the eponymous town.\u00a0 \u00a0\nHeading down to the shore of Lake Trummen \u2013 one of two nearby lakes, along with sculpture-lined V\u00e4xj\u00f6sj\u00f6n \u2013 I potter along a trail of modern sculptures that provides a cultural promenade of contemporary works chosen and voted for by residents. Glass art is celebrated too, with contrasting crystalline creations placed along the cosmopolitan length of Sandg\u00e4rdsgatan that runs through the heart of the city centre to the iconic double-spired cathedral.\nPLAN YOUR TRIP\nHow to get there: A direct train from Copenhagen airport to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 takes 2.5 hours.\nWhere to stay: Modern design hotel PM & Vanner balances luxury with good eco practice.\nWhat to do\" Browse diverse brilliant glassworks dotted through the Sm\u00e5land countryside; head to the surprisingly inspirational IKEA Museum, and visit the lakeside medieval Kronoberg Castle five miles north of V\u00e4xj\u00f6.\nWhere to eat: The vintage decor at Kafe de Luxe celebrates stylish sustainable re-use. Galai offers upscale modern takes on superb Swedish produce in a chic, modern glass-box space.\nWhen to go: May-September for long days of Nordic sun and warmth.\nIt's a beautiful stroll, and I wonder whether people would have been so keen to leave Sweden if 19th-Century life had offered what the 21st-Century nation does. Alongside enviable public services and a famously equable society, I'm getting housing envy staring up at contrasting high-rise wooden apartment blocks that make up the award-winning Kvarteret Geologen residential complex (also known as Trummens Strand), standing tall and proud by the lake.\nHere, I'm joined by Olivia Thim, a sustainability expert for property management firm V\u00f6fab. \"For a long time, we had the tallest wooden building in Sweden,\" Thim says. \"But also a diversity: apartments, sports arenas, schools. We just thought that we should try to build everything in wood first.\"\nAlso with us is architect Karin H\u00e5rd Af Segerstad from leading V\u00e4xj\u00f6 practice Arkitektbolaget, who tells me about the super-strong cross-laminated timber (CLT) used for structural frames, augmented by cedar shaving facades and various interior woods. This swaddling in natural materials is as pleasing to the residents as it is to the eye, she says: \u201cPeople report an improved sense of well-being living surrounded by wood.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022\u00a0How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nFor architects and engineers, V\u00e4xj\u00f6's showcasing of innovative timber builds has been a valuable learning curve. \"People weren't so knowledgeable about wooden high-rise buildings, so we have close collaboration with the local university,\" says Segerstad. \"Every time there was a question, there would be research done.\"\u00a0\nThis includes sensors within buildings to record how the structures perform over years and changing seasons. \"Now we have researchers coming from around the world,\" she continues. \"Many from Austria and Germany, but also places in Africa such as Congo.\u00a0 We have become world pioneers to build in wood. Aesthetic principles are as important as ecological ones.\"\u00a0\nThe environmental drive underpinning V\u00e4xj\u00f6's modern wood architecture is matched by how the city powers its 21st century life. Exploring the city centre, I can see innovative new wooden structures next to historic clapboard buildings, many transformed into trendy shops or atmospheric restaurants, such as Kafe de Luxe where the traditional Swedish dishes rely on produce from the surrounding land and water.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe staying power of wood\nArkitektbolaget is building a new wooden Vias Chapel just outside the city that will provide a 21st-Century echo of Sweden's oldest wooden building, located 40km north of V\u00e4xj\u00f6. A visit to the 800-year-old Granhults Church proves not just the durability of wood, but also how well it works as a medium for art. An ornately painted interior is as ravishing in its own way as Rome's Sistine Chapel, while burnished medieval wooden carvings of various godly figures sit alongside humble timber furnishings.\nMeanwhile, at modern design hotel PM & Vanner, the restaurants focus on local, seasonal and organic dishes, including produce from the hotel's own garden \u2013 while dishes are cleaned using an energy- and water-saving dishwasher. Food waste is turned into biofuel, and the hotel is also part of an innovative textile recycling system.\nBefore I leave, I walk around the wood-decorated offices of local power generator VEAB with CEO Erik Tellgren, who tells me how forest and wood product \"waste\" taken from around V\u00e4xj\u00f6 easily provides all the electricity requirements of the city, in a manner that also helps the battle to mitigate climate change.\nCarbon Count\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 0.35 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"Forest residues left to decompose generate CO2,\" says Tellgren. \"So, using it up helps cut emissions.\" And, he adds, the ash produced from the burned wood is returned to the forest floor as an excellent compost.\nHe smiles as he recalls how V\u00e4xj\u00f6's first power plant, which fired up here beside the lake in the 1880s, burned wood, and now some 140 years later, the town is again relying on the material as it leads the world away from fossil fuels\n\"So we began with wood, and now we come back to it again,\" he says.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Abraham Lincoln's wife was long attacked for everything from her spending to her lack of emotional restraint. But with two new plays about her, she is finally getting better press.\nDuring last month's US presidential inauguration, as ever during these quadrennial celebrations, fierce interest focused on the First Lady. Much was made of Melania Trump's dresses, her enigmatic smiles, and especially the navy-blue wide-brimmed boater-style hat \u00a0she wore for the swearing-in. Was the hat a deliberate choice, to shield her face from the prying eyes of the public? No one could say, but legions speculated.\nHow unenviable is the lot of the President's wife, lacking in formal power but constantly judged \u2013 expected to be immaculately turned out, and to remain, in conduct, ever above reproach. The court of public opinion has found no First Lady more wanting than Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of Abraham Lincoln. Her husband, who emancipated the slaves, and saved the union, enjoys near-universal adulation, while Mrs Lincoln has been the subject of criticism and disapproval since her first days in Washington in 1861 when she embarked on plans for a lavish redecoration of the White House. She travelled to New York for a shopping spree, and reporters followed her everywhere. One for The New York Herald wrote: \"Mrs Lincoln, who has been engaged since her arrival in making large purchases at some of the leading merchants, was out yesterday enjoying herself in the usual way.\" \u00a0\nSuch reports did not go down well in the besieged, wartime capital. Indeed, the loyalty of the First Lady, who hailed from a slave-holding family, and had three half-brothers in the Confederate Army, was questioned throughout the Civil War. Even after her husband was shot on 14 April 1865 by Confederate supporter John Wilkes Booth, as he sat beside her in Ford's Theater, the public didn\u2019t embrace their hero's widow. In 1875, her own son had her committed to an insane asylum.\u00a0\nAnd yet today, in the era of TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook, where social esteem rises and falls capriciously on clicks and likes, the maligned Mary Todd Lincoln is getting some compassionate reassessment on the stage, most particularly in Mrs President, a new play by US historian, writer and artist John Ransom Phillips opening this week at London's Charing Cross Theatre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis two-hander centres on the relationship between Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Miriam Grace Edwards), and Mathew Brady, considered the father of American photo-journalism (Sam Jenkins-Shaw) who took iconic pictures of Abraham Lincoln, his family, and the battlefields of the bloody US Civil War. The new play imagines the First Lady, coming to Brady\u2019s studio to sit for her portrait, aware that she is an object of suspicion because of her southern heritage, and seeking an \"image that will define history\u2019s view of me\". Brady declares he has the power to do that. \"I shape the image of people who shape America. Past. Present. Future,\" he says. \u00a0\nIn Ransom Phillips' depiction, Mrs Lincoln demands to be addressed as Mrs President, and engages in an on-going verbal tug of war with Brady over how she should be portrayed. The play asks who controls the revelatory public image, the subject or the artist? This question transcends time and place, but has specific resonance for the former First Lady who sought, and believed she never received, proper recognition during her life for all she had done, and suffered. Later scenes follow Mrs Lincoln into her widowhood, and other controversial historical figures of mid-19th-Century America \u2013 abolitionist John Brown, Chief Justice Roger Taney, and naturalist John James Audubon \u2013 appear on stage, depicted by Jenkins-Shaw. Mrs President is a daringly kaleidoscopic look at the ownership of self.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn truth, Mary Todd Lincoln and Mathew Brady's relationship was a limited one. She did pose for Brady at his studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in November of 1861. When she saw the photographs, she was unhappy with how she looked and instructed that they all be destroyed, except for one she deemed \"passable\", in which she stands, and her face is seen in profile; Brady ignored this request and kept all the photographs in his archives. And later in Lincoln's term, she returned to the studio a few times, but it's not known if Brady took any other of her portraits, as he deputised much studio work to his assistants.\u00a0\nRansom Philips tells the BBC his aim with the play wasn't to document history but rather \"to rescue Mary Todd Lincoln from ridicule and caricature, and to show her as fully a person, a woman of complexity and depth of feeling \u2013\u00a0possessing the kind of emotionality that men often lack\". And his view of Brady is not totally benign. \"Brady is an artist, like I am, and I know artists can be tyrannous.\"\nIn a wildly different way, another theatre production currently running in New York is also sympathetic to the 16th First Lady. Oh, Mary! has been a huge word-of-mouth hit since it first premiered at the city's\u00a0Lucille Lortel Theatre in February 2024, before transferring to Broadway in the summer. This comedy, written by Cole Escola and described by The New York Times as \"gleefully tasteless\" and an \"unhinged historical fantasia\", depicts Mary as a lascivious, self-centered alcoholic who yearns to escape the White House and her nasty, neglectful husband so as to become a cabaret star. Until Escola turned over the role to Betty Gilpin last month, they themselves starred as Mary \u2013 in drag, shaking a mop-like wig of black barrel curls. All joking aside, and Oh, Mary! has numerous slapstick moments, the play's inspiration was Escola\u2019s own sense of identification with Mary \u2013 a woman who could be \"too much\" and was \"trapped in this role she was wrong for\", as Escola explained in an interview on NPR last year.\u00a0\nPerhaps unintentionally, Escola and Phillips have joined a century-long debate among historians over how Mary Lincoln should best be understood. Was she an energetic, ambitious young woman who recognised genius in Lincoln, a rough-hewn country lawyer, and propelled him to greatness? Or was she a volatile wife who made Lincoln's domestic life a living hell, hurling accusations \u00ad\u2013 and on occasion crockery \u2013 at him during regular fits of rage? Was she first unhinged by grief in 1850, when she lost her son Eddie at age three to tuberculosis? Or was it the loss of a second son, Willy, 12 years later, that really drove her mental health decline? Did she take bribes and pad expense accounts as First Lady? Or did she act as a valuable helpmeet, giving President Lincoln sage advice?\n\"In the public imagination she's multiple people \u2013 it all depends on who is examining her,\" historian Jason Emerson tells the BBC. Author of seven books on the Lincoln family, including The Madness of Mary Lincoln, Emerson is currently assembling a complete volume of the former First Lady's letters for the Lincoln Studies Center of the University of Illinois. \"Mary was a complex person, very human, and she made mistakes, as Lincoln did too. She is essentially a tragic figure.\"\nLoss haunted Mary's life starting at the age of six, when her mother died. After Mary's father remarried and sired nine children with his new wife, love was a scant commodity in the family home in Lexington, Kentucky. Mary escaped to Springfield, Illinois, where she lived with her elder sister. Vivacious in conversation and praised, too, for her pretty face and milky complexion, young Mary had many admirers. She found in Lincoln a man who shared her passion for poetry, theatre and Whig politics, and who was also nearly 10 years older and more than a foot taller. But rather than provide her with the steady paternal affection she missed out on as a child, Lincoln was often away from home, working as a lawyer on the Illinois judicial circuit. As introverted as his wife was extroverted, Lincoln struggled to respond to her emotional pleas for attention and sympathy.\n\"Temperamentally they were very different,\" Emerson says. \"And as she aged, her mental problems got worse, consistent with bi-polar issues.\" Emerson's study of Mary Lincoln and her extended family has convinced him that she suffered from the condition formerly known as manic depressive disorder, not widely diagnosed in the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe stresses on both Lincolns during their time in wartime Washington were immense, and Mary was determined to dress fashionably and entertain lavishly. \"She thought of herself as the Queen of America, doing what she was supposed to do as First Lady\" says Emerson. \"Her narcissism was perhaps her greatest vulnerability.\" But when their son Willie succumbed to typhoid in 1862, she refused to get out of bed for weeks and grieved so copiously her husband rebuked her.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What do these First Lady portraits reveal?\n\u2022 The Abraham Lincoln portrait that was a fake\n\u2022 The 17th-Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait\nPerhaps it was inevitable that this often unrestrained woman, would continue to get bad press after her death in 1882. William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, reinforced the most unflattering views of Mary Lincoln, in the biography he co-wrote in 1889 titled Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life. Herndon and Mary despised each other during Lincoln's lifetime and competed for his attention. In private Herndon called her a \"she-wolf\".\nFor many decades, Herndon's interpretation stood \u2013 Mary Todd Lincoln was regarded as a harridan married to a saint. But in the 1980s and 1990s, when scholars began to seriously reassess the role of women in history, the troubled First Lady got a fresh look. In 1987, Jean Baker, a historian at Maryland's Goucher College published Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, portraying the Lincoln marriage as fundamentally tolerant and loving, and Mary as a vital, behind-the-scenes participant in her husband's political career, consoling, advising and encouraging.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat view in turn, was contradicted by renowned Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame in his 2021 book An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. Burlingame believes Lincoln was made miserable by his wife, who, he believes, at times physically abused him, and posits she seduced Lincoln to force him to marry her \u2013 they were wed on a day's notice, their first child born a scant nine months later. And Burlingame is certain, based on evidence in US government archives, that she solicited bribes and sold permits and pardons while in the White House. Yet, the author credits Mary with fuelling Lincoln\u2019s rise. \"If he hadn't married a woman who was so ambitious and so willing to prod her husband and to goad him... he may not have gone as far as he did,\" the historian said in a recent interview for the History Unplugged podcast. Moreover, Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with difficult people, a gift constantly on display during his Presidency, had been honed by plenty of practice at home, in Burlingame's view.\nAuthor, too, of the definitive Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (2009) Burlingame was among numerous experts consulted by director Steven Spielberg for his 2012 hit film, Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the president and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The film portrays the First Lady in a generally positive light, and husband and wife as closely bonded. And yet Burlingame realised that Spielberg and scriptwriter Tony Kushner had closely studied his biography \u2013 which included his hypothesis about the hasty Lincoln wedding \u2013 when Day-Lewis (as Lincoln) and Field (as Mary Lincoln) argue over their eldest son Robert joining the army. He's in favour, she's opposed, and Mary accuses her husband of never liking the boy. \"You've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief,\" she says. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast.\nBut even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. And it's one of the pleasures of the play Mrs President to see the heroine put up a fight for her own identity, and ignore the often harsh and deprecating judgements rained down upon her both before and after her death.\nMrs President is at Charing Cross Theatre, London until March 16. Oh Mary! is booking at the Lyceum Theatre, New York until 28 June.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A hue now associated with innocence once had a murkier meaning: Kelly Grovier looks at the ways in which pink has represented violence and seduction.\nPink is a double-edged sword. While red is raucous and racy, and white is prim and pure, pink cuts both ways. Long before the word \u201cpink\u201d attached itself to the pretty pastel shade of delicate carnations, as we define the term today, the London underworld enlisted it for something rather less frilly or fragrant \u2013 to denote the act of stabbing someone with a sharp blade. \u201cHe pink\u2019d his Dubblet\u201d, so reads an entry for the word in a 17th-Century dictionary of street slang used by \u201cBeggars, Shoplifters, Highwaymen, Foot-Pads and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains\u201d, describing a lethal lunge through a man\u2019s padded jacket, \u201cHe run him through\u201d.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nAt what point the unlikely linguistic slide was made from mortal piercing to mellow pigment, no one can say for sure. But the enticing hue itself, by whatever name it was known before the assignment of \u201cpink\u201d to the colour chart in the 18th Century, has kept culture blushing since antiquity. Now seductive, now innocent, pink is coquettish and coy, sultry and sly.\nRemove pink from the palette of art history and a teasing dimension to the story of image-making would be lost. Edgar Degas\u2019s Pink Dancers would fall flat-footed and Pablo Picasso\u2019s pivotal pink period wouldn\u2019t rise to the occasion.\nA flesh in the pan\nA key moment in pink\u2019s emergence as an essential element in the development of painting is the creation by the Early Renaissance Italian painter Fra Angelico in the middle of the 15th Century of his famous fresco in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy, The Annunciation, which depicts the moment in the New Testament that the Virgin Mary is informed by the Archangel Gabriel that she will become the mother of Christ. Situated at the top of a staircase solemnly ascended daily by pious monks, Fra Angelico\u2019s ground-breaking painting is one into which an observer\u2019s spirit is summoned to levitate.\nCrucial to sparking that mystical lift-off in the fresco is the portrayal of the ethereal Archangel \u2013 who has himself mystically crossed planes of being to swoop into Mary\u2019s material sphere. Never mind the polychromatic wings, what\u2019s most surprising about Gabriel\u2019s depiction is Fra Angelico\u2019s decision to clad him in plush pleats of sumptuous pink.\nWe know from a contemporary artist\u2019s handbook on how to concoct pigments (Cennino Ceninni\u2019s Il libro dell'arte, published a few decades before Fra Angelico painted his fresco) that pink had been traditionally reserved primarily for the rendering of flesh. \u201cMade from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John\u2019s white\u201d, Cennini explains, \u201cthis pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls\u201d.\nBy draping Gabriel in the lushest of pinks, Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh. Pink is the pivot that humanises heaven. No one would ever see the colour the same way again. In the ensuing centuries, artists would invoke pink as shorthand for the blurring of boundaries.\nBloom of Christ\nAs the focus of Renaissance master Raphael\u2019s Madonna of the Pinks, a sprig of blushing carnations handed to the Virgin Mary by the infant Christ, may seem unremarkable enough at first glance. In fact it amounts to a kind of miraculous wrinkle in the fabric of time. According to religious tradition, dianthus (the Greek name for the plant, meaning \u201cflower of God\u201d), did not appear in the world until Mary wept at her son\u2019s crucifixion.\nThe flower\u2019s anachronistic appearance in Raphael\u2019s scene, therefore, tinged with the future blood of the baby who holds it, mysteriously establishes a pink kink in the linear unfolding of the universe.\nOver time, pink would eventually blossom beyond the petals of its complex theologies to inflect a wider array of secular personality, all the while retaining its elusive allure and capacity to tease. By the 18th Century, pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue.\nFamous portraits by the French Rococo portraitist Maurice Quentin de la Tour of Madame de Pompadour and by the English artist George Romney of his muse Emma, Lady Hamilton (later mistress of Lord Nelson), posing as a mythological maenad, reveal how decidedly deconsecrated the colour had become.\nLa Tour\u2019s full-length pastel-pencil portrait of the official chief mistress to Louis XV of France, begun around 1748, is a rumbunctious jungle gym of superfluous pinks that spider across every inch and threaten to suffocate its subject. Here, pink is an energy that vibrates from the sitter to the secular subjects with which Pompadour has surrounded herself \u2013 music, astronomy, and literature.\nPorcelain pink\nA patron of the porcelain trade, Pompadour had famously inspired the minting by the Sevres porcelain factory of a new hue of pink, delicately bruised by dabs of blue and black. To Pompadour, pink was no longer a mere accessory but a partner in crime \u2013 an aspirational second skin into which she grew intellectually and emotionally. She became her colour.\nNo painting embodies pink\u2019s gradual pendulum movement from the spiritual to the secular more vividly than the French artist Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s exuberant The Swing, painted around 1767, between La Tour\u2019s and Romney\u2019s works. Here, a fabulous flounce of flowing rose is frozen in mid swivel as the swinging girl, pillowed in pinkness, flicks loose a silk shoe, attracting the titillated attention of any number of camouflaged male gazes hiding in the bushes around her. We\u2019re a long way from the pink whisper of angels now.\nIn more recent times, pink continues to be seized upon by artists keen to confound our expectations of what notes or message the floral pigment can confidently carry. Having established a formidable reputation in the middle of the 20th Century as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist, eschewing figurative subjects entirely in the 1950s, Canadian-born American artist Philip Guston reached for pink in a dramatic turn back to representational art in the late 1960s.\nBy then, the colour itself had undergone something of a commercial transformation in American retail culture, having begun the century as a shade more often associated with boys and masculinity than fairy princesses and little girls\u2019 dolls. But by the time Guston began introducing a menacing cast of Ku Klux Klan-inspired cartoon goons, whose implausibly pale pink stubby hoods continue to menace popular imagination to this day, the colour had been re-commodified as delicate and feminine. Grabbing pink by the scruff for his unsettling scenes of a seedy Americana, Guston slaps Barbie across the chops.\nAt the same moment that Guston\u2019s provocative pink was poking the art world in the eye, scientific studies were underway by Alexander Schauss, Director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, to determine whether manipulations of the colour could help control the behaviour of subjects surrounded by it. The result of Schauss\u2019s investigation was the concoction of the psychologically subtle shade now known as \u201cBaker-Miller Pink\u201d, after the Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington where the pigment was successfully tested on the walls of inmates\u2019 cells and credited with a significant calming of aggressive urges.\nYet despite its ability to inspire docility, pink is still picking fights, challenging our perceptions to an aesthetic duel. Upon learning that the British artist Anish Kapoor had signed a contract giving him exclusive rights to a recently engineered colour known as Vantablack (the darkest shade ever devised), and the legal right to prohibit other artists from doing so, Kapoor\u2019s younger contemporary Stuart Semple saw red.\nEmboldened by Kapoor\u2019s black embargo, Semple began concocting a supremely-fluorescent pink paint he contends is the \u201cpinkest pink\u201d ever contemplated (\u201cno one has ever seen a pinker pink\u201d, he insists). As a poke in the eye of Kapoor, Semple has made his colour available at a small price to anyone in the world so long as they confirm that they are not Anish Kapoor nor friendly enough with Kapoor to share it with him. En garde, Kapoor. You\u2019ve been pink\u2019d.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Swimming holidays are the ultimate in slow travel \u2013 and since the pandemic, they've become more popular than ever.\nThe pale-blue copper domes of the church of Our Lady of the Rock were easy to spot as we swam across the Bay of Kotor from the picturesque fishing village of Dra\u017ein Vrt. So too were shoals of Adriatic fish: sardines, mackerel and sprats, as well as sea anemones and urchins. The water was crystal clear and almost Caribbean blue; and when my head was not in the water, the landscape was panoramic mountains.\u00a0\nThis delightful experience was the first day of a swimming holiday in and around the Montenegro fjords. It was not a vacation that involved lying on a beach and taking the occasional dip in the sea, but one where we travelled by swimming in a group while a boat transported our gear from place to place. A swimming holiday is the ultimate in slow travel, moving through the water from island to island and cove to cove, stopping for lunch in a historic town or tiny fishing village before returning to the sea to meander further around the coastline.\u00a0\nFor a while, it seemed that no matter how far we swam, the church sitting in the middle of the bay on a rocky promontory was not getting any closer. The swim itself was rewarding, through clear, warm waters surrounded by jagged mountains, but the goal was the islet where, according to legend, local seamen found an icon of the Madonna and Child on a rock. They then swore that after each safe journey they would add another rock until the landmass gradually emerged from the sea, crowned by a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\nSuddenly it hove into near view and within minutes we were climbing out of the water, attracting strange glances from a wedding party gathered outside. The crew on our safety boat passed us towels and clothes, enabling us to cover up so we could enter and admire the ornately painted interior. Most people arrive by boat to this popular tourist destination, but swimming all the way there gave me some sense of the relief those fishermen must have felt when they returned home safely.\n\"Swimming gives you a unique eye-view on the world because you are seeing it from ground or sea level,\" says Ella Foote, editor of Outdoor Swimmer Magazine and author of the book How to Wild Swim. \"But it's also that so much of the world developed around a body of water. Most major towns and cities grew up around rivers or alongside the coast, especially when water was the main method of transportation. In the modern world we have lost what was an all-important connection with water and it's fascinating to rediscover it and approach a new place from the water that surrounds or runs through it.\"\u00a0\nOur group (we wonder, should the collective noun be \"a goggle\"?) was made up of 15 swimmers, drawn from around the globe and ranging in age from 20 to 60-something. In common was a love of swimming. though our abilities differed from reasonably competent pool swimmers to open water veterans and seasoned triathletes.\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWe were split into three groups of similar speeds (identifiable by different coloured swimming caps). Each group was shadowed by a small inflatable boat, while a bigger boat transported us and our gear to and from each swim, as well as providing a base for lunch, changing and anyone wanting a break. On average we swam around 5km a day; a challenging distance that requires stamina and strength, but knowing I could opt out and sit on the boat at any point somehow made that challenge easier.\nLeisure swimming has long been popular in the UK, from Britain's \"Lost King\", Prince Henry Frederick Stuart, the older brother of Charles I, who died after contracting typhoid swimming in the Thames, to the Victorians who made sea-bathing resorts fashionable. But perhaps the greatest swimming \"pioneer\" was the romantic poet Lord Byron.\nIn 1820, a 22-year-old Byron swam across the Hellespont, a tumultuous four-mile strait in Turkey now called the Dardanelles. The swim from Troy in Greece to Gallipoli connects Europe with Asia and was famous in Greek mythology for Leander's nightly swims to meet his lover.\n\"I'd read Byron's accounts of his travels and the Hellespont swim and decided that's what I wanted to do for my 30th birthday,\" said Simon Murie, the founder of the world's first ever swimming holiday business, SwimTrek.\n\"I found that the hardest part was not the swim itself but getting the necessary permissions, working out the route and finding a boat to accompany me. I realised I could not be the only swimmer wanting to swim from place to place but suspected many were put off by the organisation and so I decided to set up a business that would do all that, leaving swimmers to train and turn up.\"\nAnd so, 21 years ago, SwimTrek, based on the UK south coast in Brighton, was launched to mixed reactions.\n\"Our first-ever trip was swimming from island to island in the Greek Cyclades. I had done all the preparation and booked accommodation, but on our first night, the hotel owner had given all our rooms away. She could not grasp the concept that we would actually be swimming there!\"\nThe mistake was remedied, and since then SwimTrek has expanded its operations from taking 100 swimmers to four locations in that first year to more than 3,000 travellers to 40 destinations around the world in 2024. Other companies have subsequently entered the market. Some offer a similar range of trips and destinations, while others, like The Big Blue Swim, specialise in a handful of Greek Islands.\nMy trip to Montenegro was with Strel Swimming, which operates mainly in and around the Mediterranean. Established in 2010 by father and son Martin and Borut Strel, the company built on experience garnered surrounding Martin's epic marathon swims.\n\"Martin was the first person to ever swim the entire length of the Amazon River, and I worked with him as a guide and expedition leader on this and his Yangtze, Mississippi, Danube and Parana river swims,\" says Borut. \"With all our knowledge and expertise, it made sense to open our own business. We started in Croatia and Slovenia in 2010, adding new trips and locations year on year.\u00a0Swimming is a low-impact activity on the environment, and since we use local hotels, restaurants, boats and guides, our groups contribute to the local economy.\"\nOn the third day of our trip, we swam around Mamula Island, home to an impressive Austro-Hungarian fortress built to guard the entrance to Kotor Bay. In World War Two it was used as a concentration camp.\u00a0\n\"I'll probably always remember that island, along with the waves and currents that changed as we swam around it, and I doubt that'd be true if I'd only seen it from the boat,\" said Nancy Meade, an attorney form Anchorage, Alaska. This was the second time she had come to explore Europe from the water. \"The special thing about a swimming holiday is that it combines being active and outdoors all day long with a great chance to explore in a unique way. Most tourists can walk out to the seashore, and maybe even take a boat tour or cruise, but actually spending the day on and in the water and seeing the many small towns from the water is very special. Being at eye level with the shore and rocks makes you feel a part of the place much more than if you just spent a week on a boat looking around.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Cheese, beer and a wonderful view\n\u2022\u00a0Why wild swimming is Britain's new craze\n\u2022\u00a0The River Waveney: The 'secret' UK waterway most Brits don't know\nThe rise of the swimming holiday goes hand in hand with an increase in outdoor and open water swimming generally. In the UK, this took place after the 2012 London Olympics, which featured the first open water-swimming event. Globally, wild swimming saw another boost during the pandemic, when most indoor sport was banned.\nNaturally, as with any sporting holiday, there are risks \u00ad\u2013 and safeguards against them. Trained guides check locations before swims and routes are amended if the weather or water conditions are unsuitable. Safety briefings are given at the start of each swim, and guides help and encourage less confident swimmers to get the most out of their trip.\u00a0\n\"Each trip has something special about it,\" says Marlys Cappaert who has worked as a SwimTrek guide for 10 years. \"I really like those moments when someone overcomes a fear or tries a swim that they didn't think they could do. The joy when they succeed is giddy. And it can become quite emotional, too. In my first year, at the end of a week, one lady came to me sobbing. She shared with me that six months earlier she had received a challenging medical diagnosis and was unsure if she'd even be well enough to make our trip, let alone complete the swims. But she had. By that point, the whole group was sobbing.\"\nOn our final day, we made our way along the coast of the Lu\u0161tica peninsula and swam into a former submarine tunnel where the Yugoslavian Navy once hid their underwater vessels, ready to emerge in the event of attack. It was eerily cold and dark inside and we were glad to emerge into daylight and head further down to the coast to the crystal-clear waters of the Blue Cave. Inside the grotto, sunlight reflected off the white-sand seabed and rendered the waters a shimmering turquoise. A few motorboats with tourists taking photos hovered near the mouth of the cave as we swam deep inside relishing the unique experience our mode of travel afforded us.\u00a0\nAs the great swimmer Lord Byron wrote in his poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimate:\n'There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,\nThere is a rapture on the lonely shore,\nThere is society where none intrudes\nBy the deep Sea, and music in its roar'\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "\"What my parents taught me is that they used to live in peace and calm, without having to have any fear in their own country,\" says 19-year-old Nick. \"I would like to live in a country where I don't have to be afraid.\"\nI meet him in a small bar on a street corner in the ex-mining town of Freiberg, Saxony \u2013 where he is playing darts.\nIt's a cold, foggy night in February with just over two weeks to go until Germany's national election.\nNick and his friend Dominic, who is 30, are backers or sympathetic to Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland - a party that has been consistently polling second in Germany for more than a year and a half, as the far right here and elsewhere in Europe attracts an increasing number of young people, particularly men, into its orbit.\nOne particular reason why Nick \u2013 and many other young German men \u2013 say they are afraid is the number of attacks in Germany involving suspects who were asylum seekers \u2013 most recently, the fatal stabbing of a toddler and a man in a park in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg. Immigration is now Nick and Dominic's main concern, although they don't oppose it in all forms.\n\"The people who integrate, who learn, who study here, do their work - I have no problems with them,\" says Dominic, though he is critical of anyone he sees as taking advantage of the asylum system.\n\"But these days such statements are seen as hostile,\" says Dominic. \"You're called a Nazi because of Germany's past.\"\nThe AfD  - which has long been accused of anti-migrant rhetoric - is celebrating endorsements from tech billionaire, Elon Musk, who owns the social media site X. He has hosted a live discussion with party leader Alice Weidel on the platform and dialled into a party rally.\nNow, as Germany waits to see just how well the far right does in the upcoming election, the question is why so many young men in particular are being drawn to the far right and what the consequences could be for a country that's deeply conscious of its Nazi past.\nPew research in 2024 found that 26% of German men had positive views of the AfD compared to 11% of women, and the share of men holding this opinion has risen 10 points since 2022.\nIn the elections for the European Parliament in 2024, according to German exit polls the number of under 24-year-olds, both male and female, who voted for the AfD in Germany rose to 16 per cent, up by 11 points from 2019.\nThis comes at a time of rising general anxiety among young people according to a recent study by the German Institute for Generational Research.\nIn a sample size of 1,000 Germans aged 16 to 25, anxiety levels were the highest amongst respondents who class themselves as far-right while they were the lowest amongst people who put themselves in the middle of the political spectrum.\nWomen were more likely to be concerned for their rights and those of minority groups while men were found to be more worried about conservative values that are less based around rights.\nDr R\u00fcdiger Maas, from the German think tank the Institute for Generational Research, says parties on the left often focus on themes such as feminism, equality and women's rights.\n\"Overall, men don't see themselves in these themes,\" he tells us. \"That is why they have a tendency to vote further right.\"\nHard, populist right parties have also done well in countries such as France, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Italy.\n\"Sixty per cent of young men under 30 would consider voting for the far right in EU countries and this is much higher than the share among women,\" says Prof Abou-Chadi, in analysis drawn from a subset of the 2024 European Election Study.\nAs well as gender, migration and economic issues, social media is playing a part. Platforms like TikTok allow political groups to bypass mainstream, traditional media, which the far right regard as hostile.\nIt's clear that AfD \"dominates\" TikTok when compared to other German parties, says Mauritius Dorn from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). It has 539,000 followers on its parliamentary account, compared to 158,000 for the SPD who currently have the most seats in the German parliament.\nAnd it isn't just official accounts but a \"considerable number of unofficial fan accounts also help to disseminate the party's content\", says Mr Dorn.\nThrough setting up 10 \"persona-based\" accounts with different user profiles, they found, \"those users who are more on the right-wing spectrum\u2026 see a lot of AfD content whereas users from the leftist spectrum see a more diverse set of political content.\"\nTikTok has said it doesn't \"differentiate\" between the right, left or centre of politics and works to stay at the \"forefront\" of tackling misinformation.\nDorn observes that other parties recognised sites such as TikTok \"too late\", which means they're playing catch-up in establishing a strong footprint on the platform.\nWe've met one AfD influencer, Celina Brychcy - a 25-year-old TikTokker who has more than 167,000 followers - 53% of whom are male, with 76% aged between 18 and 35.\nShe mainly shares dance, trend and lifestyle videos, but also pro-AfD content.\nMs Brychcy says she doesn't make money from promoting the AfD but does it because she believes in the cause and wants to \"get a message across\".\nHer political ideals include wanting the return of military service, more support for mothers who want or need to stay at home and stricter border controls.\nWhen I press her about whether her views amount to a rejection of multiculturalism she replied no, but believes people should \"integrate.\"\n\"There are certain people who just don't fit in with us Germans,\" she added but repeatedly insisted she is not racist and doesn't have \"anything against foreigners.\"\nMs Brychcy is also against \"role reversal\" when it comes to the way men and women dress.\nA reaction against \"gender ideology\" is another issue identified by Tarik Abou-Chadi, a professor of European Politics at the University of Oxford, as feeding far-right support amongst the young - something that is echoed by the Institute for Generational Research.\nThey asked first-time voters whether they found the LGBTQ+ trend \"\u00fcbertrieben\", which literally means \"exaggerated\" or over the top. The respondents who showed the highest level of agreement with that question were those who planned to support the AfD.\nWhen I challenge Ms Brychcy over whether that could be seen as retrograde, she replied that \"biologically speaking, we are men and women\" and thinks people should present accordingly.\nMs Brychcy tells me she has lost a couple of friends because of her politics - and now mostly spends time with those of a similar outlook.\nShe doesn't agree with those who view the AfD as a dangerous movement - rather one that would offer genuine, radical change.\nWhen I ask Ms Brychcy if she considers herself as far-right, she says that on certain issues - such as border control and crime, \"Definitely yes\".\nIt's a striking reply, particularly as often, the label of far-right is rejected by supporters of the AfD, including by the party leader, Alice Weidel, who insists she heads a conservative, libertarian movement.\nWith the horrors of the Nazis further and further in the past, this is a generation that's grown up with parties like the AfD - whether that's on TV talk shows or in parliament after the AfD got its first MPs in 2017.\nProf Abou-Chadi believes that the far right, generally, has become more normalised to the point, \"They don't seem so extreme any more.\"\nThat's despite party scandals such as a talisman of the AfD's hard right, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, being fined twice last year for using a Nazi slogan, though he denied doing so knowingly.\nThe AfD, in three German states, is classified as right-wing extremist by authorities - including in Saxony, a designation the party unsuccessfully challenged in court.\nIt's a state where the number of \"right-wing extremist individuals\" had reached a \"new high\" - according to a report released last year by Saxony's domestic intelligence service - that showed data back to 2015.\nIn a shopping mall in the city of Chemnitz in Saxony, we meet a group of young men who \u2013 while they won't go on the record \u2013 tell us they're right wing.\nDressed in black, with uniformly short hair, they express beliefs that homosexuality is wrong and fear that the German \"race\" is under threat because of the growing migrant community.\nThey question narratives about their country's past, seemingly a reference to the Nazi era.\nDiana Schwitalla has been teaching history and social studies for eight years. She says she has had to confront a case of Holocaust denial in the classroom and has heard other troubling remarks.\n\"We hear the Second World War was actually a good thing, and there was a reason people died then - and that this is good. Hitler is described as a good man,\" says Ms Schwitalla.\nShe adds, \"Many students\u2026 very young students, {who} say it doesn't matter who I vote for, they'll do what they want 'up there' anyway. The question of who's 'up there', I don't get an answer to that.\"\n\nWe met her over the course of two days - including at an adult vocational college in Freiberg that sits on the grounds of a former Nazi concentration camp. Jewish women, brought from Auschwitz, were used for slave labour here to make parts for aeroplanes.\nWe did hear some talk of opposition to the levels of immigration into Germany plus a desire for national pride.\nThe first day we met Ms Schwitalla, she is helping to organise a mock election for the students as a way of engaging them about democracy at another college site in the town of Fl\u00f6ha \u2013 about 15 miles away from Freiberg.\nWe spoke to Cora, Melina and Joey, all 18.\nCora says she has heard men of her age express a desire for women to be in the home harking back to a time \"when women took care of the children and when the husband comes home from work, the food is cooked\". She likens it to the so-called \"Trad Wife\" trend of adhering to traditional gender roles.\n\nCora and Melina voice fears about a rollback of women's rights \u2013 including on abortion, even - remarkably - the right to vote. \"Luckily that's not being discussed in politics yet,\" says Melina, \"but I've heard discussions about women not being allowed to vote in elections any more.\"\nA small group of students line up to vote around lunchtime and we watch as the results come in with \"Die Linke\" scoring top - the left party that's relatively popular amongst the young but polling at only around five per cent nationwide.\nThe AfD came second, reinforcing what Prof Abou-Chadi has found, that, \"younger people are much more likely to go for a further left or further right party than a centrist one\".\nThe AfD, whose signature issues include security, borders and migrant crime, are now even embracing the concept of \"remigration\" - a buzz-word in Europe's far right that's widely understood to mean mass deportations.\nSpeaking to people in Germany, it is clear that support for the AfD can not just be read as some form of protest vote, even if there is frustration with the parties that have traditionally governed Germany. Celina, Dominic and Nick - and others we spoke to - genuinely hope and believe that the AfD could set Germany on the path of radical change.\nIt's still the case that other parties will not go into coalition with the AfD but in January a non-binding motion was passed in the German parliament thanks to AfD votes for the first time.\nProf Abou-Chadi believes in the longer term, there could be an even more seismic change.\n\"And as soon as the more mainstream parties start giving up the 'firewall' or cordon sanitaire the far right will start cannibalising the right.\n\"It's very likely that, in many or most European countries, the far-right parties will be the main party on the right \u2013 or already are,\" he says.\nParties like the AfD have worked hard to try and normalise themselves in the eyes of the public.\nWhile there are people in Germany and Europe who view the far right as an extremist, even anti-democratic, force - it appears that the 'normalisation' effort is working, not least of all among the young.\nTop picture credit: Getty\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The respondents who showed the highest level of agreement with that question were those who planned to support the AfD.When I challenge Ms Brychcy over whether that could be seen as retrograde, she replied that \"biologically speaking, we are men and women\" and thinks people should present accordingly.Ms Brychcy tells me she has lost a couple of friends because of her politics - and now mostly spends time with those of a similar outlook.She doesn't agree with those who view the AfD as a dangerous movement - rather one that would offer genuine, radical change.When I ask Ms Brychcy if she considers herself as far-right, she says that on certain issues - such as border control and crime, \"Definitely yes\".It's a striking reply, particularly as often, the label of far-right is rejected by supporters of the AfD, including by the party leader, Alice Weidel, who insists she heads a conservative, libertarian movement.Getty ImagesDisplays of far-right support come as the horrors of Nazi Germany slip from living memoryWith the horrors of the Nazis further and further in the past, this is a generation that's grown up with parties like the AfD - whether that's on TV talk shows or in parliament after the AfD got its first MPs in 2017.Prof Abou-Chadi believes that the far right, generally, has become more normalised to the point, \"They don't seem so extreme any more. \"I meet him in a small bar on a street corner in the ex-mining town of Freiberg, Saxony \u2013 where he is playing darts.It's a cold, foggy night in February with just over two weeks to go until Germany's national election.Nick and his friend Dominic, who is 30, are backers or sympathetic to Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland - a party that has been consistently polling second in Germany for more than a year and a half, as the far right here and elsewhere in Europe attracts an increasing number of young people, particularly men, into its orbit.One particular reason why Nick \u2013 and many other young German men \u2013 say they are afraid is the number of attacks in Germany involving suspects who were asylum seekers \u2013 most recently, the fatal stabbing of a toddler and a man in a park in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg. \"A small group of students line up to vote around lunchtime and we watch as the results come in with \"Die Linke\" scoring top - the left party that's relatively popular amongst the young but polling at only around five per cent nationwide.The AfD came second, reinforcing what Prof Abou-Chadi has found, that, \"younger people are much more likely to go for a further left or further right party than a centrist one\".Not a protest voteThe AfD, whose signature issues include security, borders and migrant crime, are now even embracing the concept of \"remigration\" - a buzz-word in Europe's far right that's widely understood to mean mass deportations.Speaking to people in Germany, it is clear that support for the AfD can not just be read as some form of protest vote, even if there is frustration with the parties that have traditionally governed Germany. \"It's very likely that, in many or most European countries, the far-right parties will be the main party on the right \u2013 or already are,\" he says.Parties like the AfD have worked hard to try and normalise themselves in the eyes of the public.While there are people in Germany and Europe who view the far right as an extremist, even anti-democratic, force - it appears that the 'normalisation' effort is working, not least of all among the young.Top picture credit: GettyMore from InDepthBattered but defiant -  where does Hezbollah go from here?The tariff wars have begun - buckle upGreenland's dark history - and does it want Trump?BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.",

        "article_text": "In 1966, the BBC's Tomorrow's World visited a party in New York organised by the electronic dating service Tact, or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing. Around 2,000 singles were invited to Manhattan to try out this modern method of matchmaking.\nIn 1788, a man going by the name of \"AB\" placed New York's first known personal ad in the Impartial Gazetteer, according to historian Francesa Beauman. He was seeking a woman \"under 40, not deformed, and in possession of at least one thousand pounds\". Describing himself as \"a young gentleman of family and fortune, who is lately come to town\", the ad was the Tinder bio of its day. Whether AB had any replies to his ad is unknown. But nearly 200 years later, New York was the home of another novel approach to dating \u2013 computer matchmaking.\nInvented by Bob Ross (a computer programmer at IBM, not the painter), and accountant Lewis Altfest, Tact \u2013 or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing \u2013 launched in New York 60 years ago, in 1965. First confined to the Upper East Side, it soon expanded to the entire city and had thousands signing up to be matched by computer. Each hopeful had to pay $5 (\u00a32) and fill in a questionnaire, which would then be used to match people \"on three levels\", according to Ross: socio-cultural factors, opinions and values, and psychological factors. The answers were fed into the computer, which would then spit out supposed matches of the opposite gender. Same-sex dating was not an option. \"Tact is not a lonely-hearts club,\" Ross told the BBC's Tomorrow's World. \"It's not a marriage brokerage service. It's a new fun way of meeting new people.\" He pointed out that it was open to \"all fun-loving people between 18 and 45\", and added: \"People go into Tact for a number of reasons. Some of the people go into it just to meet new people, to get a lot of dates\u2026 some people want to get more serious, they are interested in forming a more lasting relationship, and then there are people who just want to get married.\"\nThe matchmaking questions were approved by psychologist Dr Salvatore V Didato, who felt there was \"a great social need\" for services such as Tact. He complained of other services, \"They say that they match people on many, many variables, but it winds up that they match them only on age, sex, religion, and height, or something like that.\" The Tact questionnaire went further by including a series of statements with which respondents had to either agree or disagree. The BBC report features responses from a typical customer: \"I worry over my relationships with people \u2013 yes. I enjoy people who express affection freely \u2013 yes. Most of the time I act as an independent \u2013 no. I enjoy going to parties \u2013 yes.\"\nWhile Tact was at the crest of a new technological wave, it was not quite the first computer-aided dating service. The two inventors had been inspired by Operation Match, which had been started earlier that year by Harvard students \u2013 decades before some students at the same university would create another computer-powered way for people to connect: Facebook.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nIn 1965, computers were still novel. Operation Match had to rent one of the university's computers for $100 an hour. It quickly proved popular, with thousands of students sending in questionnaires. \"You thought the computer was god, and the computer knew all,\" co-creator Jeff Tarr told the BBC's\u00a0Witness History\u00a0in 2014. Coincidentally, Tarr's daughter would go on to marry one of the creators of Match.com, one of the first internet dating sites. The computer provided reassurance: instead of relying on luck when finding your partner, you could be algorithmically matched to your soulmate.\nThe 1960s were a time of revolution. In the United States, the civil rights and second wave feminism movements were in full flow. Social norms were changing, and technology was developing quickly, too: the arrival of the computer coincided with society's increased permissiveness. By 1969, computer dating \u2013 or at least the idea of it \u2013 was mainstream enough to feature as a storyline in Bewitched, the supernatural sitcom. Samantha's cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery plays both characters) signs up to a computer dating service to find a mortal to marry, only to be matched with a warlock. Even Bob Ross himself found love through Tact \u2013 although it wasn't thanks to the computer. According to a New Yorker article published in the New Yorker in 2011, he eventually married a journalist who interviewed him about the project.\nTact's thousands of willing customers signalled a shift away from the more formal courtship culture of the first half of the century, and towards more modern attitudes. However, these early computer matchmaking services did not last long. While some people found their perfect partners, the services had a few fatal limitations. Because the services were primarily aimed at middle-class college students and graduates, there was a finite pool of potential matches. Also, the system was inefficient \u2013 it could be weeks between sending off your questionnaire and receiving your matches, who you then had to contact by phone or post. The parties organised by Tact were an attempt to get matches to mingle despite the distances that might be involved. Even then, it could still be awkward. The BBC's report pointed out that even \"a public relations man present couldn't get this party going until after dark,\" despite a prize of \"a big night out on the town\" for the most compatible couple present. Possibly the paper sign hung between two bins did not inspire confidence in the service.\nThe questions left something to be desired, too. As well as all the basic demographic and attraction-related queries, the form's \"dislikes\" section had options such as \"homosexuals\" and \"interracial couples\". The questionnaire also played to stereotypes: according to the New Yorker, men were asked to rank women's hairstyles, whereas women could specify where they could find their ideal man: chopping wood, painting in a studio, or in a garage.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The risqu\u00e9 romcom that defined a genre\n\u2022\u00a0The man behind the puzzle that 99% can't solve\n\u2022\u00a0Gloria Steinem on the trailblazing Ms Magazine\nWhile the creators were proud of the detail in their \"three levels\" of compatibility testing, their Cupid's arrows weren't always on target. \"We matched an older brother with his younger sister,\" admitted Ross. \"That didn't work out too well.\" He also said they'd had \"a number of people who weren't too satisfied after they've gone out\". On Tomorrow's World, one potential client quizzed Dr Didato on the robustness of the matching computer, after a bad experience with another service. \"She specified an age limit and gets some guy 20 years older!\"\nStill, while Tact, Operation Match and other similar services now seem comparatively quaint, people keep using technology to guide them towards romance \u2013 from the first personal ads in newspapers to video dating services, from online dating sites to AI-aided apps. According to Pew Research, one in 10 people who had partners in the US in 2023 met them via online dating. When it comes to matters of the heart, it seems, we can't help falling in love with the latest innovations.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "From Captain America: Brave New World to Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, these are the films to stream and watch at the cinema this month.\nThere are plenty of films about The Beatles, but Becoming Led Zeppelin is the first ever authorised documentary about the band that took over their mantle as one of the world's biggest and most influential rock groups. An intimate account of the foursome's pre-Zep careers and their early years together, the film is constructed from jovial interviews with the three surviving members, singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones, while a 1971 interview with John Bonham provides the late drummer's perspective. \"It's the personal confidences that stand out\" in this \"fascinating\" film, says Jonathan Romney in Uncut. \"A rich vein of anecdotes is found in Page and Jones's busy history as session players, with Jones particularly emerging as an affable raconteur with a juicy portfolio of anecdotes.\" James Bond trivia alert: as jobbing musicians, both Page and Jones were in Abbey Road Studios when Shirley Bassey recorded the theme song for Goldfinger.\nReleased on 5 February in the UK and Ireland, and on 7 February in the US, Canada, Australian, Spain and Sweden\nArmand is a provocative and weirdly comic Norwegian drama written and directed by Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, the grandson of two Scandinavian film legends, Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann. Renate Reinsve, the star of The Worst Person in the World, plays a famous actress who is summoned to her six-year-old son's school after he has been accused of sexually assaulting a classmate. Ushered into a room with the school's senior teachers and the alleged victim's parents, she is subjected to \"one of the most harrowing PT meetings ever witnessed\", says Jo-Ann Titmarsh in HeyUGuys. And as secret connections and shady agendas emerge, \"there is plenty of violence lurking beneath the surface of this middle-class tale\". The winner of the prize for best first feature film at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Armand is \"troubling, entertaining and at times confounding\".\nReleased on 7 February in the US, on 21 February in Spain, and on 28 February in Turkey\nI'm Still Here is already one of the stand-out successes of this year's awards season, having been nominated for the best picture, best international feature, and best actress Oscars. A Brazilian political thriller directed by Walter Salles (Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries), it tells the true story of Rubens and Eunice Paiva and their children. In 1971, they are living happily by the beach in Rio de Janeiro, but Rubens (Selton Mello), a former congressman, has been campaigning against the military dictatorship. When he is removed from his house by a team of policemen, it is up to his wife (the Oscar-nominated Fernanda Torres) to ask where he has been taken \u2013 and to keep asking, even when all hope seems lost. A longstanding family friend of the Paivas, Salles has made a \"deeply poignant\" drama, says Jessica Kiang in Variety, and his \"deeply invested film-making is remarkable in its grace and naturalism\".\nReleased on 14 February in the US, and on 21 February in the UK, Ireland and Spain\nThe classic Looney Tunes characters have featured in some of the greatest animated short films ever made, but they haven't been in any feature-length cartoons: instead, they've popped up in such animated/ live-action hybrids as Space Jam and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. But now, at last, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig star in their own 91-minute animation, a full nine decades after the characters made their debuts. The idea is that Daffy and Porky (both voiced by Eric Bauza) get a job in a bubblegum factory where they uncover an alien plot to take over the world. \"It's not consistently hilarious but it is consistently imaginative, sometimes even breathtaking,\" says William Bibbiani in The Wrap. \"The animation style evokes favourable comparisons to Max Fleischer and Don Bluth, with jaw-dropping backgrounds and fluid, energetic, expressive movement. It's the prettiest animated movie Warner Bros has released since The Iron Giant.\"\nReleased on 12 February in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and on 28 February in the US and India\nInspired by a Stephen King short story, The Monkey stars Theo James as a pair of twin brothers with a cursed wind-up toy monkey: ever since they were children, the toy has somehow caused people to die in extravagantly gory ways. The film is written and directed by Osgood Perkins, who made last year's creepy horror hit, Longlegs, but he promises that his follow-up is completely different. While Longlegs was infused with a gloomy atmosphere of dread and despair, The Monkey revels in the silliness of its premise. \"It's deliberately comedic,\" Perkins said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's feeling more like an old John Landis movie or a Joe Dante movie or a Robert Zemeckis movie. I saw an opportunity to make a wry, absurdist comedy about death... For me, the movie is a smile from top to bottom.\"\nReleased on 21 February in cinemas internationally\nIt's been 24 years since the first Bridget Jones film, and over eight years since the last one, but Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is back again in the fourth comedy to be based on Helen Fielding's bestselling novels. This time Bridget is a single mother dealing with the death of her husband, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth \u2013 who is due to appear in flashbacks). Leo Woodall (One Day) plays her much-younger love interest, Chiwetel Ejiofor is an eligible teacher at her children's school, and Hugh Grant has a cameo as her dastardly former boss, Daniel Cleaver. But will audiences still warm to the bumbling Bridget? Zellweger believes so. \"I think maybe folks recognise themselves in her and relate to her struggles and feelings of self-doubt,\" she said in British Vogue. \"Bridget is authentically herself and doesn't always get it right, but whatever her imperfections, she remains joyful and optimistic, carries on and triumphs in her own way. She seems to make her quirky individuality and shortcomings charming, lovable and acceptable \u2013 and, in turn, she makes us feel lovable and acceptable, too.\"\nReleased on 12, 13 and 14 February in cinemas internationally, and on 13 February on Peacock in the US\nAs a boy in the 1980s, Ke Huy Quan had major roles in two blockbusters, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Goonies, but acting work dried up soon afterwards. Decades on, he made a stunning comeback in the multiverse-spanning Everything Everywhere All at Once, and even won an Oscar for best supporting actor. Now he has his first ever leading role. Love Hurts is an action comedy in which Quan plays a geeky estate agent with a secret past as a gangland enforcer. The film's mix of gentle humour and nifty martial artistry seems ideal for him, but he wasn't sure whether to take the role until he consulted an old friend. \"I was at an event with Steven Spielberg and he was asking me, \u2018Ke, how are you doing?'\" Quan told Empire magazine. \"I said, 'Steven, I'm not doing so well.' Because of all the love and support that I had gotten during that whole award season, I was so worried that whatever I was going to do next, I would disappoint. I told him about this project and kind of pitched it to him. He said, 'Ke, it's great. Do it.'\"\nReleased on 7 February in cinemas internationally\nNow that Chris Evans is no longer playing Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the question is whether audiences will pay to see someone else wielding the character's patented red, white and blue shield. More specifically, will audiences pay to see Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson, who was Captain America's sidekick in earlier Marvel films, and has now been promoted to the title role? Judging by the trailers and the posters, studio executives seem to be hoping that another character will be the film's big draw. Filling in for the late William Hurt, Harrison Ford co-stars as Thaddeus Ross, a former US Army general \u2013 and arch-enemy of the Hulk \u2013 who has just been elected as US president. He hopes to count on the new Captain America's support, but their negotiations are interrupted when Ross is transformed into a bright red version of The Hulk. \"What we liked was this notion of a man who is trying to do the best he can but can't quite outrun the demons of his past,\" the film's producer, Nate Moore, told Entertainment Weekly. \"Turning a guy who hunted Hulks into a Hulk himself makes him more than an antagonist; it makes him a tragic character.\"\nReleased on 14 February in cinemas internationally\nA genre-mashing horror-romance-action film, The Gorge is directed by Scott Derrickson (Doctor Strange, The Black Phone), and it stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller. The concept, as dreamt up by screenwriter Zach Dean, is that two elite snipers are paid to spend a year in separate concrete observation towers on either side of a remote, misty valley. They have no high-tech means of communicating with each other, but they chat and flirt via flashcards and binoculars. The only obstacle in the way of this burgeoning relationship is that the valley is, apparently, \"the door to hell\", and their job is to stop monsters climbing out of it. The Gorge is a Valentine's Day release, and Teller thinks that it's the perfect film for the occasion, whether or not you're in the mood for love. \"Well, I just think it's good alternative programming, as well, to your typical love story,\" he told Screen Rant. \"They meet each other for the first time, and you're going to watch 'em fall in love. But they have to go through some really entertaining, engaging, high-octane, hellacious shit to end up with each other, so that's cool.\"\nReleased on 14 February on Apple TV+\nChristopher Andrews' debut film as writer-director could be the darkest and most brutal thriller about sheep-farming ever made. At its heart are two dysfunctional families with adjacent fields in the rural west of Ireland. Colm Meaney and Christopher Abbott play a taciturn father and son who are scraping a living on one farm; Barry Keoghan plays the feckless son of a rival couple (Nora-Jane Noone, Paul Ready) just down the road. When one family suspects the other of stealing two rams, the ensuing feud is as believable as anything in a down-to-earth kitchen sink drama, but with the twists and tension of a gangster film. And it could put you off eating lamb forever. \"Although hardly the first film to address toxic masculinity and the scourge of violence in small-town communities, this grimly compelling drama possesses a scruffy integrity,\" says Tim Grierson at Screen Daily. \"In Andrews' vision, rural Ireland is as harsh as the Old West.\"\nReleased on 7 February in the US, UK & Ireland\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier.\nBeware of green. It can\u2019t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment\u2019s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, \u201cvanishes into thin air\u201d. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso\u2019s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nTo dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green\u2019s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour \u2013 one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history.\nDonning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. \u201cLike the vampire,\u201d the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, \u201cshe has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave\u201d. Describing Leonardo\u2019s inscrutable sitter as \u201colder than the rocks among which she sits\u201d, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from \u201ca diver in deep seas\u201d to a savvy operator who has woven \u201cstrange webs with Eastern merchants\u201d. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant\u2019s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was \u201cthe mother of Helen of Troy\u201d and the \u201cmother Mary\u201d.\nLong before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris \u2013 ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh\u2019s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence.\nPerennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt\u2019s kings the path to resurrection.\nFlora and fauna\nFor millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the \u2018The Asp of Jerusalem\u2019. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade.\nAn acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he\u2019d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe\u2019s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012.\nFertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini\u2019s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy\u2019s bump in Jan van Eyck\u2019s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn\u2019t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal.\nAn alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green\u2019s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck\u2019s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao \u2013 his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple\u2019s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it\u2019s green.\nSo green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable\u2019s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting \u2013 a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured.\nThough rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour\u2019s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one\u2019s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation.\nHiding in plain sight\nIn more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin\u2019s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour\u2019s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue \u2013 as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond.\nBelgian surrealist painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist\u2019s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. \u201cEverything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,\u201d Magritte observed to an interviewer. \u201cThere is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.\u201d\nNo contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully\u2019s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse\u2019s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully\u2019s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer\u2019s space, the ficus greens of Scully\u2019s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "In Lithuania\u2019s Dz\u016bkija National Park, losing yourself amongst the pine trees while hunting for mushrooms is an occurrence so common it has its own word: \"nugrybauti\".\nThe thickening canopy of trees swallowed the last trace of sunlight, and with it, our sense of direction. Lifting our gaze from the forest floor, we noticed that the surrounding woods \u2013 minutes ago a familiar landscape of sun-dappled clearings and winding tracks \u2013 had been replaced by an expanse of dense brown shadows, suddenly foreign and disorienting.\nOur guide Tom Baltu\u0161is, owner of the foraging tour company Dz\u016bkijos Uoga, had noticed it too. \"In Lithuania, we have a specific word for this sensation. Nugrybauti: lost in the forest whilst hunting for mushrooms.\"\nTo a nation so fixated with foraging, these woods in Dj\u016bkija National Park in southern Lithuania hold a particular allure. Just an hour's drive from the capital Vilnius, the park \u2013 Lithuania's largest \u2013 is blanketed by dense pine forests, concealing a sprawling tapestry of bogs, black alder swamps and smoky marshland. It's a protected landscape that supports an astonishing abundance and variety of edible mushrooms.\u00a0\nForaging has long been a cornerstone of local life here, and the practice \u2013 once a necessity but now a beloved pastime \u2013 has shaped the region's living habits, cuisine and economy over the centuries.\u00a0\nNow, Dj\u016bkija's estimated 300 varieties of edible mushrooms draw mycophiles from around the world to this quiet corner of the Baltics, joining locals on the hunt for some of Europe's largest, rarest and finest fungi amidst unending tracts of pristine forest.\nDj\u016bkija's unique soil composition was shaped thousands of years ago when ice age glaciers left behind vast sand deposits across the region. The moist, well-draining ground conditions that resulted provide the ideal environment for extensive fungal networks (mycelium) to thrive underground, exchanging nutrients with the park's millions of pine trees in a process known as ectomycorrhiza.\n\"It's a paradise for mushrooms, but this sandy, infertile soil made agriculture impossible here,\" Baltu\u0161is explains. \"We can only grow a small handful of crops, so the primary source of food and income has always been the forest. For centuries, families hunted, foraged for berries and collected mushrooms, which not only provided sustenance for themselves but also allowed them to sell forest produce to surrounding regions.\"\nRemnants of Dj\u016bkija's booming mushroom trade remain in isolated villages like Zervynos (pictured above), where locals once sourced, dried and cured the region's fungi to be sent to chefs and Soviet elites in Vilnius, Warsaw and St Petersburg. Gr\u016btas Park, located 40km to the west, is an exhibition of USSR-era monuments collected by Viliumas Malinauskas, Lithuania's \"Mushroom Millionaire\", whose business exporting Dz\u016bkija's mushrooms to the rest of Europe made him, for a time in the 1990s, one of the country's wealthiest men.\nToday, the dozens of cars dotting the highway, bonnets heavy with boxes of chanterelles, signal Dj\u016bkija's more modest mushroom trade. One roadside vendor, Agn\u0117, tells me that \"foraging was once a means of survival. Now, it's simply a way of life.\"\nGrybautojas (mushroom hunters) here are among Europe's most discerning, closely tracking rainfall, humidity and even the lunar cycle, believed by some to stir up groundwater and influence the fructification of their favourite varieties. Most pick more than they can eat, selling the excess to passing travellers.\u00a0\n\"Foragers in Dz\u016bkija know exactly how to find what they're looking for,\" said Baltu\u0161is, as we picked our way through a clearing. \"Porcini like to grow near white moss and oak trees; red-capped scaler stalks prefer birch groves; chanterelles enjoy growing among junipers.\"\u00a0\n\"And of course, every local keeps their favourite spots a sworn secret. If you ask anybody in Dj\u016bkija where to find the best mushrooms, they'll simply reply, 'In the forest'.\"\nBaltu\u0161is tells me that an estimated 300 varieties of mushrooms are consumed across Dj\u016bkija's dozens of villages and hamlets, and he lists them off as we wind through the trees. \"Chantarelles, milkcap, honey fungus, boletus, chicken of the woods.\" But pinning down an exact number is difficult, he adds, \"as some species considered poisonous elsewhere are often enjoyed by the park's most experienced foragers\".\nSpecies like honey fungus, considered mildly toxic in countries like Norway, are parboiled by some in Dj\u016bkija to safely consume in soups; whilst false morels \u2013 deep brown, wrinkled and often deadly when eaten raw \u2013 are among the first spring mushrooms prized by seasoned grybautojas in Dz\u016bkija, boiled intensively between three to five times to fully extract any toxins.\n\"The sheer abundance and variety of mushrooms here, along with the beautiful natural scenery, is what attracts enthusiasts from all over the world,\" says Regina Baltu\u0161ien\u0117, who co-owns Dz\u016bkijos Uoga with Tom, her partner.\nSpecialising in eco-tourism, they lead foraging excursions from their traditional hamlet homestead and offer expert guidance in safely hunting for baskets of Dj\u016bkija's wild mushrooms, hosting foragers from around the world to help them uncover the region's very best.\n\"Many guests coming to Lithuania are fascinated by our leisure activity,\" says Tom. \"In a globalising world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find traditions so specific to one particular region, but mushroom picking offers the perfect chance to experience Dj\u016bkija's culture and nature simultaneously\".\nAs mushroom season gets underway in late August, locals in Dj\u016bkija seize the opportunity to incorporate the park's fungi \u2013 whether dried, cured, crushed or powdered \u2013 into the country's most popular meat, fish and potato dishes before December brings foraging to an abrupt, frosty end.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The chefs reclaiming Lithuania's cuisine\n\u2022\u00a0The European region where young people are happiest\n\u2022\u00a0Are Lithuanians obsessed with bees?\nThe flavorful bavarykas mushroom is stuffed into cepelinai (parcels of thick potato dough); while gryb\u0173 sriuba (Lithuania's ubiquitous mushroom soup) and kugelis (potato pudding) take on Dj\u016bkija's abundant porcini and boletus. Butter-fried russulas, saffron milk caps and parasol mushrooms, with their distinctive meat-like flavour, are all popular appetisers.\n\"Here, everyone can freely pick mushrooms and berries, except in state-protected areas and territories,\" says Regina. The country's \"Right to Roam\" laws, based on the principle of \"everyman's right\" \u2013 the legal concept that argues that the wilderness ought to remain open to all for recreational activity \u2013 allow citizens to access natural resources, such as Dj\u016bkija's mushrooms and berries, even on private property, so long as the privacy of homeowners is respected.\n\"Indeed, in Lithuania, forest owners are required to allow everyone to pick mushrooms on their land,\" she adds.\n\"Mushroom picking is a part of life and identity for the residents of Dz\u016bkija, who have been foraging since childhood, learning about every species from their parents and grandparents,\" says Regina. Education centres in the regional hub of Var\u0117na, affectionately referred to as Dj\u016bkija\u2019s \"Capital of Mushrooms\", and the town's annual Mushroom Festival are part of an effort to keep the park\u2019s traditions alive, teaching younger generations about the cultural significance and lifestyle benefits of foraging.\u00a0\n\"If our mushroom-picking tradition is not preserved, the region will lose its identity and future generations will miss out twofold,\" Regina says. \"On both a wonderful pastime and the delicious dishes made from Dj\u016bkija's freshly gathered wild mushrooms.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "While the formal dress and classic dances of the Vienna balls have prevailed since the early 1800s, some events are taking unique approaches to the tradition.\nSince the early 1800s, locals and visitors have been gathering in the ballrooms of Vienna, Austria, to waltz the night away. Originally organised to entertain distinguished nobles and politicians gathered in the capital after the Congress of Vienna, the annual ball tradition has continued into the present day with thousands of people breaking out their finest clothing and gliding across dancefloors under magnificent chandeliers.\nThe city's ball season starts in November and continues until Shrove Tuesday (4 March 2025), with January and February marking the peak of the season. More than 450 balls take place in Vienna each year. These are typically formal and ceremonial affairs with a strict dress code of ball gowns and tuxedos, where modern accessories like wrist watches are considered a considered a faux pas. However, in recent years, more unique events have cropped up as well, led largely by a younger generation.\n\"There are more modern balls \u2013 young in both their origins and audience \u2013 where the dress codes are more relaxed,\" says Helena Steinhart, PR manager of the Vienna Tourist Board.\nDress Code\nWhile the dress code varies, female attendees are generally expected to wear floor-length evening gowns, while men typically don black tailcoats with a white bow tie and black shoes. For those who don't want to bring their formal attire, there are plenty of rental opportunities available in the city during the season.\nIf you're interested in attending a ball this year, a full list can be found online, with each dance selling tickets or spaces on the waiting list on their own sites.\nOne example is the annual Wiener Hip-hop Ball (15 February 2025). Launched five years ago, this ball is a fascinating blend of old and new, where participants pair traditional formal dress with trainers and dance to hip-hop music rather than the waltz.\nFor an even more relaxed ball experience, visitors can attend the Sweatpants Ball on 1 March. \"The dress code is, quite literally, in the name,\" quipped Steinhart.\u00a0\nMany newer balls have also been launched to create space for communities who might be uncomfortable at some of the more traditional events. The Rainbow Ball, for example, which took place on 25 January, specifically caters to the LGBT community and features a welcoming atmosphere for same-sex dancing couples.\nOther interesting events include the annual Vegan Ball, which includes a vegan gala dinner; and the Comic Con ball, where guests are encouraged to show up in cosplay as their favourite character.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A designer's guide to artisanal shopping in Vienna\n\u2022 What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022 A queer dance champion's guide to experiencing queer tango in Buenos Aires\nTickets for this year's ball season are still available, though some of the larger and more well-known balls, such as the Opera Ball (27 February 2025) are waiting list only. Resale tickets can sometimes be found online, though Steinhart cautions that this option is best for German speakers as there's no formal website to find them. Visitors can also book a tour package that includes a ball experience; or stay at one of several hotels in Vienna that offer ball-themed packages, such as the one at Almanac Palais.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Marcel Duchamp\u2019s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart \u2013 and at its 17th-Century predecessor.\nThis year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history \u2013 a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.\nMore like this:\n- When the Parthenon had dazzling colours\n- The insect that painted Europe red\n- The subversive power of the pipe\nThe work in question is awkwardly proportioned \u2013 over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall \u2013 and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um\u2019, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m\u2019ennuies, or \u2018you bore me\u2019) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making \u2013 found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel \u2013 that he christened \u2018readymades\u2019.\nIn stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, \u201cDuchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.\u201d Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.\nAnyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these \u2018readymade\u2019 swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp\u2019s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp\u2019s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp\u2019s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues \u2013 a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades \u2013 a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp\u2019s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of \u2018A. Boogert\u2019 \u2013 a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert\u2019s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel\u2019s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author\u2019s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp\u2019s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert\u2019s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp\u2019s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life\u2019s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "summary": "Key power station didn't properly disclose burning forest wood2 days agoJoe CrowleyBBC NewsGetty ImagesDrax failed to report the burning of wood from primary forests in Canada, BBC News foundA UK power station that has received billions of pounds in government subsidies has failed more than once to report it burned wood from primary forests, BBC News has found.Drax Power Station, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood and whether it is from natural, previously untouched forests.The company paid a \u00a325m penalty last year for misreporting this data following an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and now the BBC has discovered a further year of misreporting that has not been looked at by the regulator.The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.Getty ImagesDrax generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricityDrax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. \"The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax. \"Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"The situation we inherited for large scale biomass generators was unacceptable. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU. \"Ofgem required a further audit to be undertaken and they are working closely with Drax to ensure any misreporting does not happen again.",

        "article_text": "'The second Special One' - Amorim, by those who know him best\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\"Ruben replied: 'I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\nRuben Amorim (left) pictured in the Benfica boys' team along with friends Bruno Simao (second right) and Pedro Russiano (right)\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls. \n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch on BBC iPlayer: Who is Ruben Amorim?\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\nThis video can not be played\n'The second special one' - Amorim by those who know him\nSpecial One? I'm the Smiling One, says Amorim\nI was told it was now or never - Amorim on Man Utd move\nAmorim tactics: Ending the 'donut' and taming Fernandes - what's in store?\nAmorim at Belenenses, where he established himself as a top-flight midfielder in Portugal\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?' \n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\nAmorim (second left) with Professor Antonio Veloso (left) at the University of Lisbon \nThis video can not be played\nAmorim told he couldn't delay Man Utd move till summer\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia. \n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.' \n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\" \nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources. \n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\nAmorim's Portuguese Football Federation card when he did a coaching internship at Casa Pia\nAmorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\" \nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\" \nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\nUnited then spent about \u00a3600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one EFL Cup before he was sacked last month.\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\"The job is too big for him at the moment,\" England-based John said outside the Estadio Jose Alvalade. \"I don't think Ruben has had enough years here and he's also inheriting a lot of prima donna players at Manchester United.\n\"He's a great coach but he hasn't got enough experience.\"\nA poster in Sporting's club shop celebrating the 2023-24 title win \nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.\"\nA version of this feature was first published on BBC Sport on 2 November.\nEdited by Alice McKeegan\nAdditional reporting by Olga Monteiro\nA sticker of Ruben Amorim when he was at Benfica in 2014-15\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "With a fresh fizz and hoppy scent, a cold beer is a drink that touches all of our senses. But as our climate changes, so too might the flavour profile of one of the world's most popular drinks.\nWith its satisfying, tantalising flavour, few drinks evoke as familiar a feeling as a freshly poured beer. \"It's not only bitter, it's not only sweet, it almost invites you to a next sip, and that's a very difficult quality to describe,\" says Mirek Trnka, a researcher at the Global Change Research Institute Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.\u00a0\nThe flavour of beer is created by a complex symphony of chemical compounds from three ingredients; hops, yeast and malted barley. But now climate change is threatening the production of two of those \u2013 barley and hops. Trnka and his colleagues say that the traditional crops that brewers rely on to create beer \u2013 called noble hops \u2013 will become \"more difficult to grow\".\nTrnka\u2019s research shows that production of noble hops has decreased by 20% since the 1970s in some of Europe's biggest hop-growing regions. Alpha acids are the key compound in noble hops that give beer its distinctive bitter flavour and Trnka's study concludes that levels of alpha acids will decrease by 31% by 2050. Is beer facing an existential crisis? Can anything be done to secure its flavour in the future?\nBeer, one of the world's favourite drinks, and the most popular alcoholic beverage by volume, has been a part of society since humanity discovered agriculture. Evidence of grain-based fermented alcoholic drinks has been found as far and wide as Jiahu, a Neolithic site in China dating to at least 5700 BC, and prehispanic Andean societies, such as the Moche culture from the Second to the Eighth Century AD. In the Near East, Mesopotamian cuneiform texts and seals depict beer being drunk. In fact, there is evidence of beer being made on every continent in the ancient world.\nWhether it was corn, rice or cereal, early farmers learnt that fermenting grain could produce a drink with intoxicating effects. It was as much a social lubricant for people in the ancient world as it is in pubs and bars the world over today.\nInitially, hops were added as a preservative, not a flavouring. \"It was discovered during medieval ages that hops added an antimicrobial benefit to the beer, preventing the beer from spoiling in a manner that would make it sour\u00a0\u2013 so it added shelf life,\" says Thomas Shellhammer, a professor of fermentation science at Oregon State University.\u00a0\nHow is beer made?\nBeer is traditionally made from four ingredients: water, malted barley, yeast and hops.\nBarley kernels are soaked in water to soften the husk and start the germination process. They\u00a0 are then drained and dried in a kiln to halt germination. As they begin to sprout, the enzyme amylase converts the starch stored in the kernel into sugars. These are important for the flavour of the beer, and as a food source for yeast, which later will ferment the beer to make alcohol.\u00a0\nOnce dried, they are roasted in a kiln. The longer and hotter the roast, the darker the final colour and the richer and more toasted the final flavour.\nNext, the malted barley is milled and mashed with hot water to release the sugars. The mixture is then boiled with dried hops, and cooled to around 20C (68F) for ales and 12C (54F) for lagers. Once cool, yeast is added. The fermentation stage usually takes several weeks, before the beer is filtered and bottled.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of kilns and stainless steel vats, hops would have been dried over fires which would also have imparted a strong smokey flavour to the beer, says Shellhammer. It was only possible to develop light, hoppy lagers after the Industrial Revolution and the widespread use of steel. Malt has a sweet aroma and flavour, so hops are key to balance out this sweetness with bitter flavours from hops. \"The aromatic flavour of hops became as important as other elements, rather than just being functional to the process of making beer.\"\nThese early beers would have been weaker in alcohol and highly variable in flavour. In early beer making, a \"universe of herbs and spices\" other than hops would have been used as alternative flavourings and preservatives,\u00a0including heather flowers, spruce tips, sage, rosemary and juniper.\nThe antimicrobial properties are created by some compounds in the hops called alpha acids and beta acids, which are also the source of beer's bitter taste. \"During the boiling stage, the alpha acids isomerise [change shape] into another compound, and that chemical reconfiguration makes them more bitter,\" says Shellhammer. Very bitter beers, like Indian pale ales (IPAs) are made with hops with a high alpha-acid content to really accentuate those bitter flavours.\nThe popularity of hops really took off after the Industrial Revolution, says Trnka, because the flavour profile shone through in clearer, lighter beers. The consistency with which brewers could make tasty beers with hops pushed this crop ahead of other flavorings in popularity.\u00a0\nNowhere did lighter beers take off more than in Central Europe \u2013 particularly in the regions that are now in Czechia, Slovakia and Germany \u2013 where lager was invented. The hops grown here, called noble hops, have become highly esteemed for giving lagers their distinctive flavour. \"This is a relatively traditional industry,\" says Trnka. \"You get a premium if you grow these noble hops, these old cultivars, especially in Czechia where it is part of 100 years of tradition.\"\nTrnka and his colleagues' climate research focused on noble hop varieties. Rising temperatures caused by climate change have moved the start of the noble hop growing season in Germany and Czechia by 13 days between 1970 and 2018, and ripening has moved 20 days earlier. Trnka's projections suggest that by 2050 noble hop yields will decline between 4.1 and 18.4% when compared to 1989-2018, along with a similar drop in the alpha acid content, due to rising temperatures and more frequent droughts.\nWhile some effects of higher temperatures and droughts can be overcome with irrigation, says Shellhammer, at very high temperatures of around 46C (116F) plants stop growing, and some diseases thrive in hotter temperatures.\n\"But, if you want to grow the same hops as our forefathers grew from 19th Century, or even before, these noble hops that are very prized for the light lagers that Czechia is so famous for, there are ways to adapt,\" says Trnka.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why veg is growing in empty offices\n\u2022\u00a0The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022\u00a0Is alcohol a secret polluter?\nHop farmers have a few options: relocating hops to areas with higher water tables, for example in valleys or by streams, where water is more easily taken up by plant roots, adding drip irrigation or switching to more climate-resistant varieties. These have all proven successful strategies in wine-making, where viticulture is also threatened by climate change.\u00a0\nIn some ways, says Shellhammer, beer makers are luckier than vintners, who are solely reliant on one ingredient \u2013 grapes \u2013 while they can adjust yeast, malt and hops to perfect a flavour.\nBut not all of these solutions will be easy to implement, warns Chuck Skypeck, technical brewing projects director at the Brewers' Association in the US. Irrigation is more common in North America than it is in Europe, and is costly to introduce, says Skypeck. Switching varieties is also easier said than done. Hops are perennial crops, meaning the plant remains in the soil every year. Like other perennial crops, such as tea, coffee or grapes, changing cultivar would require digging up the entire plant, he says. Changing grain cultivars is much easier as each year new crops are sown from seed.\nBut Shellhammer thinks that switching hop varieties might only result in a couple of years of reduced yield. \"In the Northwest United States, I've spoken to growers that say they could switch out a crop and get close to 75% of the yield in the first year,\" he says. \"With wine grapes, you're waiting for a whole grapevine to grow and produce \u2013 so it's a multi-year endeavour.\"\u00a0\nSkypeck adds that breeding programmes in place in North America and all the major hop-growing regions are focused on new varieties for changing flavours and aromas, and finding varieties that are adapted better to changing climatic conditions. Those adaptations include deeper, denser root structures that are more drought resistant. These new varieties are proving popular with artisan brewers and brewers of bitters and ales. \"It's driven a lot of the craft and independent beer movement in the US,\" he says.\u00a0\nNew hop varieties are being bred to be more resistant to the changing climate, says Skypeck, but to develop a new hop variety from scratch to full production can take up to 10 years. For example, a new experimental variety may show more heat resistance but might still require a similar amount of water, he says. \"Brewers take different approaches as well. US craft brewers rarely only use one variety of hops in their beers, rather layering different flavours and aromas to create the different character you find in many craft beers. On the other hand, more conservative traditional German brewers can be reluctant to adopt new varieties because they don't want to change the character of their beers that has been consistent for years.\"\nChristian Ettinger, founder of Hopworks Urban Brewery in Portland, US, says that one of their typical beers might contain between two and five different varieties of hops, which gives the brewer scope to adjust the recipe to account for changes in yields. \"Selecting hops and forecasting is difficult, and it requires you to go spreadsheet by spreadsheet, tune your recipes, look at your overall volumes,\" he says.\nWater scarcity is one major contributor to low yields in the US, which drives the cost of hops up, says Ettinger. \"Beer has been the most popular alcohol beverage for 9,000 years, and part of that is it's accessibility and affordability. It's incumbent upon us as cultivators to make sure it's still accessible.\"\nEttinger has been brewing beer for 30 years and in that time has seen how the industry has adjusted to climate change by introducing regenerative agricultural techniques like cover cropping \u2013 which involves growing other crops between the hop plants to suppress weeds, reduce erosion and improve soil health \u2013 and biochar \u2013 which is the addition of carbon-rich, organic material that improves water retention in the soil. \"The beautiful part about sustainability is you're trying to minimise your footprint, because it is better for the planet, and it is less expensive \u2013 it makes you more efficient and economically competitive.\"\u00a0\nA recent trend in the US is for \"fresh hop beers\" which are produced with hops that celebrate the uniqueness of that year's harvest, says Skypeck. \"There's consumers that are interested in experimentation and variety.\"\u00a0\nWhether consumers embrace a more varied palette of beers or stick to familiar lagers, \"it's not going to be the end of the world,\" says Trnka. \"We will still be able to make beer.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "\"Wembley is a lovely stadium. It's a lovely stadium to have a meltdown at.\"\nLewis Brownhill - the older brother of Burnley midfielder Josh - is one of about 5,000 candidates worldwide preparing to sit Fifa's exam to become a licensed football agent.\nBrownhill, 37, is a chief technician in the RAF, with three tours of Afghanistan during almost 20 years of service. \nHe also works as a scout for the Cassius Sports agency, which represents his brother along with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill.\n\"I feel more nervous, genuinely, than going to Afghanistan,\" Brownhill says.\n\"I had set my goal to be an agent. I always put a bit of pressure on myself to pass exams but because it was the next stage of my career I had to make sure I was able to do it.\n\"It doesn't help that the exam has had such a low pass rate, that's where the pressure comes from.\"\nBut can anyone become an agent? Why? How does it work? \nI attempted to find out by sitting Fifa's agent exam...\nThe Great Hall at Wembley hosted the Fifa exam in November \nIt's 8.30am on a cold November day in north London and we are shuffling up an escalator towards the Great Hall at Wembley Stadium to take a seat at one of 300 desks lined up in classic school exam style. \nThere are two pieces of paper and a pen on each desk.\nWe will face 20 multiple-choice questions in one nerve-wracking hour on everything from sell-on clauses to when agents can approach minors. You need to answer at least 75% (15 questions) correctly to pass.\nThe \u00a3300 entry fee at least gets you a bottle of water, accompanied by a shiver of GCSE dread from decades past. \nBut it also gives you a shot at the career of a lifetime as a Fifa-licensed agent in the glamorous world of professional football.\nThere are approximately 7,000 licensed agents worldwide, and during next month's January transfer window I'll be speaking to many of them - good and bad - to work out which players are going where.\nSome are understandably driven by their own agendas - the best interests for their clients and their agency.\nFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had an outspoken distaste for some agents, describing them as having an \"imagination beyond belief\" during negotiations over transfers, new contracts or pay rises.\n\"You get agents who buy [players'] groceries, do their travel, polish their boots,\" he said in 2011. \"That is the kind of human being you are having to deal with. Some dominate their lives.\"\nPremier League clubs spent more than \u00a3400m on agent fees in the year to February 2024, which can conjure up the caricature of a larger-than-life 'super agent' such as the late Mino Raiola.\nA far more realistic description of an agent is the well-travelled former EFL player who has years of real-life experience, which they then pass on to their clients.\nThere are also parents or close relatives looking to represent family members themselves - which some within the industry are critical of.\n\"There have been a lot of players damaged by not having proper agents - chancers who were able to just fill a form in, pay the money and the next day they're an agent,\" one agent tells me, speaking anonymously.\n\"I went for a few players and they said they weren't going to sign for me, but wanted to sign with their uncle's friend, next-door neighbour or dad's mate.\"\nBetween 2015 and 2023, when the industry was deregulated by Fifa, anyone in England without a criminal record could pay \u00a3500 plus VAT to the Football Association, sign a form and become an agent, even with zero industry experience.\nMany view the previous lack of control as having flooded the market with unqualified people. Even Fifa recognises it was a mistake. \nThe exam was reintroduced last year - having been in place between 2001 and 2015 through member associations - when the sport's governing body made it mandatory for all agents to be licensed by 1 October 2023.\nAlmost half of the 3,800 people who sat the exam in April 2023 failed.\nThe new Fifa licence is designed to boost standards and \"raise the professional and ethical standards of the profession\".\nFrom October last year, unlicensed agents were not allowed to work on transfers, contract negotiations or speak to players - although there are about 900 'legacy' agents registered before 2015 who do not have to take the exam.\nAgent Dean Eldredge with the late Sven-Goran Eriksson, one of his former clients\n\"There is that perception, maybe from the outside and unfounded in many cases, that anyone can be an agent,\" says Dean Eldredge, who runs Oporto Sports. \nEldredge deals exclusively with managers and coaches, working with Sven-Goran Eriksson before his death in August, and passed the first exam in April 2023.\nOporto has 15 coaches and managers on its books including former Leicester and Bristol City boss Nigel Pearson, Barnsley's Darrell Clarke, Rotherham's Steve Evans and ex-Lincoln and Blackburn chief Michael Appleton.\n\"It's an easy narrative to say 'oh, there's a lot of money being lost to the game because it's going to agents',\" Eldredge says.\n\"Well, if the agents are good and the agency is well run then they're essential to support that individual.\n\"While the exam is a positive step for the industry, it was far less relevant for me.\n\"I might be one of very few who specialise in working with managers so that could be something they could look at.\" \nThe exam may not correct everything but it is the first step in having the minimum knowledge about the international transfer system, how it works, how a player can be registered with clubs or how to represent minors.\nThe exam is broadly welcomed, despite some criticism of the questions. It is estimated to have cut the amount of agents by over half.\nFifa accepts the questions bear little relation to an agent's daily responsibility - and they are not supposed to. Fifa regulates the international transfer system and not the day-to-day care of players, so the exam focuses on knowledge of the market, not the human being.\n\"If it limits the number of bad agents in the game then it's good. It shouldn't be a given you could just go in and work in football,\" says former Walsall and Doncaster defender Jimmy O'Connor, who has joined Wasserman.\nIt is one of the biggest agencies in the world, with clients including Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca, Manchester City and England defender John Stones, Liverpool's Curtis Jones and Newcastle's Harvey Barnes.\nO'Connor is sitting the exam on his 40th birthday, after a 15-year playing career which started as a trainee at Aston Villa and finished at Kidderminster.\nFormer Bristol City and Norwich striker Aaron Wilbraham - who passed his exam last year - is at Murdock Sports Group, headed by former Preston and Northern Ireland defender Colin Murdock.\n\"I had bad experiences,\" said Wilbraham, who played for 10 clubs and retired aged 40 in 2020.\n\"I remember my first agent saying 'it doesn't matter who your agent is, if you do it on the pitch you'll get your moves'. That's not the case.\n\"Everything else off the pitch needs to be taken care of so you can concentrate on the football.\n\"If you are doing well you need someone in the background bringing attention to it, spinning plates and getting interest.\n\"The player has someone to call when something's gone wrong and may not want to ring his dad, who may be a builder and doesn't know what to do next.\n\"They have someone who knows football.\"\nBurnley forward Jay Rodriguez's father Kiko was trying to pass his exam at the second attempt\nBack to the day of the exam, and at breakfast in the Wembley hotel, Kiko Rodriguez - father of Burnley striker Jay - is also a bag of nerves. He works for Stoke-based Beswicks Sports and had been revising hard the night before.\nHe confesses he finds the process more stressful than watching Jay earn an England cap at Wembley against Chile in 2013.\nWhile Brownhill - who has clearly put the work in - tests me with some last-minute questions, another candidate sits down: the former Blackpool, Burnley, Preston and Oldham winger David Eyres, who has been working for Stellar agency for 17 years.\nIn the exam room, I speak to Brad Abrahams, 50, who until this point has been a senior manager in the construction industry. \nOriginally from Sydney, he has lived in the UK on and off for the past 24 years and is now based in Stevenage having worked in Asia, India and the Middle East.\nWhy the change in direction?\nHis motivation is his son Oliver, 15, who is part of Benfica's academy in London.\n\"Three years ago, my lad said 'when I make it I don't want to give my money to anyone else, I want you to represent me, dad',\" said Abrahams, who is also a goalkeeping coach for non-league side Newport Pagnell.\n\"It was very typical of my son, he's got a mature head. We've kept him out of the academy system so far and he reminds me on a weekly basis I have to become an agent.\"\nFrom the exam hall, it is clearly a male-dominated industry.\nLess than 10% of today's candidates are women and only 7% of registered agents worldwide are female.\nAutumn Brown, 24, works for PR company Outreach Talent Group (OTG), which represents clients in fashion, comedy, entertainment and sport and has recently signed England rugby winger Jess Breach.\nOTG plans to branch out into women's football and Brown - who played hockey for England age-group teams - is going in with her eyes open.\n\"It's definitely intimidating walking into an exam room when less than 10% is female,\" she says.\n\"As we've been growing we've had a number of calls with different sports agencies. I've only spoken to men on these sports calls. They immediately assume I'm not familiar with certain athletes or the industry.\n\"I do understand my value and I'm not someone that is tentative in those situations - so I'm not going to be intimidated.\"\nThe Fifa agent exam lasts 60 minutes and has 20 multiple choice questions\nAs the exam looms you can sense anxiety levels rising in the room. \nA stern notice from the chief invigilator outlines the rules and warns of Fifa disqualifying candidates.\nThe exam is random. No-one has the same questions, partly to stop anyone briefing those who are going to take it later in the day or in different time zones.\nThere were 20 cases of cheating across the world in November - including several in Spain, where candidates changed the IP address of the venue's wi-fi, allowing remote access, before changing it back and submitting their answers.\nThe exam is all on one page and exactly the same format as the mocks. I took about 30 practice tests on Fifa's agent platform but found it repetitive.\nOne candidate I spoke to took 144 mock exams but failed by a point. The point of the mocks is to ensure your device is compatible and simulate the exam experience, rather than as a full-blown study aid.\nI chose to pay \u00a3120 for extra, broader questions from a website claiming a 97% pass rate for first-time takers.\nThe exam itself is 'open', so you are allowed to use the 686-page Fifa document - the study materials - in both hard copy and as a PDF.\nI was advised to print it off so arrived with the sections - including the disciplinary code, Fifa statutes and agent regulations - stapled together but struggled to fit them all on the small desk, eventually putting half on the floor.\nDuring my revision, the criticism from most agents about the narrowness of the questions felt valid. For example, one mock exam asked about a document foreword written by Fifa president Gianni Infantino.\nWhen it was real, I had two questions around where agents can operate, one on sell-on clauses, another on parental consent, more on safeguarding and a tough one on worldwide sanctions I later find out I got wrong.\nI finished my 20 questions in 30 minutes - leaving another half-hour to check, second-guess, review and submit.\nThe relief is palpable. A stressful hour is over and everyone filters out.\nAfterwards Abrahams offers his assessment: \"It comes across as a lot of legalese. It was challenging to get engaged with the content.\n\"It makes it more difficult to pass the exam and sums up why the pass rate is so low.\"\nThis was O'Connor's first exam since his GCSEs in 2001.\n\"A lot of it is there to possibly trip you up but if it was easy it wouldn't be doing its job,\" he says. \n\"It's as nerve-wracking as any games I've played in. The relief is the same as when you've come off at an away game and nicked a 1-0 win.\"\nDespite the criticisms, the morning went smoothly. Far better than the September 2023 exams at the NEC in Birmingham and ExCel centre in London where the wi-fi failed and caused chaos.\n\"It was the most stressful time of my life,\" one agent who attended and passed the ExCel exam tells BBC Sport.\n\"It was a shambles. If you failed then any player who was signed to you could leave, you weren't adhering to the new rules so the agreement was invalid. \n\"I could have lost my client base [of about 25 players] in one swoop.\"\nThis video can not be played\nThe Football News Show: Why Nathan Lowe's dad became a football agent\nThe 2015 deregulation opened the doors to more family members becoming intermediaries and there were plenty at Wembley looking to pass.\nAndy Lowe, father of Stoke striker Nathan, was sitting the afternoon exam.\nHe does not have the desire to represent his son directly himself but says a licence would give him the knowledge, and he plans on advising other parents on their agent choices.\nNathan, on loan at Walsall, is a client of Murdock Sports Group, which counts Napoli's Scott McTominay and Manchester United's Jonny Evans as two of its highest-profile players.\n\"A trusted adviser is the best description I could have of a good agent,\" says Andy.\n\"Someone who is aligned with your child's goals and aspirations and is bringing a unique set of skills to the table which help support them. But that can't be the parent. If you are the parent and the agent it could cause difficulties and challenges.\n\"I'm doing it because I want to understand and to keep my agents on their toes. I need them to know I know what this is about. All I care about is my child.\n\"I had to do a lot of research to figure out what made a good agent and why. I'd like that to be more accessible to parents like myself.\"\nOne agent, speaking anonymously as part of this piece, was asked whether family members could make good agents and said \"some are really unreasonable\" which can \"hurt boys' careers\".\n\"Clubs don't want to deal with parents because they are too emotionally involved,\" they added.\nHowever, a sporting director at a top-level club - whose job is dealing with transfers and therefore agents - dismissed suggestions family members cause problems.\nHe described his negotiations with them as \"no more complicated\" than those with a traditional agency around transfers or new contracts.\nA manager, who played in the Premier League during a 20-year career, accepts agents are necessary, even if they can become problematic whoever they are.\nHe said: \"The longer you are in it, you trust certain ones more than others. Sometimes when there's a disingenuous bit of information, that trust can go.\n\"It works both ways. If I'm trying to sign a player and a club doesn't want to lose that player, the agent provides the buffer to discuss what the likelihood of a deal may be.\n\"There will be times that relationship can become frayed and you know if you remove the middle man things will be easier. \n\"But from a player's perspective it's worthwhile having that separation from the finances and negotiations.\"\nAn email from Fifa dropped a week later. It read \"congratulations\" and asked for more money to complete the application process. \nIf you pass, you are not told what mark you got. Only those who fail are informed of which questions they got wrong.\nA text from Brownhill arrives. \"I passed my exam\" and a flame emoji. \nBirthday boy O'Connor has passed too. I am later told the two exams this year had a pass rate of just 40%.\nWhat now then? While I have a Fifa licence and am officially an agent, it does not necessarily make me one.\nIt is like passing your driving test. You are legally allowed to drive a car but do you know the roads? What do you do on the motorway, how do you navigate other road users or obstacles?\nIt is the same in agency. What do I know about negotiating contracts, handling transfer requests for unhappy players or doing multi-million pound deals?\nYet, now I have passed, the licence is indefinite as long as I comply with regulations, make sure my admin is up to date - including continued professional development courses like anti-trafficking and Fifa agent regulations - and keep paying almost \u00a3500 a year to operate worldwide.\nIn the stands and in the bars, pre and post-match, the profession may be misunderstood. Agents are easy targets and there are good and bad operators in every industry.\nIt is not just a case of pass the exam, find a player and make millions. Some - perhaps even a few of those who were in the room at Wembley with me - will still undoubtedly think that.\nThe exam was the easy part.",

The country's 11-year civil war that ended in 2002 killed more than 50,000 people and displaced 2.6 million more. The rebels captured Bassie when he was just 11 years old. He was held captive for six years, managing to escape \u2013 and get caught again \u2013 three times.\u00a0\nToday, Bassie works as a tour guide for Tourism Is Life, one of many Sierra Leonean travel companies eager to show the world that the nation is now safe and introduce visitors to its many rainforests, beaches and rich cultural experiences.\nThough the war ended more than two decades ago, its legacy \u2013 compounded by a 2014 Ebola virus outbreak \u2013 has meant that Sierra Leone remains something of an off-the-beaten-path destination, attracting only a small fraction of the visitors who venture to nearby Ghana or Senegal, for example.\nIn its pre-war tourism heyday of the 1980s, visitors were drawn to Sierra Leone's beachfront locations like Bureh, another white-sand haven an hour's drive south from its energetic capital, Freetown. But beyond its famous western coastline, this Scotland-sized nation boasts a stunningly diverse array of landscapes. In the south-east, the Gola rainforest and Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary are home to chimpanzees, rare Diana monkeys, Bongo antelopes and more than 320 bird species. In the north, the Outamba-Kilimi National Park is a woodland savannah and sanctuary for hippos, elephants and colobus monkeys. And in the east, plateaus lead up to Mount Bintumani, one of West Africa's highest peaks.\nDubbed \"the forgotten industry\" by some residents, tourism is now becoming a focus for Sierra Leone once again. A multi-year World Bank development project is underway, training tourism staff, building infrastructure and developing ecotourism sites in areas like south-eastern Sierra Leone, where the elusive \u2013 and endangered \u2013 pygmy hippo lives.\nNow, a new generation of Sierra Leoneans wants visitors to reconsider what their country is all about.\u00a0\n\"Growing up, I would hop around Tokeh Beach and Maroun Island, drink coconuts, get a lobster, and cook it for lunch,\" said Wissam Stanger Sfeile, a freediving coach who competed for Sierra Leone in the freediving world championships. In 2016, he co-founded Bafa, an eco-resort on the northern tip of Banana Islands, a lush trio of islands south of Freetown.\nAt Bafa, hammocks swayed in the breeze and glamping tents were spread throughout the shore as fresh lobster sizzled on the grill. Together with his wife Emily, Sfeile wanted to recreate the experience he had as a child. The eco-resort leases the land from the nearby fishing community of Dublin. Sfeile buys fish and produce from Dublin and employs youth from the community. \"I wanted others to experience our nature in a space where guests could enjoy the beauty of trees, flowers and beaches,\" he explained.\nBeyond their natural appeal, the country's islands were the setting of one of history's most tragic events: at the peak of the transatlantic slave trade in the 17th and 18th Centuries, they became one of the main departure points to the New World for enslaved West Africans.\nAccording to the Slave Voyages digital initiative, roughly 400,000 people were sent through the British trade ports in Sierra Leone from 1501 to 1866. Of them, Bunce Island, was the most prolific. It's situated halfway between Senegal and Liberia, the area then known as the Rice Coast. From here, British slave traders sold people with a particular knowledge \u2013 how to grow rice \u2013 to plantation owners in South Carolina and Georgia. An estimated 30,000 people walked through the\u00a0\"door of no return\" on this\u00a0quiet island with a now-crumbling fort, exiled by colonial enslavers to the rice-growing colonies in the West Indies and North America.\nThe Banana Islands once served as the substation for Bunce, and that history is still visible today. The community of Dublin traces its roots to descendants of emancipated Africans who started returning to Sierra Leone after the abolition of slave trade by Britain in 1807. Rusted cannons and a mass grave near the Bafa resort hold the memory of those who tried to resist their fate.\nFreetown, the country's capital and largest city, is rooted in resistance, too. The crowded port city at the foot of the verdant Peninsula Mountains was founded in the late-18th Century by formerly enslaved people from England, North America, the Caribbean and beyond. Their descendants became known as the Krios, an ethnic group whose language, Krio, is still the lingua franca in Sierra Leone today.\nOn a cosy rooftop with string lights south of Freetown, London-raised chef Susan Senesie serves meals she grew up with, such as extra spicy goat pepper soup or tamarind pie. Her Treat Food restaurant in Funkia, a neighbourhood with a large fish market, creates fine-dining versions of local dishes.\n\"When I used to visit [family in] Sierra Leone over holidays, I had difficulty dining out, because there was no authentic local restaurant here,\" she told me. \"It was disheartening.\" Though at first people questioned her decision to put cassava leaves on a canape when cassava is traditionally served with a mountain of rice, the concept took off. Today, Senesie offers cooking classes, and her restaurant trains and hires people who were disabled during the war.\nArtist Hawa Bangura is another repatriate who returned hoping to help the nation recover. Her paintings tell stories of African women while tackling themes of identity, heritage and cultural reclamation. \"The slower pace of life in Sierra Leone gave me time to explore the ideas and narratives of African history, which was never taught in the schools I attended in the West,\" she explained.\nBangura practiced law in New York before returning home in 2007. In Freetown, she founded The Barray, a collective of artists promoting Sierra Leone's contemporary visual art scene. \"The civil war devastated the creative sector,\" said Bangura. \"But we are resilient people. Our creative community, including art, music, fashion, film and theatre, is beginning to heat up.\"\nThat excitement was evident at MaryAnn Kaikai's regular salon in western Freetown, where a dozen women gathered one evening under the shade of mango trees. Kaikai is the creative force behind Madam Wokie, a Sierra Leonean fashion label showcased in New York, Johannesburg and other international cities. Kaikai echoed Bangura's feelings, saying that with everything Sierra Leoneans have been through \u2013 losing limbs in the war or suffering through Ebola \u2013 they are not bitter. \"We have this fighting spirit where we say Tel God Tenki, [\"I tell God thank you\" in Krio], and we move on,\" she explained.\u00a0\nKaikai designs vibrant clothes and accessories for her community and beyond; actors Eva Mendes and Idris Elba, an honourary Sierra Leonean, are among the brand's customers. Partnering with the World Bank and the Ministry of Tourism, Kaikai recently trained local women to become future tourism entrepreneurs and artisans, equipping them with skills like gara tie-dyeing, a traditional plant-based craft. The designer is optimistic about the future: \"Despite everything, there's always that feeling of hope.\"\nHeading north-west out of Freetown, I watched busy markets and the rush of tuk-tuks disappear from view. A dense forested landscape took over. Wild mango and cashew trees rose over red soil. Villages gave way to colossal palms and micro-farms. This is the Northern Province, the nation's sparsely populated farmland and cattle-rearing region.\nThe striking Wara Wara mountains overshadowed the landscape in the town of Kabala, situated in the remote Koinadugu district. As we hiked to the top of a nearby hill, passing local kids selling cashew nuts by the road, Bassie told me that historical resistance to slavery flourished here, thanks to the many caves and rocky outcrops where people could hide.\nFew written records exist, but one points to the natural rock fortress of Old Yagala just outside of town where hundreds of people are said to have joined forces to resist enslavement. After the slave trade was over, the British Empire turned Sierra Leone into a Crown Colony. Shortly after, a local man named Bai Bureh led another rebellion against British forces.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Teraanga: The word that defines Senegal\n\u2022 Nigeria: The country that loves to overachieve\n\u2022 The most inviting city in Africa?\u00a0\nRetelling stories like these is at the heart of what Bimbola Carrol does. Twenty years ago he founded VSL Travel after seeing mostly negative coverage of his country. \"I felt that if we were looking to get back on our feet, we needed to show people another side of Sierra Leone,\" he told me.\nToday, Carrol organises a range of trips: to the small village of Rogbonko in the Northern Province where travellers can stay in thatched-roof huts with the local community, or to the Western Peninsula near Freetown to spot the white-necked rockfowl, one of Africa's rarest and most peculiar birds. \"Everyone who comes to Sierra Leone falls in love with our nation,\" said Carrol. \"We are lagging behind other countries, but the world is starting to take note. For me, that is cause to be optimistic about the future.\"\nIndeed, there are signs of change. In 2023, a new solar-powered airport opened near Freetown. A new visa-on-arrival programme starting in 2019 has made it easier for travellers to plan trips. And the nation's newly established flag carrier, Air Sierra Leone, announced plans to start direct flights from Gatwick to Freetown in the near future.\nBack in Freetown, Bassie dreams of opening his own tourism school one day. \"Tourism brings everyone closer,\" he told me. The hope here is to bring more travellers closer to Sierra Leone in the years to come.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From a 17th-Century Italian violin stolen from Japan to Drake's lost Blackberry in Mexico, here are musical lost and found mysteries that rival Sir Paul McCartney's.\nIn musical happy endings, last week, Sir Paul McCartney was reunited with his bass guitar\u00a0that was stolen 51 years ago in London.\u00a0The instrument, which McCartney purchased in 1961, was subsequently nabbed from a band van\u00a0in 1972. Now, thanks to the Lost Bass search project, the Beatle has been reunited with the bass, which had been until recently stashed in a Sussex attic. Both McCartney and H\u00f6fner, the instrument manufacturer, authenticated the found item upon its rediscovery, and a spokesperson for McCartney told BBC News he was \"incredibly grateful\" for the return of his lost guitar.\u00a0\nMore like this:\nSquid Game season 2: Everything we know so far\nThis is Me\u2026 Now: A Love Story: Why J-Lo deserves respect for her 'bonkers' new musical movie\nThe strange journey behind the TikTok duo replacing Lin Manuel Miranda for the Moana sequel\nBut McCartney certainly isn't the only musician to lose a valuable piece of his kit \u2013 in fact, he's not even the only Beatle. And for non-Beatles-level musical acts, the loss of an instrument \u2013 or worse, an entire kit \u2013 can be devastating. The BBC previously reported on the theft of rock band Cemetery Sun's entire kit and van, as well as trio Noisy's stolen kit reappearing\u00a0with individual instruments and pieces of gear up for auction online weeks later.\nBassist Grant Emerson of Americana band Delta Rae recalls having around $10,000 (\u00a37,937) of musical instruments stolen: \"We played at the Bitter End in New York City and parked our van down the street. When we came back to the van, the back door had been broken into, and all of our guitars were gone, plus a pedal board and a piece of the drummer's equipment. Probably four to five pieces of gear were stolen. It was a really terrible drive back to North Carolina.\" He notes that for most bands, the only recourse is fundraising: \"You just rely on your fans. You ask for help and donations, which isn't easy.\" And he urges all musicians to \"photograph the serial number of every instrument and piece of gear you own\".\nLost or stolen instruments over the years have kept musicians and fans alike searching for guitars, violins, and even an entire brass band. Here are a few more musical mysteries \u2013 some of which remain unsolved to this day.\u00a0\nThe famous blues legend was known for riffs on his legendary guitar, a Gibson he named Lucille \u2013 in fact, King had multiple performance guitars named Lucille over the course of his career. The name was inspired by a lover\u2019s quarrel King witnessed in 1949 (the woman arguing was named Lucille, and she left quite an impression on King). When this particular Lucille guitar was stolen, it was eventually found in a Las Vegas pawn shop by Eric Dahl, a fellow musician who mistakenly purchased the guitar and later returned it to King. Dahl offered it without compensation and went on to write a book about King and his many guitars. The Gibson also ended up being one of the last instruments King played before his death in 2015, and it was subsequently sold at his estate auction for $280,000 (\u00a3222,286) in 2019.\u00a0\nClapton's Gibson Les Paul guitar, named Beano, was stolen soon after his studio album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was released in 1966. Unlike King, Clapton hasn't been so lucky as to be reunited with his lost guitar \u2013 yet. But singer-songwriter Joe Bonamassa has claimed he knows where it is:\u00a0In 2016, Bonamassa gave an interview in which he said the guitar was in a private US collection, which spurred a 2018\u00a0petition\u00a0to encourage Bonamassa to reveal more details. On their YouTube channel, music aficionados Baxter and Jonathan of North Carolina-based Casino Guitars joked that they imagine a \"guitar illuminati\" trading in lost and rare instruments might not be pleased with what Bonamassa has already shared so far \u2013 and pondered whether he has a responsibility to help Clapton retrieve the stolen item if he does, in fact, know where it is.\u00a0\nA violin made in 1675 by Nicolo Amati in Italy was stolen in 2005 from the home of Japanese violinist Takiko Omura, who had purchased the instrument in the United States many decades earlier. The violin, which\u00a0was priced at nearly \u00a3300,000 ($377,895)\u00a0in 2005 when it was taken, was reportedly found in 2020 in Parma, Italy, in the raid of a home of a suspected drug trafficker. Authorities in Italy and Japan worked together to return the instrument to its rightful owner.\u00a0\nIt's difficult enough to find one lost guitar, let alone an entire brass band. In 2022, a famous local New Orleans \"second line\" brass band had all their equipment stolen from their van\u00a0during the worst possible time for them \u2013 two weeks before New Orleans Jazz Fest. Nearly $12,000 (\u00a39,526) in musical instruments, including cymbals, drum sets, keyboards and amps, were stolen when the band's van disappeared from outside the home of a band member. The theft threatened to derail the Stooges' festival appearance that year, but the band is back on its feet, with a scheduled appearance on 28 April at this year's Jazz Fest.\nAs the BBC has previously reported, the violin prodigy Min Kym's Stradivarius was stolen in 2010 from a Pret a Manger restaurant. This was no ordinary violinist and no ordinary violin: At just seven years old, Kym had earned a slot at the prestigious Purcell School of Music in the UK, and at age 11, she won first prize at the Premier Mozart International Competition. When presented with the opportunity to own a rare 1696 Stradivarius, \"Kym remortgaged her flat and bought the violin for \u00a3450,000 ($580,000). If this seems like an astronomical amount of money, it was in fact a steal in Stradivarius terms: the violin's actual worth was closer to \u00a31.2m ($1.5m) and these instruments are so precious that their value only ever goes up,\u201d reads the 2017 article about the crime. Although the stolen violin was eventually recovered three years later, it was not returned to Kym, and her\u00a0memoir, Gone: A Girl, A Violin, A Life Unstrung, tells the story of coping with a musical instrument being lost and found and then lost again.\nSir Paul wasn't even the only Beatle whose beloved instrument was absconded with: George Harrison's 1965 Rickenbacker guitar was allegedly stolen in 1966. Rickenbacker CEO John Hall told Reverb that the guitar's mystery has been so longstanding because \"no one knows the exact serial number of the original guitar.\" The Rickenbacker team were, however, able to narrow the list down to five potential guitars based on shipment dates.\u00a0\nHarrison also had his '57 Les Paul, Lucy \u2013 which was formerly owned by the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian, Rick Derringer, and Eric Clapton \u2013 stolen. It was nabbed from Harrison's home during a burglary in 1973 and then sold to a Los Angeles music store who, in turn, sold it to Mexican musician Miguel Ochoa, who declined to sell it back to Harrison at full price. Instead, Ochoa negotiated a trade with Harrison: Harrison got Lucy back, and Ochoa would get a 1958 Les Paul Standard and a Fender Precision bass.\u00a0\nIn his 2009 song Say What's Real, produced by Kanye West, Drake revealed that he lost some of his best lyrics in Mexico: \"Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo/So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll,\" he raps, followed by an expletive-laden line that finishes the rhyme. For his genre of music, that Blackberry was his instrument, which he\u00a0used to pen his songs. While it doesn't sound like it's ever been returned, Drake has probably upgraded his tech.\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis year's tournament marks 25 years since the beginning of the Six Nations era.\nOver the past quarter of a century, the championship has played host to some true greats of the game and, in current France captain Antoine Dupont, has a player seemingly taking the game to another level.\nBBC Sport takes a look at each nation's standout stars since 2000 and the impact they have had on this competition, before giving you the chance to make your selection of who you think is the greatest player in Six Nations history.\nStatistics provided by Opta and correct on 6 February, 2025\nSuch has been Antoine Dupont's impact since making his France debut in 2017, numbers alone do not get close to doing him justice.\nThe frame of a bull, the acceleration of a wing and technical skills from the gods - Dupont's skillset is otherworldly. A scrum-half who matches 20 try assists in the Six Nations with 20 turnovers simply is not normal.\nIt is not just in the XV-a-side game that Dupont has excelled. The prospect of representing his country at a home Olympics last year meant he missed the 2024 Six Nations to focus on sevens, and Dupont scored two tries as France beat favourites Fiji to win the gold medal at the Paris Games.\n\"The boys joke around and call him 'The Martian' as he is not from earth, he is an alien,\" said Toulouse lock Emmanuel Meafou before last year's Champions Cup final. \"The stuff he does in games is only half of what he is capable of.\"\nAnd yet that half is better than virtually anyone else. In France's 43-0 win against Wales on Friday, the 28-year-old's shift lasted barely 50 minutes and yet he became the first player to provide three try assists in two separate men's Six Nations matches.\nThe cross-field kick for Theo Attissogbe's opening score was so casual, it was almost offensive.\nDupont next visits Twickenham's Allianz Stadium, where he masterminded a record rout of seven tries in 2023. The England camp have been keen to stress this week that the 2022 Grand Slam-winning captain is only human, but his reputation is becoming anything but.\nJonny Wilkinson will always be synonymous with drop-kicking England to World Cup glory in Sydney in 2003 but his record in the Six Nations is equally impressive.\nIn 2001, when he won back-to-back titles with England, Wilkinson set overall records for points (89) and conversions (24) that are yet to be surpassed in a single edition of this tournament.\nWilkinson's peerless game management and place-kicking were underpinned by the fiercest of work ethics and desire to put his body on the line, a combativeness that helped the fly-half face down depression and panic attacks during his career.\nEngland's Six Nations win-rate with Wilkinson in the team was 74%, while he made 172 of 211 kicks at goal and ranked fifth of any player for try assists (17).\n\"Jonny instilled confidence in those who played with him and took confidence away from those he played against,\" said former Six Nations team-mate Richard Hill. \"There were many matches we would have lost without him.\"\nThe influence of the most-capped player in history has perhaps been most keenly felt since his retirement.\nSince Alun Wyn Jones officially called time on an 18-year international career in 2023, Wales have won just five of 20 Tests, losing all six in the Six Nations.\nHe made his Six Nations debut in 2007, while his last appearance came against France two years ago.

Who rivals Dupont as Six Nations' greatest player?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Is Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?Matt HobbsBBC Sport journalistPublished6 February 2025667 CommentsThis year's tournament marks 25 years since the beginning of the Six Nations era.Over the past quarter of a century, the championship has played host to some true greats of the game and, in current France captain Antoine Dupont, has a player seemingly taking the game to another level.BBC Sport takes a look at each nation's standout stars since 2000 and the impact they have had on this competition, before giving you the chance to make your selection of who you think is the greatest player in Six Nations history.Statistics provided by Opta and correct on 6 February, 2025Such has been Antoine Dupont's impact since making his France debut in 2017, numbers alone do not get close to doing him justice.The frame of a bull, the acceleration of a wing and technical skills from the gods - Dupont's skillset is otherworldly. A scrum-half who matches 20 try assists in the Six Nations with 20 turnovers simply is not normal.It is not just in the XV-a-side game that Dupont has excelled. \"Watching Brian O'Driscoll dart through defences almost at will was a joyous experience - unless you were among those tasked with trying to stop him.Elusive and formidable, O'Driscoll played with an ease which belied the sheer seriousness of his numbers; 163 defenders beaten, 82 offloads, 53 turnovers, 45 wins and 26 tries - all of which stand as Six Nations records despite his retirement more than a decade ago.The centre's final Six Nations campaign in 2014 provided a fairytale ending; a knee-knocking triumph in Paris that saw O'Driscoll win his second championship on his 133rd, and last, cap for Ireland.It came 14 years after the 2009 Grand Slam winner burst onto the Six Nations scene by scoring one of the tournament's most iconic hat-tricks against France in the same stadium.Sometimes moments matter more than statistics.When Scotland prepared to face England at Murrayfield in 2018, they had not beaten their oldest rivals in a decade.",

        "article_text": "Jack Dempsey and Scotland suffered a bruising 32-18 defeat by Ireland\nAs they strive to find new ways to raise revenues at Murrayfield, Scottish Rugby could do worse than having a giant Peter O'Mahony pinata hanging from the lower reaches of the east stand.\nThey'd be queuing round the block to give Scotland's great bogey man some stick. A fortune could be made.\nOn Sunday, O'Mahony wasn't as influential or as objectionable, to Scottish eyes, as he normally is, but the mere fact that the veteran forward was there had a psychological relevance.\nThis was another day when Ireland lived rent free in Scottish heads - and then proceeded to wreck the joint.\nGregor Townsend has taken Scotland a long way, but the head coach is running to stand still against Ireland. Eleven games, 11 defeats, too many of them decided too early, as was the case again on Sunday.\nWhat do Irish think of latest Scotland collapse?\nWatch: Dominant Ireland beat disappointing Scotland\nTalking points from Six Nations round two\nIt was the roaring predictability of it all that hit Scotland the hardest. Nothing about this latest defeat was surprising.\nIt took Ireland eight minutes to score at Murrayfield, the nerveless Sam Prendergast enjoying time and space and a penalty advantage to throw a long left-to-right pass to Calvin Nash, all on his lonesome.\nIn Scotland's grim history in this contest, it was an entirely familiar occurrence, one you could have set your watch by. Dan Sheehan, James Lowe, Robbie Henshaw, Johnny Sexton, James Ryan and Conor Murray have all scored early against Scotland in recent years.\nLowe took two minutes to strike at the World Cup in Paris in 2019. Ryan took seven minutes four years earlier in Yokohama. Henshaw took eight minutes at Murrayfield in 2021. \nNone of those scores came later than the 13th minute and all of them, of course, set Ireland on their way to victory.\nSo, when Nash touched down in the corner on Sunday, those with a half-decent memory and a fatalistic bent started to lose all hope for Townsend's team. Injuries to Finn Russell and Darcy Graham added to the darkness of the day.\nThis was more of the same. Not quite as awful as Yokohama or Paris, but close enough. \nTo be 17-0 down after 31 minutes at home was mortifying, but the reality was that it could and should have been more. Ireland were denied a pretty clear penalty try and were held up over the Scotland line twice. \nThey didn't just quieten the home crowd, they stunned them into silence.\nThis video can not be played\n'Total domination' from Ireland - O'Gara\nIreland went direct with menace. Not many airs, not many graces. No need. Just venomous carries from their big units and gainline, gainline, gainline.\nThe physical power of this Ireland team is matched by the intelligence and game awareness of its leaders. They are a coherent and efficient force, brilliantly organised. Attritional and relentless. \nFor 11 games in a row now, Scotland have been salmon leaping and Ireland have been the grizzlies waiting at falls-edge to gobble them up.\nTownsend's team worship at the altar of width. They rely on fast ball and Hollywood moments from their wonderful attackers to break down defences, but that rarely happens against Ireland. \nThere is no other way for them under Townsend. It's Hollywood or bust.\nIreland get ahead and they stay ahead. That's what they do. \nMore than any other team that Scotland play, they have a capacity to shut the Scots down, to render their dangermen largely irrelevant amid the suffocating intensity of their game.\nConsider this: under Townsend, Scotland have scored an average of 13 points in their games against South Africa with an average of 18 against Wales, 20 against France and New Zealand, 23 against England and 27 against Australia. \nAgainst Ireland, the average is 12 as opposed to Ireland's 26. The gap on Sunday was 14, which is bang on the 11-game norm.\nScotland visit England next in the Six Nations\nTownsend will get heat for this latest loss, not just because they were beaten - most people predicted an away win - but because they were beaten playing the same brand of rugby that always sees them beaten by Ireland.\nOn Townsend's watch, Scotland have won five out of seven against England, with one draw. They've beaten France five times and have beaten Wales twice in a row - with historic away victories against both.\nThey are four wins from five against the Wallabies and, in two Tests against the All Blacks, they were there until the end, losing one by five and the other by eight. But Ireland? It's a recurring nightmare.\nThere was a list of things that Scotland had to do, and could not do, that was as long as the Corstorphine Road and they barely ticked a box. Stifled, again. Unable to handle Ireland's pressure, again. Error-ridden, again.\nBlair Kinghorn might play for the greatest club in the world, but he had no great protectors here as he does at Toulouse. The full-back had one of his worst days in a Scotland jersey. A talented athlete, the green shirt is his kryptonite and he is not alone in that.\nScotland needed more aggression, more belligerence, more directness, but they cannot live with Ireland in those areas. They don't have enough heavies. There is only a certain level of nasty in this team - and that's part of the problem.\nScotland can win, or at least be competitive, against most nations these days because their backs can have a devastating impact, but against the unrelenting Ireland machine, it's a different story.\nTownsend badly missed captain Sione Tuipulotu's dominant presence in the midfield and you sense that, if some of his other second rows were not injured right now, he would not have started with the two he started with.\nWhen they are back on their feet, the present, and future, in the second row are Scott Cummings and Max Williamson along with Gregor Brown and Cameron Henderson. \nScotland need more thunder, more brutes. To get to another level, they need monsters to meet the likes of Ireland on the gainline and hammer them backwards.\nThey don't have anything like the carries or the force from their locks when it is Grant Gilchrist and Jonny Gray, fine players though they are. \nYou can add Andy Onyeama-Christie into the mix of sadly absent warriors. Whether from the start or off the bench, the back row is part of the solution.\nIn Dublin last year, in a game that went to the wire with only four points between them at the end, the Saracens forward had a fantastic edge to him and made 31 tackles. So, there is a cavalry, but it's stricken right now.\nWe won't see them this Six Nations, which is painful, because it's England away next and the odds are against Scotland making it five in a row.\nEngland are not Ireland, though. So the psychology is different and the hope is real. \nScotland will not be beaten before the first whistle at Twickenham. That was the suspicion on Sunday. \nOutplayed, yes. Overpowered, undoubtedly. But you got a sense, too - and not for the first time - that it was over almost before it began.\nScottish Rugby Union",

        "article_text": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993.\nIt sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993.\nBut the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell.\nEven today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book \u2013 based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible \u2013 demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters \u2013 like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 \u2013 or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.\u00a0\nThis space mirror idea was taken up again by German physicists during World War Two. At the Nazi weapons research centre in Hillersleben, scientists worked on a design to build a terrifying reflective orbiting weapon called the Sonnengewehr or Sun gun in German. In 1945, Time magazine reported that captured German scientists had told US Army interrogators that the Sonnengewehr was meant to act as a death ray, refocusing light from the Sun to set fire to cities or boil away water in lakes. Despite facing evident scepticism from their US interrogators as they handed over their technical drawings, the German scientists had believed that their Sun gun could be operational in 50 years, the chief of Allied technical intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel John Keck, told reporters at the time.\nIn the 1970s, another German\u2010born rocket engineer, Dr Krafft Ehricke, again began looking at the concept. Ehricke had been a member of Germany's V-2 rocket team during World War Two. At the end of the war, he surrendered to the US and was recruited as part of Operation Paperclip, wherein 1,600 scientists, engineers and technicians deemed to be valuable were shielded from prosecution, spirited out of Germany, and allowed to continue their work in the US.\nEhricke became part of the US space programme, and in the 1970s he returned to the idea of building a mirror in space. In 1978, he wrote a paper detailing how giant orbiting mirrors could illuminate the night sky, enabling farmers to plant or harvest 24 hours a day, or could be used to deflect sunlight down onto solar panels on Earth to be converted into electricity on demand. He called this idea Power Soletta. Ehricke, a space-travel enthusiast from childhood and a long-time proponent of colonising other planets, died in 1984 without seeing Power Soletta come to fruition. But he would get his long-desired space flight posthumously when his cremated remains were launched into Earth's orbit in 1997 along with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s counterculture psychologist Timothy Leary.\u00a0\nThroughout the 1980s, Nasa looked repeatedly at the concept of generating solar power by harnessing sunlight with an orbiting mirror system called Solares, but despite government interest the project was never able to secure funding. However, in Russia the idea of solar mirrors took root.\u00a0\nAt the time, a Russian scientist called Vladimir Syromiatnikov was investigating whether large reflective solar sails could be attached to a spaceship. Syromiatnikov was a pioneering figure in space engineering breakthroughs. He had worked on the Vostok rocket, the world's first crewed spacecraft that took Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. He also developed an ingenious spacecraft docking mechanism, the Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS). This was used in July 1975 in the Apollo-Soyuz test project, the first joint space flight by the then Cold War enemies, the US and the USSR, in which a US module carrying three astronauts successfully linked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule carrying two cosmonauts in orbit. His APAS was later used to enable US shuttles to dock with the Russian Mir space station and is still used for docking at the International Space Station.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov thought that if solar sails were attached to a spacecraft they could use the Sun in a similar fashion to how ships' sails use the wind. If the reflective sails could be angled correctly then photons, particles of energy coming from the Sun, could bounce off their mirror-like surfaces and gently propel the craft forward through space without it having to burn any fuel.\nHowever, in Russia during the post-Soviet era, getting funding for ambitious space projects like Syromiatnikov's was difficult unless they could demonstrate a clear economic goal. So Syromiatnikov decided to repurpose his concept. He thought that reflective solar sails on a spacecraft in orbit could act as a mirror, with the craft's thrusters used to angle the sails and keep them in sync with the Sun's position. That mirror could be used to beam down light on Russia's polar regions where the days are extremely short in the winter, illuminating areas shrouded in darkness. The extra sunlight would extend the working day and increase the productivity of farmlands. He also envisioned that the bonus sunshine could reduce the cost of electrical lighting and heating for the area and add to the wellbeing of people in the region.\nThis turned out to be an idea that the government could get behind. And so, funded by the Space Regatta Consortium, a group of Russian state-owned companies and agencies, and overseen by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Syromiatnikov began work on making the Znamya space mirror a reality.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nThe first prototype built, Znamya 1, wasn't actually sent into space, but remained on Earth to be tested so that Syromiatnikov could iron out any technical problems. Znamya 2 was to be the first to go into orbit. Its mirror was made from thin sheets of aluminised Mylar, a lightweight highly reflective material which was thought to be sturdy enough to survive the hostile conditions in space. It was designed to unfurl in eight sections into a circular shape from a rotating central drum mechanism and stay in that form through centrifugal force.\u00a0\n\"During the flight the reflector is wrapped tightly around the body of the craft, and to open it the craft will have to spin round rapidly forcing it out like an umbrella,\" explained the BBC's Bellingham to TV viewers in 1992. \"The trick is that at this height the 20m-wide reflector will then be able to capture the Sun's rays which normally bypass the Earth and reflect them down onto the dark side of our planet.\"\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov's plan was to have multiple Znamya launches, each one with a larger mirror that burned up as it came back to Earth. Russian engineers would be able to study how Znamya's thin reflective sheets performed when they were activated in space, and perfect his design. This would lead to the launch of a permanent Znamya with a massive 200m-wide reflector that would stay in orbit around Earth.\nThe ultimate ambition was to have a grid of up to 36 of these giant mirrors in space with the ability to pivot, enabling them to keep the reflected light targeted on the same spot. A single reflector could be used to light up a peculiar area. \"On a clear night the space reflector could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium, bringing some light relief to the long winter nights,\" said Bellingham. Or multiple reflectors could focus light together to bring greater brightness or illuminate a bigger region. It was estimated that the combined space mirror grid would be able to reflect light 50 times brighter than the Moon and illuminate an area up to 50 miles (90km) across.\u00a0\nOn 27 October 1992, the project was ready, and the crewless spacecraft Progress M-15 launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Znamya 2 on board. After the cargo supply craft docked with the Russian space station, Mir's crew fitted the drum containing the folded reflective solar sheets into position on the Progress spacecraft. Znamya 2 was due to be trialled towards the end of the year, but its deployment was delayed while the Mir crew conducted tests for other upcoming missions. On 4 February 1993, they were finally ready to put the plan into action.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Training for the Apollo 11 Moon mission\n\u2022\u00a0Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\n\u2022\u00a0The 'alien invasion' that scared the US\nThe autonomous Progress spacecraft undocked, and once it was at a distance of some 150m from Mir, it began to rotate, unfurling the mirror like a giant fan which caught the Sun's rays and beamed them back down to Earth.\nThe reflected light had a luminosity roughly equivalent to a full moon and created a spotlight about three miles (5km) wide on Earth. At a speed of five miles per second (8km per second) the patch of light raced from southern France through Switzerland, Germany, and Poland across to western Russia. The crew on Mir were able to see a faint beam of light as it swept through Europe, and despite much of the continent being covered in clouds that day, some people on the ground reported witnessing it as a flash of light. After a few hours, the space mirror deorbited and burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere over Canada.\u00a0\nBack in Russia, the Znamya 2 experiment was hailed as a technical success \u2013 but it also demonstrated some significant challenges for the project. Znamya 2's reflected light had proved much less intense than expected and too diffused to provide practical illumination for a large area on Earth. It had also been tricky maintaining Znamya 2's stability in orbital conditions, and its spotlight's rapid journey across the Earth's surface and fleeting visibility made its real-world uses seem limited.\nBut the mission had provided encouraging results and valuable insights, so Syromiatnikov ploughed ahead with his planned follow-up experiment, Znamya 2.5. This time it would have a 25m mirror, reflecting a luminosity of between five and 10 full moons, and shining a spot of light that would cover an area five miles (8km) wide. The intention was to control the direction of the reflected light beam so it could target a spot on the Earth for several minutes at a time as Znamya 2.5 revolved around the Earth. Two cities in North America were picked to be illuminated by the mirror's sun ray during what would be a 24-hour experiment, as well as several in Europe.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov was heartened by the progress his team was making, and the launch was planned for October 1998. \"We are pioneers in the field,\" he told The Moscow Times in July 1998. \"If the experiment goes according to plan, we propose to send dozens more craft into space in the future on a permanent basis.\"\nBut even before Znamya 2.5 left the ground, Russian space officials began receiving complaints. Astronomers were worried that the mirror would pollute the night sky with light, dazzling their telescopes and obscure their view of the stars. The Royal Astronomical Society went so far as to protest to the Director General of the Space Regatta Consortium about the experiment. Ecologists also raised concerns that its artificial light might cause confusion to animals and plants, disrupting wildlife and nature cycles.\u00a0\nDespite these misgivings, there was considerable global attention and excitement about the Znamya project's potential implications. \"Think what it will mean for the future of mankind,\" Syromiatnikov told The Moscow Times. \"No more electricity bills, no more long, dark winters. This is a serious breakthrough for technology.\" And so, the Znamya 2.5's launch went ahead as planned, and with Mission Control monitoring from Moscow, the larger space mirror was primed to deploy on 5 February 1999.\nAt first everything went as planned; the folded-up space mirror had been attached to Progress, which undocked from Mir without a hitch. It smoothly moved into position away from the space station, Progress's thrusters were commanded to fire, and it began to spin to unfurl the foil mirror. Unfortunately, at the same time an extra command was sent to Progress by mistake, telling it to deploy the antenna it used to communicate for docking manoeuvres. As the antenna extended, Znamya 2.5's thin reflective sheets immediately became caught up in it.\nMission Control in Moscow watched in dismay as footage of the tangled mirror beamed back from Mir, and frantic commands were sent to retract the antenna. But by this time, several yards of foil had already become wrapped around it, tearing the mirror in several places. Realising that they were in danger of ripping the reflective sheets further, the commands were paused. A second desperate attempt to spin the mirror free was tried an hour later, but to no avail.\nCrestfallen, Mission Control recognised that the Znamya 2.5's torn and crumpled mirror could never be unfurled, and allowed it to fall to Earth still attached to the Progress craft. It burnt up in the atmosphere the following day over the Pacific Ocean. \"The mood here is very depressed,\" Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for the Mission Control in Moscow, told the BBC at the time.\u00a0\nIts fall to Earth did not just destroy Znamya 2.5 but the future of Syromiatnikov's idealistic space mirror project. His planned Znamya 3 with a 70m reflecting surface, which was meant to launch in 2001, could not secure funding and was never built. Syromiatnikov, widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding space engineers of his generation, died in 2006, his dreams of solar sails and mirrors unrealised.\u00a0\n\"The failure was especially painful because of the huge worldwide interest that the experiment aroused,\" Lyndin told the BBC in 1999. \"We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programmes \u2013 to do something first and boast about it only after.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Released 40 years ago this month, Milo\u0161 Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies \u2013 but the film's critics could be missing the point.\nWhen it premiered 40 years ago, Amadeus drew an initial wave of praise. A historical drama revolving around the rivalry between two composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it went on to win eight Oscars, including for best picture. Milo\u0161 Forman took home the best director prize, Peter Shaffer won for best adapted screenplay and both of the lead actors were nominated: F Murray Abraham, who played Salieri, beat Tom Hulce, who played Mozart.\nBut in the years that followed, a backlash grew over what some people saw as Amadeus's litany of historical errors. An article in The Guardian declared that \"the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is\", and the BBC commented that \"the film plays shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact\". Salieri, critics noted, was no pious bachelor (as attested by his wife, eight children and mistress), and it's after all an odd kind of hateful rivalry when the real Mozart entrusted the musical education of his own son to Salieri. As for Mozart's lewd humor, that cheeky insouciance was actually commonplace in middle-class Viennese society. Most egregiously of all, world-famous Mozart was not dumped in an unmarked pauper's grave. If this is a homage to history, the complaint goes, it's akin to Emperor Joseph II fumbling ineptly on the pianoforte and bungling every other note.\nBut this kind of cavilling may be missing the point. Forman's aim for Amadeus can be seen as radically different from a typical biopic, and that was to use a fictionalised version of an epic clash between musical composers to allegorise the defining global rivalry of the mid-to-late 20th Century: the Cold War. Put simply, the film may have played fast and loose with 1784 because its real preoccupation was 1984.\nThe film opens in Vienna in 1823. Grizzled court composer Salieri howls through a bolted chamber door that he has murdered Mozart, then slashes his own throat. Days later, as he convalesces in an asylum, a priest arrives to hear his confession. It doesn't disappoint. Salieri recounts that as boy he made a vow of chastity to God as an expression of gratitude for, as he sees it, ushering in the providential death of his father to clear the path for his musical development.\nJump ahead some years, and Salieri is now an eminent composer in the court of Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), where he eagerly awaits an introduction to musical prodigy Mozart. That eagerness curdles when he sees the man in the flesh \u2013 he turns out to be a lascivious vulgarian with an ear-splitting cackle. Convinced that God means to mock his own mediocrity, Salieri hurls a crucifix in the fire and vows retaliation. When Mozart's father dies, Salieri seizes on the misfortune with a dastardly stratagem: dupe Mozart into believing that his father has risen from the grave to commission him to write a requiem, then murder him and pass off the masterpiece as his own. Mozart, feverish and besotted with drink, dies, leaving Salieri addled with bitterness and destined for obscurity.\nThe premise wasn't original to Forman. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Pushkin's taut 1830 play Mozart and Salieri, Peter Shaffer wrote a highly stylised play called Amadeus, which premiered in London in 1979. Forman, sitting in on a preview, was entranced by the dramatic rivalry and convinced Shaffer to collaborate with him, not merely to adapt the play for the screen but to \"demolish the original, then totally reimagine it as a film\". Across four irascible months\u00a0cloistered\u00a0in a Connecticut farmhouse with Shaffer, Forman fundamentally rebuilt the narrative with a fresh\u00a0palette of political resonances.\nThe casting process for the coveted roles of Mozart and Salieri rivaled Gone with the Wind in scope and behind-the-scenes intrigue, all of which played out over a year and involved meetings with literally thousands of actors. Kenneth Branagh was nearly victorious in landing Mozart, then got dropped from consideration when Forman pivoted to a US cast. Mark Hamill endured grueling hours of auditions, only to be told by Forman: \"No one is believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart.\" Al Pacino lobbied hard for the part of Salieri, in competition with Mick Jagger, Burt Reynolds, Donald Sutherland and Sam Waterson. In the end, Forman eschewed splashy celebrities for Hulce and Abraham, only to have casting drama explode again when Meg Tilly, slated to play Mozart's wife, Constanze, broke her ankle playing football: she was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge a week before shooting was to commence. With the plot rebuilt and the cast in place, more than one rivalry was poised to come into focus.\nThe Czech-born Forman had been a galvanising force behind the Czechoslovakian New Wave film movement in the 1960s, reaching a climax with his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball, which satirised the absurd inefficiencies of Eastern European communism. The film was initially warmly received within the reformist milieu of the Prague Spring, but when Soviet tanks rolled into Prague the following year and organised Czechoslovakia into the Eastern bloc, Forman, tarred as a \"traitor\" to the state, was forced to flee to the West and found refuge in the US.\nNearly all of Forman's film work thereafter would show glimmers of opposition to Soviet-style censorship, confinement, and concentrated power. His first success in the US, for example, 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, depicted a mental health ward meting out cruelty and coercion to patients under the guise of benevolent care. Audiences barely needed to squint to see the asylum as gulag and Nurse Ratched as the embodiment of the drunk-on-power Soviet bureaucrat. Likewise, Forman's 1996 film, The People vs Larry Flynt, depicted the founder of Hustler magazine squaring off against censorship at the cost of being jailed, locked up at a psychiatric facility and paralysed by an assassin's bullet.\nThe Soviet allegory can certainly be applied to Amadeus. Perhaps Forman was less concerned with hewing to biographical facts as he was with presenting Mozart as a beleaguered type of ecstatic genius who, hostage to patronage, is stifled and finally crushed by the repressive apparatus of the state. Joseph II, absolute ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, is advised at court by a clutch of prudish sycophants who undermine Mozart's achievements and smear his reputation. Whatever its loose correspondence to the late-18th and early-19th Centuries, this critique can be read as a stab at the USSR \u2013 a debilitatingly centralised bureaucracy hostile to insurgent ideas and innovation. But Forman showed that Mozart would get the last laugh. By the events of 1823, Salieri's insipid, state-sponsored melodies have all been forgotten, while a few bars of Mozart draw immediate joy to the priest's face. In the free market of popular tastes, Salieri's mandated drivel has been suffocated by the triumph of genius.\nIn Forman's hands, the Habsburg Empire bears the hallmarks of Soviet power. The masquerade balls, with their bewildering swirl of masked identities, conjure the confusion and paranoia that proliferated under the Soviet system. Salieri's reluctant servant-spy (Cynthia Nixon) carries out covert surveillance, a nod to the 20th Century's KGB, which had thousands of its moles burrow into the private lives of artists and dissidents. Meanwhile, Salieri's heretical burning of the crucifix and war on God call to mind the ideological struggle between a Christian worldview and secular Soviet hubris. (After Abraham's mother \u2013 a pious Italian woman \u2013 saw the cross-burning scene, she browbeat her son so relentlessly that he blurted out what he now tells the BBC was a lie: \"I told her, 'mum, that was an extra \u2013 somebody else threw it in there!'\")\nAnd then there's the mass grave into which Mozart's corpse is dumped. This depiction does not fit the facts of what is known about his death, but it makes sense if read as an indictment of Soviet practices \u2013 the effacement of individual identity and literal mass murder. Grim excavations of these pits continue to this day. Forman, whose own parents perished in Nazi concentration camps, understood the power of this imagery.\nJeff Smith, author of Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist, tells the BBC that Mozart's struggle against the status quo tapped into Forman's own frustrations with Soviet censorship. \"The emperor's fatuous judgment about Mozart's opera \u2013 'too many notes' \u2013 is just the kind of accusation that was used as a cudgel used against avant-garde artists and thinkers to imply their work isn't pleasant or edifying to Soviet ears. Mozart's enraged incredulity in that scene must have mirrored Forman's own longstanding contempt for Soviet stagnation and repression.\"\nShooting took place in 1983 over a six-month period in Prague, which had the virtue of offering basilicas, palaces and cobblestone squares virtually unchanged since the late 18th Century. Even with Soviet power waning, however, Czechoslovakia remained part of the Eastern bloc and Forman was still persona non grata, so a deal was struck: the director would refrain from meeting with political dissidents, and the regime would allow friends of Forman to visit with their repatriated prodigal son.\nForman's own recollections from the shoot centred on the travails of Soviet interference. His landlady warned his phone is bugged. Informers lurked in every room. Two unmarked cars tailed him everywhere, which seemed redundant since his own driver was also a secret agent. In his autobiography, Turnaround, Forman is just shy of explicit about the degree to which themes of Soviet repression leaked into Amadeus. \"As it had to be in the socialist Prague,\" he wrote, \"the spirit of Franz Kafka presided over our production\".\n\u00a0\nPerhaps even more telling is a story he recounts of negotiating with the general director of Czechoslovak film, Ji\u0159\u00ed Pur\u0161, who, as Forman recounted, wanted absolute assurance that the Communist Party would have nothing to fear: \"I assume that politically there is nothing in the script that they could hang their hats on?\" Forman's reply is a model of plausible deniability and acid irony: \"Look, it's about Mozart!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The cinema classic that made Clint Eastwood a star\n\u2022\u00a0The real California scandal that led to Chinatown\n\u2022\u00a0The D-day film that changed how we see war\nF Murray Abraham felt the strain of coercive scrutiny as he was traveling back and forth to the United States to shoot his role in Scarface (1983) while Amadeus was in production in Prague.\nAbraham tells the BBC, \"At the end of every shooting day I had to cross the border to get to the airport in Vienna to return to Hollywood. At the checkpoint, the Czechoslovak Police would make us sit idle at the gate, just as a way to throw their weight around, make you know who's in charge. That sense of bullying and intimidation was everywhere, and even when the Czech people responded with subversive humor, the strain was palpable. We never forgot for a minute that we were under communist surveillance.\"\nThat tension between the US crew and Soviet agents finally burst out into the open on 4 July. The production was shooting an opera scene, and the crew arranged so that when Forman yelled \"action\" a US flag unfurled and the national anthem played in lieu of Mozart's music. Some 500 Czech extras burst forth into emotional song, in effect revealing their sympathies with the West. But not all of them.\nForman recalled, \"All stood up \u2013 except 30 men and women, panic on their face, looking at each other [asking] what they should do. They were the secret police, dispersed among the extras.\"\nAs Amadeus continues to be reassessed at its 40th anniversary, the significance of the Cold War looms ever larger. Paul Frazier, author of The Cold War on Film, tells the BBC that the film brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of Soviet envy: \"Salieri is the Soviet Lada trying to be a Ford Mustang. He can't be as great as Mozart, so he resorts to undermining and manipulating him. This too was the approach of the old USSR towards the West: rather than being better than the West, the Soviets resorted to undermining and discrediting the West at every turn.\"\nHistorian Nicholas J Cull echoes that analysis. \"Think of the Jonathan Swift line: 'When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.' Whether it's the 1780s or 1980s, what you have is true genius facing off against mediocre, conniving bureaucrats. You see this same dynamic at play in a Cold War film like last summer's Oppenheimer, which in some ways is Amadeus with A-bombs. It makes sense that refugee film-makers like Forman and his creative team would be drawn to tell an allegory of communist mismanagement.\"\nNot everyone is sold on the idea that Amadeus wrestles with Soviet totalitarianism. Kevin Hagopian, a media studies professor at Penn State University, says there's a risk of allegorising everything as an unseen Soviet menace, which ends up making art a mere handmaid to politics.\n\"That ultimately becomes a depressingly narrow way to appreciate the dazzling beauty and emotional breadth of Mozart's music,\" Hagopian tells the BBC. Nevertheless, he adds, we can't ignore the political resonances.\u00a0\n\"The allegorical space that satirical Czech film-makers like Forman opened up meant that audiences began to look for, even perhaps invent, allegorical political meaning,\" he says. \"All films could be read against the grain of a regime that lacked not only humanity but any sense of irony about itself. So if Amadeus wasn't really about Soviet-style tyranny, but audiences merely thought it was, well, I have a feeling that would be just fine with Milo\u0161 Forman.\"\nFor his part, Abraham is candid about what he believes are the more contemporary political stakes of the film, as he told the BBC in June. \"Think about how many Americans now idolise Putin. These autocrats are suddenly celebrated again. It's disheartening, truly demoralising, but if Amadeus can help us see our current predicament through fresh eyes, that shows you how powerfully its message still resonates.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Israeli troops have withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor - a military zone cutting off the north of the Gaza Strip from the south.\nHundreds of Palestinians in cars and on carts laden with mattresses and other goods began returning to northern Gaza following the pull-out - often to scenes of utter destruction. \nThe Israeli withdrawal is in line with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement of 19 January under which 16 Israeli hostages and 566 Palestinian prisoners have so far been freed.\nBy the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead.\nHamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, triggering the Gaza war.\nAt least 48,189 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says.\nOn Sunday, crowds of Palestinians were seen traversing the Netzarim Corridor - mostly moving north to see what had happened to their abandoned homes.\n\"What we saw was a catastrophe, horrific destruction. The [Israeli] occupation destroyed all the homes, shops, farms, mosques, universities and the courthouse,\" Osama Abu Kamil, a resident of al-Maghraqa just north of Netzarim, told the AFP news agency.\nThe 57-year-old, who had been forced to live for more than a year in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, said he now planned to \"set up a tent for me and my family next to the rubble of our house\".\n\"We have no choice,\" he added.\nMahmoud al-Sarhi, another displaced Palestinian, told AFP that for him \"arriving at the Netzarim Corridor meant death until this morning\".\nHe said this was \"the first time I saw our destroyed house\", referring to his home in the nearby Zeitun area.\n\"The entire area is in ruins. I cannot live here,\" he added.\nAbout 700,000 residents of northern Gaza fled to southern areas at the start of the war, when the Israeli military issued mass evacuation orders before launching a ground invasion of the Palestinian territory. \nMany of those displaced were subsequently forced to move multiple times after Israeli forces pushed into southern Gaza, too.\nThey were also prevented from returning to their homes through the Netzarim Corridor, stretching from the Gaza-Israel border to the Mediterranean Sea.\nIsraeli forces partially withdrew from the west of the corridor last month and the first Palestinians - pedestrians - were allowed to walk along the coastal Rashid Street as they crossed into northern Gaza. \nThose on vehicles have to use Salah al-Din Street and undergo screening for weapons by US and Egyptian security contractors.\nThe Israel Defense Forces have not officially commented on Sunday's withdrawal from the eastern part of the corridor, which will leave it in control of Gaza's borders, but not the road that had cut it in half.  \nThe Haaretz newspaper says the Hamas-run Gaza interior ministry has been urging people to \"exercise caution and adhere to the existing movement guidelines for their safety\".\nThe troop withdrawal comes as an Israeli delegation is expected to fly to Qatar which has been moderating talks between the two sides in the Gaza war.\nThe Israeli government has previously said the delegation will initially discuss \"technical matters\" regarding the first phase of the ceasefire deal, rather than the more challenging second phase which is meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the exchange of all remaining living hostages in Gaza for more Palestinian prisoners and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. \nThat will require further direction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently became the first foreign leader to meet US President Donald Trump since his return to the White House. \nDuring the trip, in the most dramatic shift in US policy regarding Gaza in decades, Trump called for the removal of the territory's entire civilian population and the development of what he called \"The Riviera of the Middle East\".\nConvening his first cabinet meeting since returning to Israel over the weekend, Netanyahu said Trump had come up with a \"completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel\".\n\"A revolutionary, creative vision - and we are discussing it,\" he was quoted as saying in an official readout of the meeting. \"He [Trump] is very determined to carry it out. It also opens up many possibilities for us.\"\nTrump's proposal, which would be a crime under international law, has been almost universally rejected, including by Arab states. \nThe Saudi foreign ministry said on Saturday that it would not accept \"any infringement on the Palestinians' unalienable rights, and any attempts at displacement,\" accusing Israel of \"ethnic cleansing\".\nEgypt has also rejected any idea of the removal of the Palestinian population and has said it is calling an emergency summit of the Arab League on 27 February to discuss what it called \"serious\" Palestinian developments.",

During the trip, in the most dramatic shift in US policy regarding Gaza in decades, Trump called for the removal of the territory's entire civilian population and the development of what he called \"The Riviera of the Middle East\".Convening his first cabinet meeting since returning to Israel over the weekend, Netanyahu said Trump had come up with a \"completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel\". Many of those displaced were subsequently forced to move multiple times after Israeli forces pushed into southern Gaza, too.They were also prevented from returning to their homes through the Netzarim Corridor, stretching from the Gaza-Israel border to the Mediterranean Sea.Israeli forces partially withdrew from the west of the corridor last month and the first Palestinians - pedestrians - were allowed to walk along the coastal Rashid Street as they crossed into northern Gaza. \"We have no choice,\" he added.Mahmoud al-Sarhi, another displaced Palestinian, told AFP that for him \"arriving at the Netzarim Corridor meant death until this morning\".He said this was \"the first time I saw our destroyed house\", referring to his home in the nearby Zeitun area. The Saudi foreign ministry said on Saturday that it would not accept \"any infringement on the Palestinians' unalienable rights, and any attempts at displacement,\" accusing Israel of \"ethnic cleansing\".Egypt has also rejected any idea of the removal of the Palestinian population and has said it is calling an emergency summit of the Arab League on 27 February to discuss what it called \"serious\" Palestinian developments.Why does Trump want to take over Gaza and could he do it?Tears of joy as freed Thai hostages arrive homeWatch: Released Palestinian prisoners greeted in RamallahIsrael-Gaza warGaza"

        "article_text": "Angelababy has called Hong Kong home since she was a young girl. Here are her local insider picks, from shopping on Hollywood Road to hiking Dragon's Back.\nThe very name Hong Kong immediately conjures up luxury boutiques, wild nightlife, street food and spectacular architecture. We asked Hong Kong-based Hollywood actress and model Angelababy (Yeung Wing) to help us get to the heart of this dynamic place with so much to offer.\nThe SpeciaList\nChinese actress Angela Yang Ying, better known by her stage name Angelababy, moved to Hong Kong with her family at the age of 13 where she launched a meteoric modelling and film career. She went on to star in Mojin: The Lost Legend film, which, was on its release the highest-grossing Chinese-language IMAX film in China, and has starred in several Hollywood blockbusters. In 2016, she was named one of Forbes 30 Under 30.\nThe mega-famous actress and model \u2013 known for starring in the Chinese gameshow\u00a0Running Man\u00a0as well as various high-profile action films \u2013 has lived here since the age of 13, when her father's job brought the family from their native Shanghai.\n\"When I first arrived in Hong Kong, I was impressed by its skyline and harbour views,\" reminisces Angelababy. \"It's a very dynamic city. I felt that living here would be fun.\"\nThe future model soon found her new home was an exciting blend of cultures as well as modern and traditional architecture. \"Hong Kong is a real mix of East and West,\" explains Angelababy, about the former British colony. \"This is particularly evident in street names, most of which are directly translated from English and sound quite interesting.\"\nHong Kong's cultural celebrations include epic festivities like Lunar New Year in January when Victoria Harbour's sky is lit up with fireworks, the centuries old\u00a0Cheung Chau Bun Festival in May when competitors scramble up a tower of steamed buns filled with lotus paste and the thrilling Victoria Harbour river races of the Dragon Boat Festival in June. \"It's the culture that makes the city so special,\" says Angelababy.\nHere are Angelababy's favourite ways to explore Hong Kong.\nTo find the real Hong Kong, Angelababy recommends looking no further than a cha chaan teng\u00a0(tea restaurant). \"Tea houses are deeply rooted in Hong Kong's culinary culture. Traditional Hongkongers enjoy going to tea houses for lunch with family or friends.\"\nWhere to watch the Lunar New Year fireworks\nVisitors who want to watch the Lunar New Year fireworks (30 January 2025) in style could try this tip from Angelababy: \"Book a hotel like the Rosewood Hong Kong, The Peninsula Hong Kong or Regent Hong Kong,\" she says. \"At these hotels you can see the view of the fireworks and you can have your own private fireworks show.\"\nLocals and expats alike sit huddled around tables in these old-school cafes, which are decorated with whirling fans and patterned floor tiles. These iconic Hong Kong spots are known for serving European treats with an Asian twist, so expect cups of strong Hong Kong milk tea made with condensed or evaporated milk, flaky egg tarts and pineapple buns with a cracked surface resembling its spiky namesake fruit. \"If you're working on movies in Hong Kong, everybody stops at 15:15 for afternoon tea [and] we'll all enjoy an egg tart or a pineapple bun,\" says Angelababy. The actress has been hoping to try the newly renovated historic tea house Lin Heung Lau; originally established in the 1920s. \"So many friends say it's very good, but because it\u2019s so busy and hard to get a table, I haven't tried it yet,\" she says. \"But I know it will be worth it. You just have to see the videos.\"\nWebsite: https://linheunglau.shop/\nAddress: 160-164 Wellington Street, Central District, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 21160670\nInstagram: @linheunglau/?hl=en\nAnother culinary custom synonymous with Hong Kong culture is dim sum; a traditional Chinese brunch where a dazzling variety of small, savoury bites in bamboo baskets are wheeled through the restaurant on carts, to be shared with the whole table. \"[It's] quality time with family,\" says Angelababy. \"It's not just about filling the stomach; it's an experience.\" Hongkongers tuck into baskets of stewed, roasted or steamed dumplings such as char siu bao (doughy balls of sweet roast pork); siu mai (open-topped steamed dumplings); or soup dumplings filled with richly flavourful broth, which they wash down with tea.\nRide the Ding Ding\nAngelababy said that one of the most fun ways to travel around Hong Kong is on the double-decker tram that has been running since 1904. The super-skinny vintage tram can be found on Hong Kong Island. \"We call it the Ding Ding,\" says Angelababy. The name comes from the sound of the bell ringing twice that lets people know the tram is leaving.\nDim sum, which translates to \"touch the heart\" is believed to have originated in the port city of Ghangzhou and was brought by traders to Hong Kong in the 19th Century. It is now served across the city in five-star hotels and in tea houses. \"Hongkongers have a diverse palate, and dim sum encompasses a wide variety of dishes, perfectly catering to everyone's [tastes],\" says Angelababy. \"I believe the flavours of Hong Kong dim sum are unique; no matter how people from other countries try to imitate them, they seem unable to replicate those tastes.\"\nAngelababy loves to stop for dim sum at Lung Keen Heen in the newly renovated Four Seasons Hong Kong overlooking Victoria Harbour. \"I do prefer a window seat, but I don't mind any seat actually,\" she says. \"As long as I can get a table to dine there, I\u2019ll be happy.\"\u00a0Her picks: baked pineapple buns with barbecued pork and pine nuts along with a seasonal soup.\nWebsite: https://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong\nAddress: 4th floor, Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, 8 Finance Street, Central, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 3196 8882\nInstagram: @fshongkong/?hl=en\nHollywood Road was recently dubbed the second coolest street in the world by Time Out for its long history and constantly changing offerings. This historic street running between the Central and Sheung Wan neighbourhoods is filled with landmarks such as the 19th-Century Taoist Man Mo Temple, Michelin-starred restaurants, antique shops and galleries. Angelababy recommends a visit to G.O.D (Goods of Desire), which has quirky home buys. \"I love to stop at Hong Kong's creative art hub PMQ,\" she says, referencing the seven-storey 1950s former \"Police Married Quarters\", where the police and their families lived. \"There are many local designers' studios and workshops at PMQ. It's a very interesting place for creative exploration. [I\u2019ll visit] PMQ's [Night] Market, which has many small items, vintage goods and snacks.\"\nWebsite: https://www.pmq.org.hk/\nAddress: 35 Aberdeen Street\nPhone: +852 28702335\nInstagram:\u00a0@pmqhkdesign \u00a0\nHong Kong's hilly and mountainous terrain makes it great for outdoor sport. \"If I have visitors in Hong Kong, I will take them hiking,\" says Angelababy. \"That\u2019s one of the special things about Hong Kong. There are not that many cities where you can go hiking in nature in 30 or 40 minutes. You can just [pick up a bottle of] water and go.\"\nAngelababy recommends holidaymakers pull on their hiking shoes and hit Dragon's Back Mountain at Shek O Country\u00a0Park; a curvy mountain trail that overlooks Tai Tam Bay. \"It's not a hard walk and it comes with panoramic views,\" she says.\nDragon\u2019s Back Mountain can be found on the south-eastern corner of Hong Kong Island. The trek begins with a gentle walk that leads hikers through the forest, along the ridge of the mountain to Dragon's Back Viewing Point where people can see Stanley, Tai Tam Bay and Lamma Islands. \"You feel miles away from the city at Dragon\u2019s Back. I feel so relaxed when I'm there,\" says Angelababy. \"I [go] for a walk over Dragon\u2019s Back and then down to the white-sand beach of Big Wave Bay.\"\nWebsite: https://www.discoverhongkong.com/seasia/explore/great-outdoor/dragon-s-back-a-scenic-hike-from-shek-o-to-big-wave-bay.html\nAddress: Shek O Country Park\nPhone: +852 91878641\nInstagram:\u00a0@discoverhongkong\nHong Kong is home to 263 islands, including Lantau Island \u2013 known as \"the lungs of Hong Kong for its great swaths of indigenous forest \u2013 and the idyllic Lamma Island; a popular escape from the chaos of the mainland. Angelababy's Hong Kong island pick is the tranquil island of Tai O.\nHome to the Tanka boat people, Tai O's Venice-like canal is lined with 200-year-old fishermen\u2019s stilt houses. The fishermen on this island are famous for producing the island's salty shrimp paste used to add flavour and umami to many curries and sauces. Visitors can observe the fishermen puttering around the island in colourful sampan boats with their fresh daily catch.\nRecently, film crews have taken a shine to the historic island with its vintage shophouses; one even appeared on the Netflix show Restaurants on the Edge. But Angelababy loves heading to Tai O to see the island\u2019s famous pink dolphins. Despite their name, these beautiful, endangered creatures are actually white, only appearing pink due to the blood vessels that run close to the surface of their skin.\n\"I used to visit the island when I was young,\" she says. \" Now I take my son to see the pink dolphins. Last time, we arrived Tai O at 10:00 and then took a 30-minute boat tour out to sea to look for dolphins. I think you need some luck to see them, but not much. If you\u00a0go there in the good weather, you\u2019ve got a good chance.\"\nWebsite: https://www.discoverhongkong.com\nAddress: Tai O island\nPhone: +852 2508 1234\u00a0\nInstagram: @discoverhongkong\nProud mum Angelababy recommends that visitors check out Hong Kong Disneyland on Lantau Island or Hong Kong\u2019s own Ocean Park. First opened in the 1970s, this zoological theme park with more than 80 attractions has become one of the biggest theme parks in the world. \"It\u2019s really good for families,\" says Angelababy, who also enjoyed visiting as a teenager. \"The park has two parts. It\u2019s so big, you need to take the cable car. You can see Hong Kong\u00a0south\u00a0and [the] mountainside.\"\nFound within the park is a grand aquarium with more than 5,000 fish, as well as golden snub-nosed monkeys, penguins and now six pandas. \"There are two new pandas, and the\u00a0park [has] new born\u00a0[babies] too,\" says Angelababy. The Thai people may have Moo Deng, but the Hong Kongers have new baby pandas for visitors to peek at in February. \u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://www.oceanpark.com.hk/en\nAddress: Aberdeen, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 3923 2323\nInstagram:\u00a0@khoceanpark\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half. \nThe power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.\nThough there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated. \nCritics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.\nIt argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released. \nThe new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.\nThe government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all. \nIt says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal. \nMichael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".\nIn a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years. \nA \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.\n\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive. \nCampaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations. \n\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"\nThe new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.  \nAll the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada. \nBBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.\nIn response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.\nIt says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.\n\n",

The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all. Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",

It is becoming a classic rivalry of our times.\nThis will be the fourth time the football powerhouses have met in Europe in the last four seasons - but with one big difference.\nThis time, rather than being in the latter stages, both sides are fighting for their lives to merely make the last 16.\nSo how did two of Europe's most successful sides in recent seasons fail to make the top eight and end up in a play-off?\nWho is through in Champions League and what's next?\nFive ways a new format has transformed the Champions League\nMan City can still create something beautiful - Dias\nManchester City only limped into the play-offs with a last-gasp victory in their must-win final match against Club Brugge.\nA problem of their own making? Yes and no.\nManager Pep Guardiola had the chance to strengthen his squad at the end of the last Premier League title-winning season, but decided against it partly because he was unsure of his own future.\nHe seriously considered the interest from the English FA and, for a while, he was 70-30 in favour of becoming the next national team coach, with those around him assuring him it would bring him a quieter life.\nHe also trusted in his players - the squad who brought him four Premier League titles - and ultimately decided he still had a job to do at Manchester City\nIn November, City were top of the table and the only team in the top five leagues to be unbeaten. Then the wheels fell off.\nWhen Ilkay Gundogan returned in August, the original plan had been for him and Bernardo Silva to play about one out of every three games. \nAs things stand, Gundogan is just a couple of games away from playing 50% of the matches, which will mean an automatic renewal for him.\nRodri rupturing his cruciate knee ligament and injuries to potential replacements like Manuel Akanji and John Stones has been a key issue.\nAn out-of-sorts Phil Foden, Kevin de Bruyne struggling to maintain his customary high level and Jack Grealish being unable to demonstrate what a great player he could be, have exacerbated the problem.\nThe reality was there for all to see as a squad lacking energy laboured and went through the motions in training.\nThis video can not be played\nWhat's it really like to play under 'genius' Pep Guardiola?\nAny remaining uncertainty over Guardiola's City future was ended in the middle of December when he signed a one-year contract extension to take his stay at the club to 10 years.\nAgainst his own better judgement and contrary to the advice being offered by many of those closest to him, he decided now was not the time to leave despite the fact it was becoming clear a total recycling of his squad was needed.\nThe biggest names in the squad told him they were all with him and trusted he would take them out of the situation. \nHis authority was never questioned, even though some players have imagined their careers elsewhere.\nGuardiola is also battling his own body. He is low in natural defences because of the  excessive demands he places upon himself and, with everything in his life at the moment seeming to lack stability, he appears to be picking up every virus circulating. \nHe is not at his best and he is a very emotional person, but still he is influencing and being demanding to those around him.\nJust as things looked to be on the mend on the field, they were put to the sword by a revitalised Paris St-Germain in their penultimate league phase game.\nThen, after wins against Chelsea and Club Brugge, they were routed 5-1 at Arsenal. That is how people inside the club expect the rest of the season will be; hit and miss.\nWith Ruben Dias, Akanji, Josko Gvardiol, Stones and Nathan Ake waiting in the wings, Guardiola is hoping his side can soon once again show the form that earned them a Treble. \nAt the moment, though, a top-four finish would seem like a major triumph, as Guardiola sets about recycling further elements of his squad in addition to those already brought in. \nThe coaching staff have already heard their manager say that finishing in the top four would have to be celebrated almost as a fifth consecutive title - he feels it has been that hard.\nSporting Giants\nReal Madrid's route to this unexpected knockout game was not quite as laden with jeopardy as City's, but it has not been without its moments of drama.\nThree defeats in the group phase have left them with a game against a side they would normally expect to play in the latter stages.\nIt will not have escaped anyone's attention - particularly Manchester City's - that despite sitting on top of La Liga, this is a team that has fallen short whenever they have faced a major side at home or abroad this season.\nDefensively it has been carnage, with serious cruciate ligament injuries to major players such as Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao, long-term problems with David Alaba and a lengthy absence for Antonio Rudiger.\nBut defensive problems are only really the tip of the iceberg - as coach Carlo Ancelotti knows better than anyone.\nThey go into the match against City with a front three of Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Kylian Mbappe plus Jude Bellingham behind. \nThey have amassed 59 goals this season, but the trouble for Ancelotti is his superstars up front - Bellingham apart - have not always put in the necessary shift defensively.\nReal's wily boss saw potential problems at the start of the season and knew that unless they became more committed to the cause, it was going to be a long season.\nThe absence of Toni Kroos has made it more difficult for them to have control of games, with Real suffering from not replacing the retired midfielder.\nAny money they have spent has not been on replacing Kroos, but rather on Mbappe and other young, precocious talents.\nThey have also spent a lot of money on rebuilding their stadium, while complaints from the neighbours about noise means that concerts planned to take place at the new ground have been cancelled by the local licensing authorities. \nTo say this was a 'nice little earner' for the club does not even begin to describe the situation. This is a big financial blow to Real.\nVinicius Jr looked far more committed to the cause in Real's match against Atletico at the weekend, having been read the riot act by Luka Modric and Federico Valverde for failing to give his best during the club's quarter-final Copa del Rey match at Leganes.\nAncelotti continues to attempt to deal with a player who often looks like he is trying to take on the world, both on and off the pitch.\nHe appears to be carrying a heavy burden, which means we have not seen the best of him this season.\nLurking in the background is also the reported massive offer - some say about 1bn euros - from Saudi Arabia for him. \nAt the moment it is all talk and Real Madrid are leaving the door open without actually saying anything for or against the deal.\nAlthough, with Rodrygo having scored 13 goals from Vinicius' favoured left side, his departure would not be considered a fatal blow.\nMbappe, meanwhile, is the best he has been so far at the club. \nHe has decided to rely on his own skill and intuition and on being himself, and now everyone - Vinicius included - knows he is the focal point for Madrid.\nThe leadership pecking order is beginning to take shape, led by Mbappe and a much sharper Bellingham. Modric and Valverde also have a say, replacing the likes of Carvajal and Militao, who were at the forefront.\nDescribing Real Madrid as exposed seems something of an understatement. But as Ancelotti says, they have been winning with quality, if not commitment, and that is in abundance.\nSo who's going to bet against them?\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs are intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.\nThe Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.\nSince the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?\nI hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.\nMeredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.\nJeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.\nDharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as 'the most beautiful word in the dictionary' - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?\nJeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.\nFirstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.\nMeredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.\nHe observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.\nDD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?\nJF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.\n500 years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.\nDD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?\nJF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.\nSo what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.\nWe've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.\nWe need a new system.\nMC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.\nOver the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.\nOne, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.\nTrump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.\nDD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.\nMC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.\nOnce you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.\nOne of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.\nDD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?\nJF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.\nBut I want to go back to consumer prices.\nPeople focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.\nWhat we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.\nThe current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.\nDD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?\nMC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.\nIt is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.\nWhere I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.\nJF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.\nDD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?\nMC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.\nIf the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?\nIf the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.\nSo the spillover effects could be very, very negative.\nDD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?\nJF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.\nThe world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.\nSo what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.\n\nProduced by: Rosemary McCabe, Rhoda Buchanan and Harriet Whitehead\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity and brevity.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

I was quite confident of that.\n\"It didn't quite work out like that!\"\nHaving left the ministry Keith is now a successful artist, and his latest collection of paintings 'We're All Mad Here' reflects on neurodiversity and his own autism.\nIt was a big step to decide to become a full-time artist, but Keith said he \"can't remember a time when I didn't paint\".\n\"Going back to childhood, I think I captured every Disney character I could find,\" he said.\n\"I've always drawn ever since I was young.\"\nKeith's paintings, especially those of brightly lit and detailed streetscapes in Northern Ireland, are well known.\nHe told BBC News NI that his decision to leave his career as a church minister to take up art full-time was about \"recovery, it was also about survival\".\n\"I exhibited all the normal things that you would expect with an autistic person, but I had learnt also through the church very cleverly to mask most things,\" he said.\nIt was only when Keith's wife Deborah completed a doctorate in how technology could help reduce anxiety among autistic children, though, that he realised he may also be autistic.\nThe couple were also patrons of their local branch of the National Autistic Society charity.\nEventually it led him to seek a referral from his GP for an assessment.\n\"We thought, 'Well, OK, maybe that's what explains my history from five years of age and all the things that I've been trying to learn to control, things I've been learning to mask,'\" he said.\nKeith said his autism diagnosis made sense of a lot of things he had experienced since childhood.\nAt school he had been branded \"lazy\".\n\"From going right back to having late speech development in school, to having a lot of tics that I had to try and control,\" he said.\nAs he got older, he watched how other people dealt with social situations to help overcome his own anxiety.\n\"I had a friend who was extremely good with people, everybody loved him and I would watch how he worked with people, how he spoke to people, how he met people,\" he said.\n\"I would kind of copy that and learn.\n\"So I was aware my whole life there was all this going on.\"\n\"I think I'd felt like my whole life I'd been writing the book, but never had the preface or never had the table of contents that made sense of the book,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"All of a sudden this made sense and, to a degree, I think it took some of the pressure off me.\n\"I've always been very, very hard on myself if I failed in any kind of way or made mistakes.\n\"And I think the diagnosis of the autism allowed me to be a little bit easier on myself by understanding where much of this was coming from.\"\nAs Keith was a patron of the National Autistic Society he felt that going public about his late diagnosis could help others.\n\"Even to say to parents that this is not a negative thing, autism is a very broad spectrum,\" he said.\nThe striking paintings in 'We're All Mad Here' reflect his experiences and focus on mental health.\n\"Everyone is somewhere on some kind of spectrum,\" he said.\n\"There's no perfect human being, we're all strong in certain areas.\"\nThe title of the exhibition is based on a phrase from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and many of the paintings are based around the famous tale.\n\"At a simple level many of us feel we don't fit,\" Keith said.\nEma Cubitt is the Independent Autism Reviewer for Northern Ireland and she said that a diagnosis of autism in adults is becoming more prevalent.\n\"One of the key factors driving this increase is the growing recognition that autism is a natural variation within the human population,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"Several factors are likely to contribute to this rise in diagnosis, including increased awareness and recognition, evolving diagnostic criteria, improved reporting and data collection, and broader social and cultural shifts.\n\"As we deepen our understanding of autism, we gain valuable insights into the diversity of human experiences, which can only serve to enrich our society.\n\"The impact of a diagnosis varies from person to person, and autistic adults themselves provide the most powerful insights into what it means to receive this recognition later in life.\n\"We must ensure that our public services, including education and healthcare, evolve to meet the needs of autistic individuals, and that society as a whole fosters greater acceptance and support.\"",

        "article_text": "Truly vibrant red was elusive for many years: until a mysterious dye was discovered in Mexico. Devon Van Houten Maldonado reveals how a crushed bug became a sign of wealth and status.\nAlthough scarlet is the colour of sin in the Old Testament, the ancient world\u2019s elite was thirsty for red, a symbol of wealth and status. They spent fantastic sums searching for ever more vibrant hues, until Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the conquistadors discovered an intoxicatingly saturated pigment in the great markets of Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. Made from the crushed-up cochineal insect, the mysterious dye launched Spain toward its eventual role as an economic superpower and became one of the New World\u2019s primary exports, as a red craze descended on Europe. An exhibition at Mexico City\u2019s Palacio de Bellas Artes museum reveals the far-reaching impact of the pigment through art history, from the renaissance to modernism.\nIn medieval and classical Europe, artisans and traders tripped over each other in search of durable saturated colors and \u2013 in turn \u2013 wealth, amid swathes of weak and watery fabrics. Dyers guilds guarded their secrets closely and performed seemingly magical feats of alchemy to fix colours to wool, silk and cotton. They used roots and resins to create satisfactory yellows, greens and blues. The murex snail was crushed into a dye to create imperial purple cloth worth more than its weight in gold. But truly vibrant red remained elusive.\nFor many years, the most common red in Europe came from the Ottoman Empire, where the \u2018Turkey red\u2019 process used the root of the rubia plant. European dyers tried desperately to reproduce the results from the East, but succeeded only partially, as the Ottoman process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks\u2019 blood, according to Amy Butler Greenfield in her book, A Perfect Red. \nDyers also used Brazilwood, lac and lichens, but the resulting colours were usually underwhelming, and the processes often resulted in brownish or orange reds that faded quickly. For royalty and elite, St John\u2019s Blood and Armenian red (dating back as far as the 8th Century BCE, according to Butler Greenfield), created the most vibrant saturated reds available in Europe until the 16th Century. But, made from different varieties of Porphyrophora root parasites, their production was laborious and availability was scarce, even at the highest prices.\nMesoamerican peoples in southern Mexico had started using the cochineal bug as early as 2000 BCE, long before the arrival of the conquistadors, according to Mexican textile expert Quetzalina Sanchez. Indigenous people in Puebla, Tlaxcala and Oaxaca had systems for breeding and engineering the cochineal bugs for ideal traits and the pigment was used to create paints for codices and murals, to dye cloth and feathers, and even as medicine.\nCochineal in the New World\nWhen the conquistadors arrived in Mexico City, the headquarters of the Aztec empire, the red colour was everywhere. Outlying villages paid dues to their Aztec rulers in kilos of cochineal and rolls of blood-red cloth. \u201cScarlet is the colour of blood and the grana from cochineal achieved that [...] the colour always had a meaning, sometimes magic other times religious,\u201d Sanchez told the BBC.\nCort\u00e9s immediately recognized the riches of Mexico, which he related in several letters to King Charles V. \u201cI shall speak of some of the things I have seen, which although badly described, I know very well will cause such wonder that they will hardly be believed, because even we who see them here with our own eyes are unable to comprehend their reality,\u201d wrote Cort\u00e9s to the king. About the great marketplace of Tenochtitlan, which was \u201ctwice as large as that of Salamanca,\" he wrote, \u201cThey also sell skeins of different kinds of spun cotton in all colours, so that it seems quite like one of the silk markets of Granada, although it is on a greater scale; also as many different colours for painters as can be found in Spain and of as excellent hues.\u201d\nFirst-hand accounts indicate that Cort\u00e9s wasn\u2019t overly smitten with cochineal, more concerned instead with plundering gold and silver. Back in Spain, the king was pressed to make ends meet and hold together his enormous dominion in relative peace, so, although he was at first unconvinced by the promise of America, he became fascinated by the exotic tales and saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown\u2019s coffers. By 1523, cochineal pigment made its way back to Spain and caught the attention of the king who wrote to Cort\u00e9s about exporting the dyestuff back to Europe, writes Butler.\n\u201cThrough absurd laws and decrees [the Spanish] monopolised the grana trade,\u201d says Sanchez. \u201cThey obligated the indians to produce as much as possible.\u201d The native Mesoamericans who specialised in the production of the pigment and weren\u2019t killed by disease or slaughtered during the conquest were paid pennies on the dollar \u2013 while the Spaniards \u201cprofited enormously as intermediaries.\u201d\nRed in art history \nDye from the cochineal bug was ten times as potent as St John\u2019s Blood and produced 30 times more dye per ounce than Armenian red, according to Butler. So when European dyers began to experiment with the pigment, they were delighted by its potential. Most importantly, it was the brightest and most saturated red they had ever seen. By the middle of the 16th Century it was being used across Europe, and by the 1570s it had become one of the most profitable trades in Europe \u2013 growing from a meagre \u201c50,000 pounds of cochineal in 1557 to over 150,000 pounds in 1574,\u201d writes Butler.\nIn the Mexican Red exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the introduction of cochineal red to the European palette is illustrated in baroque paintings from the beginning of the 17th Century, after the pigment was already a booming industry across Europe and the world. Works by baroque painters like Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando and Luis Ju\u00e1rez, father of Jos\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, who worked their entire lives in Mexico (New Spain), hang alongside the Spanish-born Sebasti\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Arteaga and the likes of Peter Paul Rubens.\nL\u00f3pez de Arteaga\u2019s undated work The Incredulity of Saint Thomas pales in comparison to Caravaggio\u2019s version of the same work, where St Thomas\u2019s consternation and amazement is palpable in the skin of his furrowed forehead. But the red smock worn by Christ in L\u00f3pez de Arteaga\u2019s painting, denoting his holiness, absolutely pops off the canvas. Both artists employed cochineal, the introduction of which helped to establish the dramatic contrast that characterised the baroque style.\nA few steps away, a portrait of Isabella Brandt (1610) by Rubens shows the versatility of paint made from cochineal. The wall behind the woman is depicted in a deep, glowing red, from which she emerges within a slight aura of light. The bible in her hand was also rendered in exquisite detail from cochineal red in Rubens\u2019 unmistakable mastery of his brush, which makes his subjects feel as alive as if they were in front of you.\nMoving forward toward modernism \u2013 it wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 19th Century that cochineal was replaced by synthetic alternatives as the pre-eminent red dyestuff in the world \u2013 impressionist painters continued to make use of the heavenly red hues imported from Mexico. At the Palacio de Bellas Artes, works by Paul Gauguin, Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh have all been analysed and tested positive for cochineal. Like Rubens, Renoir\u2019s subjects seem to be alive on the canvas, but as an impressionist his portraits dissolved into energetic abstractions. Gauguin also used colour, especially red, to create playful accents, but neither compared to the saturation achieved by Van Gogh. His piece, The Bedroom (1888), on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, puts a full stop on the exhibition with a single burning-hot spot of bright red.\nAfter synthetic pigments became popular, outside of Mexico, the red dye was mass-produced as industrial food colouring \u2013 its main use today. Yet while the newly independent Mexico no longer controlled the valuable monopoly on cochineal, it also got something back \u2013 the sacred red that had been plundered and proliferated by the Spanish. \u201cIn Europe, as has happened in many cases, the history of the original people of Mexico has mattered very little,\u201d Sanchez told the BBC, but in Mexico \u201cthe colour continues to be associated with ancestral magic [and] protects those who wear attire dyed with cochineal.\u201d\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Tennis star Serena Williams made a surprise cameo during rapper Kendrick Lamar's halftime performance at the Super Bowl on Sunday, showcasing her crip walk - a dance move that originated in Los Angeles. \nThe moves were a reference to Williams and Lamar's shared roots in the city. \nBut the performance also recalled a Wimbledon controversy, when Williams faced criticism for a similar dance in celebration of her gold medal after defeating Maria Sharapova at the London Olympics in 2012. \nCritics at the time argued the dance was inappropriate and a glorification of gang violence. \nWilliams addressed the controversy in a video she posted on X of her backstage at the Super Bowl. \n\"Man I did not crip walk like that at Wimbledon,\" she said laughing. \"Oh, I would've been fined.\"\n\"It was all love,\" she added of the Super Bowl performance. \nThe crip walk was a move created by members of Los Angeles-area street gang the Crips in the 1970s.

And the language \u2013 that is very important,\" he says. \"Then there's the hymns\u2026 You know, we just love to sing \u2013 it's the air that we breathe.\"\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eight of the most stunning opera houses\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The extraordinary 'lost' opera composer\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThe Welsh bass-baritone is the subject of Peak Performance, part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera. Presented by Zeinab Badawi, it follows Sir Bryn \u2013 as he has been known since his knighthood in 2017 \u2013 from his operatic debut with the Welsh National Opera in 1990, to singing at opera houses across the world, like London's Royal Opera House, where he is a regular star performer. En route, the documentary revisits his roots in rural Wales and looks at how he's nurturing the next generations of singing talent, as well as his invitation to sing at King Charles's coronation.\nSir Bryn is high on the list of great living Welsh opera singers, which also includes luminaries such as Dame Gwyneth Jones, Wynne Evans, Katherine Jenkins, and Aled Jones. (Added to which there are many popular non-opera Welsh singers, including Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, Bonnie Tyler, Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews.) But beyond these headline stars lies a whole nation renowned for its love of singing, especially choral. So where does this passion for song stem from?\nIn A History of Music and Singing in Wales, novelist and poet Wyn Griffith, who wrote extensively on Wales and Welsh culture, observed: \"If you find a score of Welsh people, in Wales or out of it, you will find a choir. They sing for their own delight, and they always sing in harmony. They sing as naturally and easily as they talk.\"\n\"Wales is known as a nation of music \u2013 the 'land of song',\" notes the Welsh National Opera (WNO). \"Often connected with male voice choirs, it is\u2026 recognised for its choral traditions which are rooted in the culture.\"\nChoral singing in Wales dates back to the 19th Century, and flourished with the Cymanafa Ganu (hymn singing) movement, at a chapel in Aberdare in 1859; it was rooted mainly in religious songs, though a steady body of secular songs were also produced. Soon after, a revival of traditional Welsh music began with the formation of the National Eisteddfod Society, a focus for the Welsh passion for singing and song. Any worthy list of classic Welsh songs might include Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (O Land of My Fathers); My Little Welsh Home by William Sidney Gwynn Williams; and the love song Ar Lan y Mor (recorded by both Terfel and Jenkins). Or the rousing We'll Keep a Welcome (In the Hillsides).\nThe male voice choir, along with the harp, are two of the most popular signifiers of Welsh music. Professor Gareth Williams traces the male voice choir's origins to the mid-19th Century industrial age: \"We are reminded of what Aneurin Bevan once said: 'Culture comes off the end of a pick',\" he writes, referring to Welsh coal miners. Choirs started in the 1920s, like Cwbach from the Cynon Valley, and Pendyrus, survive today. After a day's hard graft in a mine, says Williams, the joy and community found in singing with co-workers was \"an assertion of working-class male bonding and identity expressed through that most democratic and inexpensive instrument, the human voice\".\nThe Welsh Borough Chapel in Southwark, London, is host to Eschoir, a Welsh male choir of around 20 singers, aged 20 to 75. Singing together since 2009, they've performed at Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Eschoir founder and director Mike Williams, who grew up in south Wales, describes their appeal: \"There's a humility to it, as Welsh choirs stem back to the coal mines and chapels. Many people enjoy singing in the pub as much as singing in a concert. There is no pomp\u2026 it unites us and keeps us connected to our Welsh roots.\" And the Welsh take choirs very seriously, he adds.\nIn tandem with a passion for choral singing in Wales, there has been a rise in popularity of the Eisteddfod. These Welsh singing and recital competitions date back to the 12th Century and today are a platform for public singing, especially for younger singers. It was at local Eisteddfods that the young Bryn Terfel first stood out, winning singing competitions that would lead him to study at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and to his first professional role in Cosi Fan Tutti at Welsh National Opera, soon after graduating in 1989.\nA unique cultural inheritance\nIn the documentary, Terfel recalls competing in Eisteddfods in his rural north Wales, and how his \"parents paid for a lot of petrol to drive me north, south, east and west to compete. They saw something in their son\u2026 the passion, how I loved singing. I think that drove them to encourage the singing within me.\" Eisteddfods are \"a wonderful shop window\", he says. One of his charitable initiatives is a scholarship to develop promising young performers coming up through Eisteddfods. Peak Performance visits one in Llanadog, near Swansea, as young singers of all genders, from the area and across Wales, prepare to get on stage and sing. \"This is where it all starts for us Welsh singers,\" says one teenage boy in the documentary. \"This is where we learn our craft.\" He believes when Welsh singers go to London to study, \"you can see the difference\u2026 they\u2019ve got some sort of\u2026 confidence.\"\nCertainly, Terfel was swaddled in song and music from the cradle. Born in 1967 in rural north Wales, his father was a farmer, his mother a special needs teacher who used music therapy in her work. The whole family, including older relatives, sang together and in choirs. \"My grandfather, my great-grandfather, had the love of singing,\" he says. \"There was constant learning going on in the kitchen, words on the cabinets. A little bit of rivalry as well, which is quite healthy.\"\nEilir Owen Griffiths, a composer and Eisteddfod adjudicator, explains what he looks for in a great singer: \"It's how the voice resonates, and the way it works with text.\" He describes Terfil's voice as \"like a beautiful double bass\" \u2013 but it's not just the incredible sound he generates: \"It's also the control he has \u2013 he can sing the most delicate pianissimo as well. It's a unique voice, very special.\" That quality \u2013 and cultural diversity \u2013 was drawn on when Sir Bryn sang at the coronation of King Charles, who personally chose him to perform; he sang Coronation Kyrie, a first in the Welsh language at a coronation. \"You have the rehearsals in the rooms\u2026 Then you have your fittings, and all of a sudden you're in your costume and make-up.\" And you're onstage, he says, \"portraying a character. And that's when the fun really does begin!\"\nThe documentary joins Terfel as he goes through his repertoire for a week in March: as well as the Barber of Seville at the Royal Opera House, he sings the title role in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool; then travels to a studio near Cardiff in Wales, to record an album of sea shanties \u2013 the likes of Drunken Sailor, and traditional folk songs like Fflat Huw Puw, \"about a sailor and his wonderful ship\".\nIt's a voice that continues to thrill audiences, whether in lead roles such as Mozart\u2019s Don Giovanni at the Royal Opera House; or Tosca by Puccini at Paris Opera Bastille; or Verdi's Falstaff, at Grange Park Opera, Surrey. As well as big opera houses, he performs for new audiences in concert halls too. Gillian Moore is artistic director of the South Bank Centre, where in recent months he sang extracts from two of Wagner's great roles: \"The fact he's passing that on to young singers makes total sense\u2026 When he's on stage, you cannot take your eyes off him.\"\nReturning to that question of why the Welsh love to sing, Wyn Griffith suggests it's about an irrepressible spirit \u2013 and it's simply in the blood: \"Whether they meet in tens or in thousands, in a small country chapel or in a vast assembly\u2026 they sing freely\u2026 It is not necessary to organise singing in Wales: it happens on its own.\"\nTake me to the Opera: Peak Performance is on BBC News Channel on 10 June at 13.30 and also on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

It doesn't mean we don't respect Rodri because he is a fantastic player. I think Rodri deserved to win it the year before.\"\nIn 2023, Lionel Messi won the award for a record eighth time after helping Paris St-Germain to the French league title. He then moved to Major League Soccer outfit Inter Miami and won the Leagues Cup, a competition for MLS and Mexican teams.\nRodri was an integral figure in City's 2022-23 Treble success, scoring the winner in the Champions League final triumph over Inter Milan.\nCity manager Pep Guardiola said there was \"absolutely not\" any resentment at his club over the incident. \n\"I was happy for Rodri but Vinicius made an extraordinary year as well,\" he said. \"He could deserve it, like in the past when [Lionel] Messi and Cristiano [Ronaldo] were fighting for it. So, the subject is over.\"\nAlthough Rodri will miss the game because of his cruciate knee injury, Vinicius Jr is expected to start for an injury-depleted Real side lacking a number of key defenders. Antonio Rudiger, Eder Militao, David Alaba and Dani Carvajal are all missing, with Ancelotti describing the situation as an \"emergency\".\nHowever, while City have also had major issues this term, and lost 5-1 at Arsenal eight days ago, Ancelotti is not expecting an easy night.\n\"It seems like it's a Clasico because we have played each other a lot of times in this competition,\" he said.\n\"I still think they are one of the best teams in Europe and have one of the best managers out there. He has always tried to play well and has brought a great deal to football in terms of attacking play. \n\"He is an innovator and I continue to believe in him.

        "article_text": "Is the world of opera becoming more inclusive? A new documentary, featuring conductor Antonio Pappano, explores the mission to open up the art form to everyone.\nConductor Sir Antonio Pappano is renowned for being a warm-hearted \"people person\". But there's one thing that makes his blood run cold: when he hears opera being accused of being an art form that's only for a wealthy elite. \"I get very offended by people who say we're elitist,\" he says passionately in a new documentary. This is \"a misconception that totally distorts the image of opera,\" he adds. \"The fact of the matter is, it's harder to get into a football game in London than it is to get into the [Royal] Opera House.\"\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is 'the land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eight of the most stunning opera houses\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis allusion to the beautiful game is not a frivolous one. When Pappano \u00a0became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (ROH) in 2002, he spoke of his love for popular music by stars such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Oscar Peterson, Joni Mitchell, and for musicals. \"I like football too,\" he added. \"Does that mean you can't like opera?\"\nBack then Pappano was 42, and the youngest conductor to lead ROH's orchestra. Some 700 operas later \u2013 \u00a0with many productions of the French and Italian repertoires; a good part of the Russian; Wagner, Strauss and contemporary works \u2013 and he is the subject of A Time of Change, presented by Zeinab Badawi, and part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera.\nThe documentary follows him from his modest roots, as the son of Italian immigrant parents who came from southern Italy to the UK, who worked hard to make ends meet. \u00a0They passed on their strong work ethic to him, and he learnt how to work with singers from his vocal coach father, flourishing as a musical talent in the \"the family business\". A Time of Change goes on to trace a career that includes assisting classical pianist Daniel Barenboim, through to a recent high, conducting the King's coronation service in May, featuring solos by Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel and South African soprano Pretty Yende.\nThe main focus of the film, though, is Pappano's mission to open up opera to everyone. \"Opera shouldn't cater just to one audience, or be focused on just one corner of the repertoire,\" he says. \"It must be open to the interests of many different people.\" While he asserts that the ROH, like every big opera house, wants to entice young audiences, he does concede: \"I think you have to be honest and say, yes, but younger people can't afford very expensive tickets, can they?\" \u00a0\nIt's true that the price of opera tickets can seem too high to be anything but a rare luxury for most, especially young people.\u00a0Halley Bondy, writing on the arts website Paste Magazine,\u00a0describes herself as someone who has been to the opera many times \"for a millennial\". And although she loves opera \u2013 \"from the hyper-real grandness to the unbelievable talent, to the\u00a0septuagenarian, fur-hatted audience\" \u2013 she\u00a0finds it \"easy to see why places like The Met [Metropolitan Opera\u00a0House\u00a0in NYC] are ailing in sales; young\u00a0people\u00a0just\u00a0don't go. It's too expensive, too arcane, too massive\u2026 The onus is on the opera houses to do a\u00a0better job of catering to the young.\"\nBondy has only managed to attend so often by being treated by a\u00a0\"ridiculously generous friend\" or chasing discounted tickets. \"Like everything else in the world, the opera is a lot of fun if you have gobs of money,\" she observes, but she concedes anyone could get in with the $25 [\u00a319.40] rush tickets, student tickets or\u00a0commercial\u00a0offers \u2013 which make it \"affordable,\u00a0if you just dig a little\".\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nIn opera's defence,\u00a0ticket prices are generally high because it is notoriously costly to produce. All the more reason, argued The Guardian's Charlotte Higgins in February, for adequate government funding. Discussing\u00a0recent\u00a0cuts to\u00a0opera funding, she wrote:\u00a0\"If you starve something, run it down constantly, gradually\u00a0reduce the provision of it so that few can\u00a0afford it, it\u00a0becomes 'elitist'\u2026 And if opera in the form that its creators imagine it becomes for toffs, that is nothing to do with opera itself\u2026 [it is] precisely\u00a0the result of neglect and\u00a0underfunding\".\u00a0\nPappano is also invested in bringing new blood to opera, via schemes like the ROH's \u00a0schools matinees, which offer young people low-cost tickets to opera productions. Also, its Youth Opera talent development programme gives children aged seven to 13 the chance to try its \"rigorous music and drama training\".\n\"We make sure there's a real variety of socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities, and an even gender split,\u201d says Tom Floyd, ROH senior opera manger, talking about its open recruitment system. Most of the young people who join them \"come from families who probably have had no real experience of opera,\" he says.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nOpera for all\nOver at English National Opera (ENO), the company has stayed true to its egalitarian roots of the late 19th-Century, when theatrical producer Lilian Baylis and music director Charles Corri shared a vision of it as a place for \"people's opera\". ENO has \"opera for all\" in its mission statement. It does not assume knowledge of opera; its website has \u00a0key figures of the organisation \u00a0explaining what opera is and how it's made; and \u00a0the site hints at how it skillfully reimagines crowd pleasers, like La Traviata (to be performed this October), in thrilling new ways, alongside daring new work, such as 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, by performance artist Marina Abramovich (November).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"We sing in English to be accessible to the widest possible audience,\" an ENO spokesperson tells BBC Culture. The company offers free tickets for under-21s; discounts for under 35s, and tickets from \u00a310 for all. No surprise, then, that more than half its bookings last season were from opera first-timers.\nStill, in order to survive the cuts to Arts Council England (ACE) funding, the ENO will next year move its main base from the London Coliseum to outside the capital and in so doing will \u00a0qualify for \u00a324m funding over three years.\nOpera must change, ACE chief executive Darren Henley wrote in an article for The Guardian: \"A new generation is embracing opera and music presented in new ways: opera in car parks\u2026 in pubs, opera on your tablet\". In truth, most opera companies are not digital-age dodgers; they have presences on the popular digital platforms, while the hashtag #operaisopen invites new audiences to click through. \u00a0\nStreaming services \u2013 \u00a0like Royal Opera Stream and Glyndebourne Encore \u2013 have dished up productions and events, both popular and esoteric, to reach a wider audience. And there's also opera at the cinema. At ROH, 2022/23 has been its biggest cinema season ever, with more than 1,300 cinemas worldwide having shown or showing 13 productions (opera and ballet), including Madam Butterfly, La Boheme and Aida. The latter, staged in May and June 2023, was conducted by Pappano.\nNurturing promising young talent \u2013 like soprano Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha \u2013 is a passion of Pappano\u2019s, and he's also a role model for young opera conductors, like Avishka Ederisinghe, who says that watching him talking on YouTube was what inspired him to explore the art form.\u00a0\nAs he steps down from his music director roles \u2013 at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome after 18 years, and at ROH next summer, after 22 years \u2013 Pappano is looking forward to change. He will not be hanging up the baton yet: he will succeed Simon Rattle to become chief conductor at the London Symphony Orchestra, his \"dream job\". \u00a0\nHe describes how he grew up in a council flat that was just \"a four-minute walk to Westminster Abbey\"; and that rising from his humble background to conducting the coronation at that same abbey was \"not a bad gig\". Jokes aside, there is a message there that \u00a0he'd love to hand down to a younger generation: \"If you have a vision for what you want to achieve in life, that spark and\u2026 the energy and resilience to keep pushing when you know things will get tough, you can make it in any walk of life.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nTake me to the Opera: A Time of Change is on BBC News Channel and\u00a0on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "From Nubian Markets to the National Center for Afro-American Artists, a local tour guide offers his picks for the best places to see Boston's Black culture\nBoston is a city of neighbourhoods, and if you wander off the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail that passes through 16 significant sites in US history, you'll find extraordinary stories tucked in every nook and corner. Getting visitors to explore the city's varied cultural districts has long been a goal of Collin Knight, who founded Live Like a Local Tours in 2019. As a native of Roxbury, the neighbourhood that's the beating heart of Boston's Black community, he's working to highlight the city's rich African American culture while also acknowledging Boston's history of racial tensions.\u00a0\nThough Boston is perhaps most famous for its strong Irish roots, the city's Black history runs deep. Prior to the US Civil War, Boston was one of the most important stops on the Underground Railroad. The first chartered branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People civil rights organisation was founded here in 1911. Malcolm X moved to Boston 30 years later, followed by Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who considered the city his \"second home\" and fell in love with his would-be wife, Coretta Scott King, here. Today, 25 percent of Boston's population is Black \u2013 twice the percentage of the Black population in the US.\u00a0\n\"When we look at downtown, the city's Eurocentric history is being glorified each and every day. They're not really talking about Native Americans and African Americans and their plight within this country and Boston's connection to slavery,\" Knight says. \"I'm trying to figure out how we can tell the whole history of Massachusetts in the city of Boston instead of just telling one part.\"\u00a0\nHere are Knight's suggestions of the five best places in Boston to experience the city's vibrant modern-day Black culture, as well as the ties to its past.\n1.\u00a0The National Center for Afro-American Artists\u00a0\n\"The National Center for Afro-American Artists (NCAAA) houses art from some of the most prominent African American artists that have lived in the Boston area or are from the Boston area. A lot of people don't know much about it,\" Knight says. \"Dr Barry Gaither has been the curator of that museum since 1968. It was created by Dr Elma Lewis, who was the grande dame of the arts within the Boston area for many years. She was very well known for providing arts and culture to young people of colour within Boston, and Roxbury specifically.\"\u00a0\nKnight's must-see experiences within the museum include seeing the narrative paintings of Roxbury legend Allan Crite, known as the \"Dean of African American artists\" in New England, thanks to his nearly 90-year career. Another highlight, says Knight, is the ASPELTA exhibit displaying artefacts from Nubia. The exhibit features scores of 2,600-year-old objects recovered by archaeologists from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard University, including a fully-accurate recreation of the interior of a Nubian tomb. \"It's pretty incredible,\" Knight says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://ncaaa.org/\nAddress: 300 Walnut Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-442-8614\nFacebook:@themuseum_ncaaa\n\n2. Nubian Markets\u00a0\nThis sprawling new grocery store, halal butcher shop and fast-casual cafe, which opened in Roxbury in spring 2023, celebrates the food of the African diaspora. Its shelves are stocked with hard-to-find produce and vegetable items, and more than 30 Black-owned brands. \"It's absolutely incredible when you think about it: the halal approach, the restaurant/supermarket approach and the fact that it's a Black-owned supermarket in the middle of Roxbury,\" Knight says, noting that, historically, most grocery stores in the neighbourhood had been white-owned or run by white conglomerates.\u00a0\n\"This is a very powerful thing for us as Black people,\" Knight added. \"It's not something that we've ever had in our own community\u2026 They are focused on supporting other local businesses and other vendors of colour across the country.\"\nCuts of lamb, beef, and goat sold at the shop are raised following Islamic standards to feed the city\u2019s growing Muslim population, and many products on its shelves, sauces and spice mixes, are produced by local artisans like Cameroon native Paulette Ngachoko, founder of Hapi African Gourmet. In the cafe, menu items range from ginger beef and injera bowls to pea fritters and lamb couscous. \"I'm just excited about everything they're doing,\" Knight says.\nWebsite: https://www.nubianmarkets.com/\nAddress: 2565 Washington Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-608-4940\nInstagram: @nubianmarkets\n3. Comfort Kitchen\nThis cosy Black-, immigrant- and woman-owned restaurant opened in January 2023 in Dorchester's Uphams Corner neighbourhood. It was nearly a decade in the making and comes with its own dose of history: it's housed inside a 1912-built building that is on the National Register of Historic Places.\u00a0\n\"I love the owners over there. You think about the vibe that's in there, you think about the menu and how it's connected to the African diaspora,\" Knight says. \"[The building] was a comfort station [public restroom] for people travelling from the Dorchester area to the South Shore.\"\u00a0\nInside the former bathroom, the chic 30-seat space has curved pale-pink banquettes that are an Instagram favourite. Cocktails feature Equiano, an Afro-Caribbean rum produced in Mauritius and Barbados, or pay tribute to Black engineering pioneer Lewis Latimer, who worked alongside Alexander Graham Bell to develop the telephone in Boston in the 1880s. (Non-alcoholic drinks include a take on Tootsie, a Ghanaian fermented beer or a baobab mocktail.) For dinner, munch on jackfruit sliders, jerk roasted duck or za'atar brown butter trout.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.comfortkitchenbos.com/\nAddress: 611 Columbia Road, Dorchester\nPhone: 1-617-329-6010\nInstagram: @comfortkitchenbos\n4. Wally's Cafe and Jazz Club\u00a0\nWally's is an institution in Boston's South End neighbourhood, and when founder Joseph Walcott opened the club in 1947, he was the first African American nightclub owner in New England. Walcott got his start by drawing \u2013 and often driving \u2013 musicians up from New York City and created one of the few spaces in Boston during the time of segregation where anyone of any race could mingle. Today his grandchildren run the space, which hosts music 365 nights a year, often drawing from talented students at Berklee School of Music, the New England Conservatory and other nearby institutions. It's considered the oldest jazz club in the city.\u00a0\n\"What most people don't realise is there were jazz joints and juke joints up and down Massachusetts Avenue. That is the last of a dying breed that we had all over [the area] back in the day.\u00a0All of the greats came to play,\" says Knight \u2013 among them Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday. Check the schedule for their funk, jazz, and salsa offerings, which run from 17:00 to 01:00 nightly.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://wallyscafe.com/\nAddress: 427 Massachusetts Ave., South End\nPhone: 1-617-828-1754\nInstagram: @wallyscafejazzclub\n5. The Embrace\u00a0\nThis new, massive bronze sculpture was unveiled on Boston Common this year, celebrating Boston's civil rights legacy and commemorating the period that Dr Martin Luther King Jr lived in Boston. King attended theology school at Boston University in the 1950s and met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who was attending the New England Conservatory of Music, while living in the city.\nThe sculpture, by artist Hank Willis Thomas, is an abstract depiction based on a photo of the couple embracing after King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. It also recognises a moment in April 1965 when the leader stood on the park before a crowd of 22,000 and called for Boston to live up to its ideals and create a more equitable city.\u00a0\nWhile the sculpture alone \"is a really beautiful piece to tell that history, I think, more importantly, if you look at the grounds of The Embrace, you see all of these names [of people who marched alongside King and helped expand his ideas],\" Knight says. \"It's really about all of the local community advocates that have made a difference within the Roxbury community and the Boston community at large.

        "article_text": "Ecuador's presidential election will go to a second round after a closely contested first-round result failed to produce an outright winner.\nThe electoral authorities called it a \"technical tie\" after the incumbent centre-right candidate, Daniel Noboa, and his main left-wing challenger Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez received nearly identical percentages of the vote.\nThe pair will now face a run-off in April. The result is far narrower than opinion polls had predicted, indicating the second round could be harder to call. \nAs of 17:00 local time (22:00 GMT), with more than 94% of the ballots counted, Noboa had a 44.2% share of the vote and Gonz\u00e1lez 43.9%, according to local media.\nThe narrow result also dashed the hopes of Noboa's supporters, who had been buoyed by an early exit poll suggesting he might clinch victory outright.\nThe president's supporters gathered in Quito, waving flags, donning T-shirts with his image and holding life-size cardboard cut-outs of the incumbent president.\nThese cut-outs, depicting Noboa in various outfits \u2013 from suits to tank tops and sunglasses \u2013 have become ubiquitous symbols across the country decorating front doors, apartment windows, and even car rooftops.\nNoboa's presidency has been defined by his focus on tackling severe gang violence. \nHe implemented emergency measures to deploy the military to streets and prisons to curb rising crime.\nMany of his supporters hope he will secure a mandate in the run-off to continue his security policies.\n\"He's helped us a lot, from when there was gang violence so bad that we couldn't even go out,\" said Fernanda Iza.\nThe 45-year-old added: \"The support of the military he's introduced \u2013 their presence is already helping. \n\"He has brought us a certain stability. There are many problems still pending, but I hope he continues with his plan.\"\nJuan Diego Escobar, 16, expressed optimism about Noboa's chances.\n\"I think the majority of people who voted for other candidates will prefer to vote for Daniel Noboa in the second round,\" he said. \n\"Noboa handles insecurity well. Crime is fairly well controlled. I think he will also improve the economy.\"\nMiriam Naranjo said despite being the incumbent, Noboa represented \"change\".\nShe added: \"We need the work that he has been doing so far to continue. It's only been a short time. We were expecting a bigger margin, so we have to work to keep that support for our candidate.\"\nDespite some successes, such as the capture of some major gang leaders and a slight reduction in prison violence, violent crime remains a major issue.\nViolent deaths fell in 2024 but stayed near record levels. In January 2025 alone 750 homicides were reported.\nGonz\u00e1lez \u2013 a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former president Rafael Correa \u2013 has criticised Noboa for failing to deliver on key promises, such as boosting the economy, cutting fuel prices, and addressing violent crime.\nWhile she has proposed similar military and police operations to combat crime, her campaign has emphasised increased social spending in Ecuador's most violent regions.\nNoboa's critics also accused him of a slow response to a severe drought that led to prolonged power cuts last year.\nThe incumbent also sparked controversy during the campaign by refusing to delegate his presidential duties to Vice-President Ver\u00f3nica Abad, citing an electoral law loophole. \nThis decision became part of a public spat between the two.\nLuisa Gonz\u00e1lez's supporters see her as a chance for change.\nGonzalo Cajas, 46, said: \"Why is there crime? There is poverty. There is hunger. So there should be someone who is really aware of Ecuadorean workers so that the country moves forward.\"\nAlejandra Tufi\u00f1o, 42, added: \"The country's security is in pieces. I want change. I'm not saying that she's going to solve it \u2013 but let's see what happens if we give her a chance.\"\nSome voters remain disillusioned with both candidates. \nGabriela Cajo, 39, who backed a candidate from the party of assassinated 2023 presidential hopeful Fernando Villavicencio, expressed frustration with the lack of progress on crime.\n\"Daniel Noboa represents fear, and we represent hope, change. We do not want a state of war, we want peace,\" she said.\n\"I think we are all annoyed with the electoral processes in the country, and the last thing we want is a second round and more expenditure of resources. \n\"There will be tremendous polarisation. There will be a lot of opposition to whoever wins. Once again, we will have to choose who is the least worst.\"\nWhoever is victorious in April will face significant challenges.\nEcuador continues to grapple with rampant crime, as drug cartels battle for control of lucrative trafficking routes through its ports. Kidnappings and murders remain daily occurrences.\nThe country is also struggling with high unemployment, a weak economy, and an energy crisis that caused blackouts of up to 14 hours last year.\nNoboa has pledged to address these issues by creating jobs, attracting investment, and increasing renewable energy production. \nMeanwhile, Gonz\u00e1lez has emphasised the need for economic reform, social investment, and a stronger focus on tackling poverty.",

        "article_text": "Scientists have cracked the perfect way to boil an egg \u2013 astonishingly, it takes half an hour.\nIt is one of the undisputed facts of life that it is notoriously difficult to cook a perfectly boiled egg. Breakfasts can often be disappointing affairs when, after cracking the shell and dipping your toasted soldier into what you hope will be a culinary delight, you instead find that your yolk is dry and crumbly, or even worse, the egg white is a slimy watery mess.\nThe problem is that the yolk and albumen (the white part of the egg) cook at two different temperatures. Yolk requires a temperature of just 65C (149F) to cook, while the albumen needs a little more heat at 85C (185F).\nConventional methods for cooking eggs, therefore, represent a compromise between those two seemingly incompatible truths. Hard-boil an egg at 100C (212F), and the white will soon become tender and just right. The yolk, however, will be fully set \u2013 which is alright if you like that sort of thing, but disappointing if you're after a soft, runny yolk. Another method of cooking an egg, known as sous vide, involves placing the egg in a water bath at temperatures between 60 and 70C (140-158F) for one hour. This leaves the yolk deliciously runny, but the white can be left slimy and clear.\nHowever, worry not, as researchers have now discovered the perfect method for boiling an egg. What's more, they have shown that the result is not only tastier, but better for you too.\nHow easy is the method to follow?\nI like a runny yolk, so to find out if the periodic method really works, I convinced my husband \u2013 who used to work as a professional chef \u2013 to try it. Although, at first, he was aghast at the idea of boiling an egg for 32 minutes, he diligently performed the instructions as close to the letter as possible. The result, considering the effort he put in, was slightly disappointing. Although the white was pleasingly firm and less watery than that of a soft-boiled egg, the yolk was not runny enough for my taste. It didn\u2019t ooze in the way it ought to. But perhaps one or two minutes less would have made all the difference.\nIn their new paper, researchers led by Pellegrino Musto, a scientist working at Italy's National Research Council in Pozzuoli, first simulated the egg-cooking process using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD is the science of using computers to predict how liquids and gases flow based on the physical laws governing them, such as conservation of mass, momentum and energy.\nThe simulations suggested a new method \u2013 one likely to be entirely unfamiliar to most chefs and amateur cooks \u2013 that might give superior results. The approach, which the authors call periodic cooking, involves alternating between cooking the egg in a pan of boiling water kept at 100C (212F), and placing it into a luke-warm bowl kept at 30C (86F). To get the best results, the egg must be transferred between the two temperatures every two minutes for a total duration of 32 minutes, so it is probably not best suited to home cooks who like to dip in and out of the kitchen leaving their egg unsupervised.\nIf you are willing to put in the effort, however, your rewards will be plentiful. When scientists tried the new method in real life, the resulting egg was exceptional. The researchers confirmed this superiority by analysing the texture, sensory qualities and chemical structure of their perfectly boiled egg using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.\nThe results showed that periodically cooked eggs had a soft yolk similar to that of a sous vide egg \u2013 so far so good. However, unlike eggs cooked sous vide, the white albumen was not runny and uncooked, but instead had a consistency closer to that of a traditionally soft-boiled egg. According to the paper's authors, this is probably because, while temperatures in the periodically cooked egg white ranged between 35C (95F) and 100C (212F) during cooking, the yolk remained at a consistent temperature of 67C (153F) throughout.\nPerhaps most interestingly, chemical analysis revealed that the yolk of periodically cooked eggs contained more polyphenols \u2013 a group of micronutrients mostly found in plants, and touted for their health benefits \u2013 than eggs cooked by other methods. This class of compounds is renowned for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Plants make them as a defence against stressful environmental conditions such as UV radiation, droughts or predation by insects. However, research increasingly shows they can benefit humans too. For example epidemiological studies suggest that high dietary intake of polyphenols is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, specific forms of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.\nEven more reason to try periodically cooked eggs next time you fancy dippy eggs and soldiers for breakfast.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Food is life for this meal-obsessed island, especially when you're feeling poorly \u2013 including a spicy soup that soothes flu symptoms and a beloved chocolate drink that brings comfort.\nA few years ago, my girlfriend and I landed in Singapore after a winter holiday in Europe. Coughing, dizzy, our throats rusty and inflamed, we were far from well. But help was at hand. My (future) Singaporean mother-in-law came to the rescue, stocking our fridge with liquid medicine: congee. We spooned the thick, savoury rice porridge down our throats, feeling a little better with every swallow.\u00a0\nWarm and filling but gentle on the stomach, in good times congee is a power dinner in and of itself, and endlessly remixable. You can top it with a runny egg, chopped chives and coriander or neon splashes of garlic-chilli oil, and eat like a king. Or when sick, you can cut the tempting add-ons to a bare minimum and still be left with the soothing starch and heat. No wonder congee and its cousins are a key flu go-to in Singapore, Malaysia, China, South Korea \u2013 almost any place in East Asia where rice is a staple.\nSo strong is this porridge's connection to illness that some people can only stomach it when they're under the weather. Like Yuri Cath, a Japanese Indonesian who recently became a Singaporean citizen. \"I had a negative association with congee for the longest time because I only had it when I was sick,\" she says, echoing a sentiment of many locals. \"So, having it kind of made me feel ill.\" Not for long though, she laughs \u2013 the flavours won her over again, \"and I love congee now\".\nIt's tempting to call congee the king of flu food, but this is Singapore, one of the\u00a0most culinary-obsessed nations on Earth, and competition is fierce. A literal melting pot, the island's official languages are English, Tamil, Malay and Mandarin, representing the many cultures that form its core population. Each brings with it enough comfort dishes to soothe an army.\nWhere to eat yourself well in Singapore\nCongee:\u00a0Variety is the name of the game at\u00a0Mui Kee Congee, where your porridge can come loaded with sliced pork, beef, fish balls or abalone, to name just a few options.\n\nRasam:\u00a0Banana Leaf Apolo\u00a0boasts several locations, including one in the heart of Singapore's Little India. Their menu is extensive, but leave room for this stomach-settling dish.\nTamarind:\u00a0Looking for a food souvenir? Visit\u00a0DriedFoodSG, a multi-generation business brimming with dried goods, including tamarind paste or slices, which can be added to stews for an unmistakable flavour boost.\nBak kut teh:\u00a0Multiple businesses fight for the claim of best bak kut teh on bustling Balestier Road, including\u00a0Kai Juan Eating House\u00a0and the aptly named\u00a0Balestier Bak Kut Teh. The latter is open 24 hours a day.\nMilo:\u00a0Head to\u00a0Toast Box, a local cafe chain with more than 80 outlets famed as a popular pre-work breakfast spot. Order Milo hot or cold with kaya toast (bread with sweet coconut spread) on the side. A sugary but comforting pick-me-up.\nHippocrates would have liked this nation of six million hungry souls. The Ancient Greek thinker and physician, who once said, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,\" could witness his words come alive as a daily habit in Singapore's restaurants, homes and 120\u00a0hawker centres\u00a0boasting 6,000 stalls. Below are just some of the health-giving dishes and ingredients Hippocrates would approve of.\nSingaporean Syazana Izzati has vivid memories of her mother taking care of her when she was a child. Not with prescription pills, but with a long-held Malay practice that uses food as medicine.\n\"Whenever my siblings and I were running a fever, she used to do this thing where she'd wet our foreheads and hair,\" Izzati recalls. \"As we were lying down on bed, with a towel placed on our brow, she'd wet it with tamarind water.\" Why tamarind, or\u00a0asam\u00a0as it's known in Malay? \"Because it has cooling effects,\" she explains, \"and lowers the body temperature.\"\nTraditional Malay Medicine, like many ancient healing methods across Asia, leans deeply on jamu, or herbal and plant-based treatments like Izzati's fever poultice. \"These days, I just rely on painkillers,\" she laughs. But that may change, she says. Should she have children, she'll turn to tamarind on their feverish days \u2013 just like her mother and grandmother before her.\nBut tamarind is too popular to be used as a poultice alone. Some ingredients are so revered they crop up in other healing dishes, from cultures thousands of miles away.\nSome 5% of Singapore's population is made up of people with Indian Tamil heritage, who regularly turn to one of the tastiest flu cures you can fit in a bowl. Colourful but light, rasam, a broth originating in South India, is more than the sum of its parts. Its base consists of spices like pepper, turmeric and cumin along with garlic, onions and tomatoes \u2013 and, yes, tamarind again, in this case acting as a souring agent that gives the broth its addictive tart flavour. As a paper by two Indian medical researchers notes, rasam's ingredients are so therapeutic that the dish constitutes a \"functional food\", whose ingredients provide benefits above and beyond their nutritional value.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda\u00a0noted\u00a0when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation. Troubled by his ailing son's health and waning appetite, an ancient king of Madurai in Tamil Nadu province offered a reward for anyone who could make his child eat. One enterprising chef presented a humble bowl of rasam, which was promptly slurped up by the patient. Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda noted when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation. Troubled by his ailing son's health and waning appetite, an ancient king of Madurai in Tamil Nadu province offered a reward for anyone who could make his child eat. One enterprising chef presented a humble bowl of rasam, which was promptly slurped up by the patient. Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nToday it remains a popular pick-me-up from the flu and is prized particularly for its decongestant properties. Bak kut teh is often eaten late at night, when the day is cooler. That's because it's considered a \"heaty\" soup in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) due to its herbal make-up. The spectrum of internal \"heatiness\" and \"cooling\" are core concepts within TCM, a popular practice in Singapore. Excessive heatiness, for example, may see the body erupt in a fever, sore throat and irritability, while the inverse can lead to paleness and fatigue. The key is to balance your warm yang energy with yin, its cooler counterpart.\nAce Tan, head chef at the newly opened fine-dining restaurant ASU, is a strong believer in this balance. His childhood was steeped in the ancient health system: Ace would often visit TCM stores run by his aunts and uncles. It spurred a passion in him to understand what ingredients affected the body, and how. \"The practice of consuming specific ingredients during each season is deeply rooted in the Asian philosophy of the five elements,\" Ace says: \"wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements are intricately connected to our body systems. By consuming certain ingredients, we nourish specific body parts, ensuring a continuous cycle of cultivation and overall well-being.\"\nSo how does Ace cool himself down when balance is disrupted? \"I do have a strong affiliation\u00a0towards\u00a0two drinks in particular,\" he says, both commonly drunk as teas: \"chrysanthemum and barley, as they help mitigate the heat of my body system, preventing sore throats and fever.\"\nSometimes, however, you just need comfort above all. That's where Milo comes in, a chocolate drink sold in practically every hawker centre in town. The brand is so beloved that a paper at the National University of Singapore Centre for Governance and Sustainability dryly noted: \"It has even humorously been suggested that Milo flows through the veins of Singaporeans.\"\nThey're not wrong. During the Covid-19 pandemic, ad-hoc medical centres gave thousands of patients a care package with critical necessities such as toothpaste, crackers \u2013 and sachets of Milo powder.\nThough it originated in Australia in the 1930s, Milo became popular in many British colonies in Asia, including Singapore. In a 2019 lecture at the National Museum of Singapore, historian Dr Geoffrey Pakiam explained how, once the island achieved independence in the mid-1960s (first from Britain, and then from the Federation of Malaysia, which it briefly joined), Milo was marketed \"as a national drink\". In 1984, Milo began to be manufactured locally as well, further cementing a homegrown connection with the beverage.\nWhat makes this best-selling drink such a treat for the poorly? In part, it's because Milo is an embedded part of childhood, served at school canteens, birthday parties and picnics. That connection continues as people age or join mandatory National Service (NS). Loong Lim, who served his NS decades ago, shares that \"for a lot of guys, Milo will still bring back memories of the night snack you get in the army, when training ends late.\" Drunk by young Singaporeans drenched in sweat and mud, Milo has revived many a tired soldier, who will likely serve it to their child one day should illness strike. Followed, perhaps, by a soothing bowl of congee.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "After unearthing a rare collection of highly prized Silk Road artefacts, a family in the Himalayas has opened a museum dedicated to one of the fabled route's final traders.\nMuzzamil Hussain was in grade school when the first bombs fell on the playground outside of his classroom in Kargil, a mountain city in the Indian province of Ladakh. While the violent onset of the 1999 Kargil war between Pakistan and India unfolded around him, Hussain and his family escaped south to the remote Suru Valley.\nAfter India claimed victory later that year and displaced families returned home, Hussain listened as his bedridden grandfather asked the family to visit an old property, originally built by Hussain's great-grandfather, near Kargil's bazaar to make sure it had survived the war. When Hussain's uncles cracked through an old rusty latch and peered through the hand-carved wooden doors, they discovered wooden crates stamped with names of cities around the world. Making space on the dusty floor, the family began to lay out silks from China, silver cookware from Afghanistan, rugs from Persia, turquoise from Tibet, saddles from Mongolia and luxury soaps and salves from London, New York and Munich.\u00a0\nThey had found an abandoned treasure trove \u2013 a collection that would soon become recognised as one of the finest family-owned collections of Silk Road artefacts in India and a discovery that would change the course of Hussain's life.\nThat was 25 years ago. Today, centuries after it provided a crucial-yet-harrowing thoroughfare for Silk Road traders, the Himalayan mountain pass of Zoji La connecting Kashmir to Ladakh is still known as one of the most dangerous roads in the world. On a recent visit, my palms began to sweat as our 4x4 groaned its way higher up the mountainside. I glanced nervously out the window towards a glaciated peak at eye level, and the valley floor more than 1,000m below. No matter how close I pressed my nose against the window, I could not find the edge of the dirt road; just air and a long way to fall. In the front passenger seat, Hussain texted one of the many enterprises he runs with his family, including two hotels, two museums, a conservation NGO and a tour guide service. This was a regular commute for him, and one that his family had braved for centuries.\nI first met Hussain in 2023 while searching for snow leopards in eastern Ladakh. While sipping pink Kashmiri noon chai in a snow flurry at 4,265m, he told me stories of his own remarkable connection to the Silk Road. His flashbacks began with war, flirted with buried treasure and ended in reconciliation. As an archaeologist enamored with mountain history, I needed to learn more, so two years later, I found myself on the Zoji La in the footsteps of Silk Road traders who, like us, hoped to make it to the historic trading hub of Kargil before nightfall.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe mountainous region of Ladakh is situated in the westernmost corner of the Himalayas amongst the disputed borders of India, Pakistan and China. Towering peaks, steep glacial valleys and sweeping alpine plateaus dominate the landscape. Fields of barley blanket sandy floodplains; blindingly white apple and apricot blossoms paint the shores along the Indus River; and on the ridges above, snow leopards and Himalayan brown bears move like wraiths as they search for their next meal. Because of its location at the crossroads of commerce and conquest, modern Ladakh is home to a blend of cultures including Tibetan Buddhists, Muslims and a number of tribal communities.\nThe Silk Road refers to one of the world's largest overland trade routes \u2013 a network that spanned 6,400km connecting Europe to far East Asia. Although named for the Chinese silks that the Roman elite imported during the 1st Century AD, the cross-continental trade system was established much earlier. Once constructed, the network helped transport ideas, religions, commodities and currencies across the ancient world. While the connection between Europe and East Asia was severed in 1453 when the Ottomans boycotted China, segments of the Silk Road continued to exist regionally in places like Ladakh well into the 20th Century.\nA few days after our hair-raising crossing of Zoji La, Hussain and I sat at a small cafe in central Kargil eating dal and sipping masala chai. As the Islamic call to prayer echoed around the mountains of the Zanskar Range and wood smoke drifted in from a nearby bakery, Hussain explain why his family decided to protect and share their great-grandfather's treasure.\nSilk Road Kargil\nThe best way to experience Kargil's Silk Road history is to drive there along the ancient route from Leh or Srinagar. In Kargil, hundreds of artefacts displayed at the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum provide a detailed history of the route's fabled past. Just outside of town, stone-carved Greco-Buddhist-style buddhas from to 5th Century showcase the region's past connections to Central Asia and Mediterranean. For an in depth experience, Roots Ladakh offers a 10-day Silk Road expedition that follows the fabled route from Srinagar to Leh via Zoji La and Kargil.\nAt first, Hussain's family was unsure of what to do with the ancient items. In 2002, Florida Atlantic University anthropologists Dr Jacqueline Fewkes and Nasir Khan heard rumours of the collection and travelled to meet Hussain and his relatives. Recognising the artefacts' importance, the anthropologists encouraged the family to preserve the items for future generations. With Hussain's two uncles serving as the director and curator, the family opened the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum in central Kargil where visitors can explore hundreds of Silk Road artefacts ranging from 18th-Century Ladakhi sheep-horn bows to 19th-Century Chinese copper water pipes. To Fewkes, it is the personal anecdotes and family connection to the collection that makes this museum unique and important.\n\"The Munshi Aziz Bhat [museum] doesn't have to, and should not, be the British Museum or the Smithsonian because it offers its own perspective that is invaluable to both local and global audiences,\" Dr Fewkes told me, \"The stories [here] are focused on identities that are significant to the descendants \u2026 family and local histories provide an alternative understanding about the past than national or international narratives that you would see in larger museums in India or abroad.\"\nWhile his uncles run the day-to-day operations at the museum, Hussain focuses on research and retracing his family history \u2013 a heritage he hopes can provide an opportunity to attract visitors and more importantly, help his community reconcile with a difficult past.\n\"I think it's very important that everybody try to preserve their own family histories,\" added Hussain's uncle, Ajaz Munshi. \"In the age of modernisation, we are often going away from our roots, and we must try to keep our legacies intact.\"\nBorn in Leh in 1866, Hussain's great-grandfather, Munshi Aziz Bhat, travelled to Kargil after finishing school in Skardu (modern-day Pakistan). At that time, Kargil was known as an important hub on the Treaty Road \u2013 a branch of the old Silk Road that connected China to Central Asia via Kashmir.\n\"Kargil has always been tied to many parts of the world,\" Hussain told me. \"Its name literally means 'a place to stop [between kingdoms]'.\" A successful accountant, Bhat moved to Kargil where he started a small trade outpost that, by 1920, had grown into seven shops, an inn for travellers and a stable for the many camels, horses and yaks used by long-distance traders who had travelled for up to three months from places like Lhasa or Yarkand. At its height, Bhat's hub housed traders and goods moving between Central Asia, mainland India, China, Europe and the Americas.\n\"I found it interesting to discover how truly globalised this area was during that time,\" Hussain said. \"This region was really cosmopolitan then.\"\nBut Bhat's business was not to last. In 1948 the borders between India and Pakistan closed when the countries were partitioned, essentially shuttering all long-distance trade in and out of Kargil. Bhat retired as one of the last-known traders along one of the final sections of the Silk Road to close, dying later that year. \"When my great-grandfather closed the building,\" Hussain said, \"the rooms remained under lock and key for almost half a century.\"\u00a0\nThe following day while hiking on a ridge above the Mushkoh Valley, Hussain and I passed rings of rocks and an occasional sandbag that remained from the Kargil war. Since the conflict ended, this area located just a few kilometers from the de facto border with Pakistan, retains a lingering reputation amongst Indians as being war-torn and dangerous.\n\"In Kargil and other places impacted by war, I think there is an identity crisis and lack of pride,\" Hussain explained. \"I think tourism is a great tool to help because when people from the outside come to your community and appreciate your heritage, history and culture, it can help your pride return.\"\nHussain and his brother Tafazzul launched Roots Ladakh in 2013, a travel company focusing on the natural and cultural heritage of Kargil. While most visitors to Ladakh stay near the capital Leh to see Buddhist monasteries and search for snow leopards, Hussain hopes to slowly invite more people to his home.\n\"Our vision is to change the preconceived notion about our region as a warzone through the lens of heritage,\" he explained, poking at a fresh snow leopard track in the mud. \"I reminisce a lot about my ancestors and the interesting people they must have met. Kargil today is a transit location, just like in the past, and I feel like I am continuing that legacy by hosting travellers and guests.\"\nFollowing the old Silk Road, Hussain and I snaked our way up the Suru Valley towards the isolated Buddhist kingdom of Zanskar. Turning a corner, I saw three elderly women walking beneath the tongue of a massive glacier, carrying large stacks of hay on their backs. They were preparing for winter while chatting and walking to their homes, which were several steep kilometers away. Hussain offered them and their goods a ride. As the women climbed in, one asked what news Hussain had from the outside world.\nJust as his great-grandparents had done, Hussain turned towards his multicultural band of weary travellers and began to relay stories of politics, trade and faraway lands.\u00a0\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Dutch linguist Leonie Cornips has become fascinated with how cows communicate. But can this really be called 'language'?\nLeonie Cornips was long overdue for her coffee break. The chilly autumn air made a hot drink feel enticing. But Cornips was busy. She was a couple of hours into her work with a small herd of dairy cows. If she left now, she would lose something that would take time to recover. Cornips and the herd had entered a delicate, shared space she calls \"the rhythm of the cow\".\u00a0\nCornips is a sociolinguist at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scholars who pass through the institute's ornate doorway usually specialise in the study of Dutch language and culture. The soft-spoken researcher earned her academic laurels in the 1990s, and she still studies variations in syntax between different dialects in the Netherlands. But in addition to this, Cornips' work has more recently taken what professionals in the field call \"the animal turn\".\nFor years, Cornips has spent her summer holidays on a farm. She was struck from the start by the different personalities of individual cows. She read an essay by a philosopher that asked why linguists never study animals. It affected her deeply. Cornips felt that cows had the intelligence and social habits to be good research subjects for a linguist. As a Dutch person, she also knew they were cultural icons in a nation with a passion for cheese. So she turned her professional skills to cows.\nHumans have assumed for centuries that the ability to use language is a measure of our superiority. There is even an academic term for it: \"logocentrism\", meaning those who use words (from the Greek logos, meaning \"word\" or \"reason\") occupy a privileged position. Language, say many linguists, is what makes us human. Animals may grunt, bark or chirp, but they do not possess anything that counts as language.\nCornips is using her work with dairy cows to push back on this idea. It extends half a century of effort that began with Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees and Roger Payne's recording of humpback whales in the 1960s in an effort to show that humans may not be as linguistically unique as we had assumed.\nMany of Cornips' colleagues were sceptical when she suggested they apply the framework of linguistics to animals.\n\"The problem is people have no clear idea about language,\" she says. \"When they talk about language, they always refer to what comes out of the mouth.\" But after spending six years thoroughly immersed in the lives of cows, Cornips thinks that language is better understood as \"distributed\" between the mouth, body and surroundings, making it embodied, multi-modal and sensory. \"I'm eating with the cows, touching, kissing, walking, hugging,\" she says.\nMost research on cow language tend to focus on sounds. A 2015 study in the Netherlands, for example, looked at the pitch of cow sounds to see if they correlated with behaviours and concluded this could be a way to determine their welfare. And a 2019 Australian study found cows not only have distinctive individual vocalisations, but maintain these distinctive calls across a variety of contexts.\nCornips and the farmers she recruits to assist her record the frequency, duration and intensity of the sounds cows make. But she also focusses on the other ways meaning is expressed among bovines. Her methods are often ethnographic, a way of studying cultures that relies strongly on observation by the researcher. Cornips carefully observes cow behaviours and interactions alongside sound to determine how they communicate. \"I notice with cows that the body is an instrument to get to know the other,\" she says. Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".\nCows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says. This became obvious with Piet, a young male Fleckvieh from an intensively managed indoor facility who Cornips brought to join five other cows in an outdoor pasture.\u00a0\n\"I was always so happy to see him, that when I got into his meadow, I walked straight towards him and tried to touch him immediately,\" Cornips says. When she did so, Piet would back away.\nCornips gradually came to understand the need to respect Piet's personal space, as she might with a fellow human. She learned to keep her arms by her sides and only use eye contact intermittently, taking turns with Piet to look at each other and then look away. \"It took me quite a while,\" she says. \"I was very stupid. They are teaching me how to connect to them.\" Cornips realised she had to learn an etiquette. Without patience and attention, she says, you would never see it.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The scientists learning to speak whale\n\u2022\u00a0The sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet' revealed by AI\n\u2022\u00a0Is there something special about the human voice?\nPatience also turns out to be crucial when cows communicate with each other. When a mother calls her calf, it sometimes takes 60 seconds for the calf to respond. The space between is filled with bodily gestures. Studies from Austria show that ear positioning and neck-stretching are integral to cow language. Humans think of the ability to wiggle our ears as a party trick. For a cow, it appears to be fundamental to communication. The first sentence in a conversation with a cow is likely to involve movement of the ears and a look.\u00a0\u00a0\nCows are not the only animals being studied for their complex modes of communication. Michelle Fournet, an assistant professor specialising in marine acoustic ecology at the University of New Hampshire in the US, has learned it is unhelpful to impose human expectations on species like whales and seals.\nAnimals use sound completely differently from how humans use it, she says. \"If we are to do a good job at understanding how animals are communicating and why they are communicating, it behoves us to adopt their perspective.\"\nFournet stops short of using the word \"language\" to describe the information transfer taking place between non-humans. But she has gained a deep appreciation for the subtleties of animal communication. Their system is not less than ours, Fournet says, but other. We do them a disservice by searching for similarities.\u00a0\nOne difference between humans and many animals is their use of the environment. Cornips has found cow communication leans on its surroundings more than ours. She observed one herd where individuals used their bodies to bang on an iron fence to communicate with the rest of the herd at feeding time, which she views as a type of language. She noticed cows responding to her differently depending on whether she entered a barn with solid walls or open sides: since cows on different farms are surrounded by different physical features, this offers distinctive opportunities for linguistic expression. Cows, she argues, develop diverse languaging practices \u2013 almost like dialects \u2013 where meaning depends on the shape of their surroundings.\nLike other domestic animals, cows face the additional challenge of interspecies communication with humans. \"Most farmers are not sensitive to the rhythm of the cow,\" says Cornips. \"The cows must obey the rhythm of the farmer.\" Dairy herds are constantly shunted between feeding, milking and grazing grounds. If a cow does not learn the daily routine or fails to be productive, it goes to the slaughterhouse. She is shocked by how readily people assume cows are stupid.\u00a0\n\"In becoming a dairy cow,\" she says, \"they must have very rich communicative skills because they have to understand what the farmer wants them to do\u2026 which is not easy.\"\nCornips has analysed recordings to show that cows will simplify their vocalisation once a farmer recognises their need. Rather than having their intelligence bred out of them to be more compliant, Cornips thinks domestic animals are forced to develop a fuller communication repertoire than wild animals.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf dairy cows have complex linguistic practices, it's tempting to ask how they stack up against the other great communicators in the animal kingdom. How would they compare, for example, to humpback whales? Cornips admires the complex vocalisations found in whale song. Humpbacks are among the cetaceans known to develop different dialects in different regions. They also communicate over vast distances. (Read more about the sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language which researchers are uncovering in whale communication).\nBut Cornips points out that whales lack some of the capacities of cows. A whale's ears are not as moveable as a cow's, she says. They also lack hooves. \"Whales cannot express themselves bodily very much,\" Cornips says. \"In that way they may be [less complex] than cows.\"\nFournet says she does not believe it makes sense to rank animal communication by its complexity. \"There isn't an answer to what you are looking for,\" she told me when I asked her to compare whales to cows.\nMany traditional linguists are still hesitant to ascribe language to non-humans. Leora Bar-el, a linguistics professor at the University of Montana in the US, is not hostile to the idea of animal language but thinks it worth asking what we gain and what we lose by expanding the definition of language to include cows.\n\"We may lose the fact there is something unique about human language,\" she says. For example, human language permits incredible creativity. Think of the works of Shakespeare. It can also refer to distant events and even reflect back on itself, as language does when it provides a definition.\nBut Eva Meijer, author of the essay that first inspired Cornips and the 2018 book Animal Languages, argues such claims can be self-fulfilling. \"What we see as language has been developed by excluding the language of other animals,\" she says. In fact, we define language in a way that makes it easy to deny it to others. Meijer points out the long history of human oppression associated with denying other people their language. She believes that recognising language in animals provides new tools for understanding them and perhaps even for learning how to inhabit the planet more sustainably.\nCornips, though, does not put an animal rights agenda at the centre of her work. She is focused primarily on expanding the field of linguistics. But the implications are hard to ignore. Cows may have more complex social lives than we thought. Her research reveals numerous additional avenues for exploration. How much does language contribute to distinctive bovine communities and cultures? What sort of planning can cows do with each other? Can they use language to pass on knowledge between generations?\nThe answers to these questions could change how we regard the lives of many animals. When 96% of the weight of mammals on earth is made up of humans and domesticated livestock, understanding better what cattle, sheep and chickens are communicating could lead to improved relationships with them, as well as better lives for animals.\u00a0\nCornips knows things are unlikely to change fast. Recently, though, she has noticed the idea that animals have language has become more common in academic journals.\nShe hopes linguistics can be a tool for unlocking different attitudes. \"My most important goal,\" she says, \"is to show others that you can look with different eyes at a domestic animal.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".Cows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says.",

        "article_text": "Swimming holidays are the ultimate in slow travel \u2013 and since the pandemic, they've become more popular than ever.\nThe pale-blue copper domes of the church of Our Lady of the Rock were easy to spot as we swam across the Bay of Kotor from the picturesque fishing village of Dra\u017ein Vrt. So too were shoals of Adriatic fish: sardines, mackerel and sprats, as well as sea anemones and urchins. The water was crystal clear and almost Caribbean blue; and when my head was not in the water, the landscape was panoramic mountains.\u00a0\nThis delightful experience was the first day of a swimming holiday in and around the Montenegro fjords. It was not a vacation that involved lying on a beach and taking the occasional dip in the sea, but one where we travelled by swimming in a group while a boat transported our gear from place to place. A swimming holiday is the ultimate in slow travel, moving through the water from island to island and cove to cove, stopping for lunch in a historic town or tiny fishing village before returning to the sea to meander further around the coastline.\u00a0\nFor a while, it seemed that no matter how far we swam, the church sitting in the middle of the bay on a rocky promontory was not getting any closer. The swim itself was rewarding, through clear, warm waters surrounded by jagged mountains, but the goal was the islet where, according to legend, local seamen found an icon of the Madonna and Child on a rock. They then swore that after each safe journey they would add another rock until the landmass gradually emerged from the sea, crowned by a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\nSuddenly it hove into near view and within minutes we were climbing out of the water, attracting strange glances from a wedding party gathered outside. The crew on our safety boat passed us towels and clothes, enabling us to cover up so we could enter and admire the ornately painted interior. Most people arrive by boat to this popular tourist destination, but swimming all the way there gave me some sense of the relief those fishermen must have felt when they returned home safely.\n\"Swimming gives you a unique eye-view on the world because you are seeing it from ground or sea level,\" says Ella Foote, editor of Outdoor Swimmer Magazine and author of the book How to Wild Swim. \"But it's also that so much of the world developed around a body of water. Most major towns and cities grew up around rivers or alongside the coast, especially when water was the main method of transportation. In the modern world we have lost what was an all-important connection with water and it's fascinating to rediscover it and approach a new place from the water that surrounds or runs through it.\"\u00a0\nOur group (we wonder, should the collective noun be \"a goggle\"?) was made up of 15 swimmers, drawn from around the globe and ranging in age from 20 to 60-something. In common was a love of swimming. though our abilities differed from reasonably competent pool swimmers to open water veterans and seasoned triathletes.\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWe were split into three groups of similar speeds (identifiable by different coloured swimming caps). Each group was shadowed by a small inflatable boat, while a bigger boat transported us and our gear to and from each swim, as well as providing a base for lunch, changing and anyone wanting a break. On average we swam around 5km a day; a challenging distance that requires stamina and strength, but knowing I could opt out and sit on the boat at any point somehow made that challenge easier.\nLeisure swimming has long been popular in the UK, from Britain's \"Lost King\", Prince Henry Frederick Stuart, the older brother of Charles I, who died after contracting typhoid swimming in the Thames, to the Victorians who made sea-bathing resorts fashionable. But perhaps the greatest swimming \"pioneer\" was the romantic poet Lord Byron.\nIn 1820, a 22-year-old Byron swam across the Hellespont, a tumultuous four-mile strait in Turkey now called the Dardanelles. The swim from Troy in Greece to Gallipoli connects Europe with Asia and was famous in Greek mythology for Leander's nightly swims to meet his lover.\n\"I'd read Byron's accounts of his travels and the Hellespont swim and decided that's what I wanted to do for my 30th birthday,\" said Simon Murie, the founder of the world's first ever swimming holiday business, SwimTrek.\n\"I found that the hardest part was not the swim itself but getting the necessary permissions, working out the route and finding a boat to accompany me. I realised I could not be the only swimmer wanting to swim from place to place but suspected many were put off by the organisation and so I decided to set up a business that would do all that, leaving swimmers to train and turn up.\"\nAnd so, 21 years ago, SwimTrek, based on the UK south coast in Brighton, was launched to mixed reactions.\n\"Our first-ever trip was swimming from island to island in the Greek Cyclades. I had done all the preparation and booked accommodation, but on our first night, the hotel owner had given all our rooms away. She could not grasp the concept that we would actually be swimming there!\"\nThe mistake was remedied, and since then SwimTrek has expanded its operations from taking 100 swimmers to four locations in that first year to more than 3,000 travellers to 40 destinations around the world in 2024. Other companies have subsequently entered the market. Some offer a similar range of trips and destinations, while others, like The Big Blue Swim, specialise in a handful of Greek Islands.\nMy trip to Montenegro was with Strel Swimming, which operates mainly in and around the Mediterranean. Established in 2010 by father and son Martin and Borut Strel, the company built on experience garnered surrounding Martin's epic marathon swims.\n\"Martin was the first person to ever swim the entire length of the Amazon River, and I worked with him as a guide and expedition leader on this and his Yangtze, Mississippi, Danube and Parana river swims,\" says Borut. \"With all our knowledge and expertise, it made sense to open our own business. We started in Croatia and Slovenia in 2010, adding new trips and locations year on year.\u00a0Swimming is a low-impact activity on the environment, and since we use local hotels, restaurants, boats and guides, our groups contribute to the local economy.\"\nOn the third day of our trip, we swam around Mamula Island, home to an impressive Austro-Hungarian fortress built to guard the entrance to Kotor Bay. In World War Two it was used as a concentration camp.\u00a0\n\"I'll probably always remember that island, along with the waves and currents that changed as we swam around it, and I doubt that'd be true if I'd only seen it from the boat,\" said Nancy Meade, an attorney form Anchorage, Alaska. This was the second time she had come to explore Europe from the water. \"The special thing about a swimming holiday is that it combines being active and outdoors all day long with a great chance to explore in a unique way. Most tourists can walk out to the seashore, and maybe even take a boat tour or cruise, but actually spending the day on and in the water and seeing the many small towns from the water is very special. Being at eye level with the shore and rocks makes you feel a part of the place much more than if you just spent a week on a boat looking around.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Cheese, beer and a wonderful view\n\u2022\u00a0Why wild swimming is Britain's new craze\n\u2022\u00a0The River Waveney: The 'secret' UK waterway most Brits don't know\nThe rise of the swimming holiday goes hand in hand with an increase in outdoor and open water swimming generally. In the UK, this took place after the 2012 London Olympics, which featured the first open water-swimming event. Globally, wild swimming saw another boost during the pandemic, when most indoor sport was banned.\nNaturally, as with any sporting holiday, there are risks \u00ad\u2013 and safeguards against them. Trained guides check locations before swims and routes are amended if the weather or water conditions are unsuitable. Safety briefings are given at the start of each swim, and guides help and encourage less confident swimmers to get the most out of their trip.\u00a0\n\"Each trip has something special about it,\" says Marlys Cappaert who has worked as a SwimTrek guide for 10 years. \"I really like those moments when someone overcomes a fear or tries a swim that they didn't think they could do. The joy when they succeed is giddy. And it can become quite emotional, too. In my first year, at the end of a week, one lady came to me sobbing. She shared with me that six months earlier she had received a challenging medical diagnosis and was unsure if she'd even be well enough to make our trip, let alone complete the swims. But she had. By that point, the whole group was sobbing.\"\nOn our final day, we made our way along the coast of the Lu\u0161tica peninsula and swam into a former submarine tunnel where the Yugoslavian Navy once hid their underwater vessels, ready to emerge in the event of attack. It was eerily cold and dark inside and we were glad to emerge into daylight and head further down to the coast to the crystal-clear waters of the Blue Cave. Inside the grotto, sunlight reflected off the white-sand seabed and rendered the waters a shimmering turquoise. A few motorboats with tourists taking photos hovered near the mouth of the cave as we swam deep inside relishing the unique experience our mode of travel afforded us.\u00a0\nAs the great swimmer Lord Byron wrote in his poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimate:\n'There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,\nThere is a rapture on the lonely shore,\nThere is society where none intrudes\nBy the deep Sea, and music in its roar'\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

The Canadian Centre for Child Protection \u2013 one of those Franaszek alerted \u2013 says it found at least 35 images flagged by Adalytics on the site that meet its classification of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The Centre says it notified ImgBB, and the images were taken down. An FBI spokesperson says the bureau reviews all allegations of criminal conduct but does not comment on tips from the public. The DHS did not respond to questions.\nThe more Franaszek dug, the clearer the problem became \u2013 and his findings raise questions about how the adverts you see online may also be inadvertently pumping large sums of money into undesirable, and at times illegal, corners of the internet.\nAccording to a new report from Adalytics, advertising systems run by companies including Google, Amazon and Microsoft have inadvertently funnelled money to the owners of a website hosting illegal images of child sex abuse. In addition to CSAM, Adalytics documented ads for more than 70 large organisations and Fortune 500 companies running alongside hardcore adult pornography, including MasterCard, Nestl\u00e9, Starbucks, Unilever and even the US Government. \"Many advertisers whose ads appeared on this website probably had no idea that they were funding this kind of content,\" Franaszek says.\nOn 7 February 2025, US Senators Marsha Blackburn and Richard Blumenthal sent letters to Amazon, Google and other ad tech companies mentioned in the report, demanding answers about whether this problem represents a widespread issue across the internet. \"The dissemination of [child sexual abuse material] is a heinous crime that inflicts irreparable harm on its victims,\" the letter to Google reads. \"Where digital advertiser networks like Google place advertisements on websites that are known to host such activity, they have, in effect, created a funding stream that perpetuates criminal operations and irreparable harm to our children.\"\nWhile a few images of child abuse on a single website have alarmed many both inside and outside the industry, they also provide a glimpse of some of the wider problems afflicting the inscrutable world of digital advertising. Most people who use the internet will be familiar with the clamour of digital ads fighting for their attention. They are the product of a system so vast and complex that even the companies who run it don't always know where their money is going. For years, critics have warned that the tech industry will unwittingly line the pockets of bad actors across the web without serious regulatory oversight. Lawmakers are still catching up.\nMeanwhile, it is relatively easy for anyone to set up a website that can make money from ad networks. \"It doesn't cost much to operate a website that serves a few million images per month,\" Franaszek says.\u00a0\nGoogle, Amazon and Microsoft insist they are committed to fighting online child sexual exploitation and abuse. All three companies say they have now banned ImgBB and its subsidiary site IBB from their advertising systems.\n\"We have zero tolerance when it comes to content\u00a0promoting\u00a0child sexual abuse and exploitation and both of the accounts in question are terminated,\" a Google spokesperson told the BBC. \"Our teams are constantly monitoring Google\u2019s publisher network for this type of content and we refer information to the appropriate authorities.\"\nAds are the fuel that powers the internet.\u00a0The best estimates say\u00a0spending\u00a0on digital advertising reached an all-time high of $694bn (\u00a3559bn) in 2024. The marketing industry brings in untold sums for its clients, and the majority of ads are served on legal, appropriate sites. Sometimes, advertisers have a direct relationship with the platforms that run their adverts and commercials. But most of the time, the process is far more complex.\nAlmost every time you see an ad online, it's the result of a chain of dozens of platforms and services \u2013 some competing, others working together \u2013 in an automated process that plays out in fractions of a second. Advertisers usually don't pick the websites that show their ads. Instead, advertisers pay an \"ad network\" whose business is to find the most suitable audience on the most suitable site.\nAmazon, Google and Microsoft all run ad networks of their own, but Google's are the largest by far. It's so dominant, in fact, that the company is currently fighting allegations of operating an illegal monopoly. Google disputes this and argues it faces steep competition in the digital advertising business.\nThese ad networks have untold millions of websites in their inventories. When a network serves an ad, the website gets paid. But anyone can plug their website into the ad networks and start making money. That means it's up to Google and other tech companies to do their due diligence to ensure they don't run ads on websites that fund criminal enterprises or damage brands' reputations.\nBut research by Adalytics and others suggests Google and the ad tech industry have sent advertising money from clients including US senators and multinational corporations to a long list of questionable websites, in ad campaigns that add up to tens of billions of dollars, and perhaps even more. The list includes websites featuring foreign propaganda, calls for racial violence, extremist political content and pornography, as well as sites based in countries facing US trade sanctions such as Iran, Syria and Russia.\nAccording to Arielle Garcia, chief operating officer at the digital advertising watchdog group Check My Ads, incidents like this expose one of the key problems with digital advertising \u2013 that the systems running these adverts are so impenetrably complicated that it's difficult for anyone to figure out what's actually going on, especially from the outside.\n\"That isn't a mistake, it's intentionally opaque,\" she says. \"The ad tech industry weaponises complexity.\" A growing chorus of advertisers complain that the big players in the ad tech business have been providing them with less and less information, Garcia says, and that lack of transparency makes it hard to detect waste and bad practices.\nA Google spokesperson says the company has strict policies about what type of content can run adverts, and it uses \"cutting edge AI-driven enforcement systems\" as well as teams of human reviewers to enforce those policies at scale. The spokesperson says Google disables ads from running on sites where such content is detected.\nBut examples like those exposed by Adalytics have raised doubts among the companies who pay for the adverts in the first place.\u00a0\n\"We have no idea where our ads are going. No confidence at all,\" says a media executive at a major consumer healthcare company whose ads appeared on ImgBB via Google and Amazon's ad network. The executive asked for anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the matter. \"Amazon and Google are responsible for what sits within their inventory. You would think removing content like this from the supply path would be the number one priority.\"\nA Starbucks spokesperson says the company has a robust approach to ensure that its ads run on sites that align with its social responsibility standards. They say Starbucks ensures that its media partners undergo bi-annual audits. A Unilever spokesperson says the company uses similar guidelines and standards and plans to investigate the report's findings. MasterCard and\u00a0Nestl\u00e9 did not respond to requests for comment.\n\"We regret that this occurred and have swiftly taken action to block these websites from\u00a0showing\u00a0our\u00a0ads,\" an Amazon spokesperson says. \"We have strict policies in place against serving ads on content of this\u00a0nature,\u00a0and we are taking additional steps to help ensure this does not happen in the future.\u201d A Microsoft spokesperson says the company doesn't allow advertising on content that violates its policies, which includes user-generated content that is not sufficiently regulated or moderated. The company says it takes immediate action when it detects violations.\nGoogle, Amazon and Microsoft are not the only companies that served ads on ImgBB. Adalytics found ad networks run by a list of other, smaller companies that ran ads on the site as well.\nHowever, Google's dominance over the ad industry means it should share an outsized proportion of the blame, says Laura Edelson, a computer science professor who studies the digital economy at Northeastern University in the US.\u00a0\n\"No one is more responsible for this than Google,\" she says. \"Sure, this stuff might be hard to fix. That's why Google gets paid so much money. This is merely an engineering problem \u2013 the kind of problem they solve every day. Google should be held accountable. This is harming our society.\" ImgBB may also be an example of a much larger problem, Edelson says. \"It is very unlikely that there's nothing else like this that's [able to] monetise in the same way.\"\nAd industry insiders and child safety experts say a site like ImgBB should have been blocked from advertising systems far in advance.\u00a0\nImgBB lets people upload photos anonymously, without creating an account, and provides settings that hide images from search engines \u2013 features that are perfect for criminal activity, experts say. Details about ImgBB's ownership have been scrubbed from public website registries, and that information is absent from the website's terms of service and privacy policy, contrary to standard practices. ImgBB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"Anyone who spent any time looking at this site would have eliminated it [from their ad network inventories],\" says Rob Leathern, a former executive at both Google and Meta who worked on advertising safety issues. \"The mechanics of [ImgBB] mean that a greater level of diligence and care should have been taken by a variety of players in the ecosystem. It's 2025. This is not a new industry. These things shouldn't be getting through.\"\nThis isn't ImgBB's first brush with hosting depictions of sexual abuse. Since 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) sent ImgBB 27 notifications about child sexual abuse material on the platform. That number may be higher, as the 2024 data hasn't been released yet. NCMEC says the website removed the content in every case. \"NCMEC would not qualify this hosting provider as a significant CSAM issue based on this data point alone,\" says John Sheehan, who oversees NCMEC's operations relating to sexual crimes against children. However, \"any platform that allows individuals to anonymously upload images and videos will have a high likelihood for potential for abuse\", he says.\n\"It's a shady platform,\" says Josh Golin, executive director of the children's advocacy group Fairplay. \"This website is clearly designed to facilitate bad things. It's crazy to learn that there are ad placements happening on this website in the first place.\"\u00a0\nAmazon, Google and other ad tech companies could have used any number of methods to root out ImgBB from their inventories, according to Garcia of Check My Ads. Text analysis would have flagged descriptions of adult pornography on a page. Algorithms trained to spot child sex abuse material can identify illegal content. A manual review of ImgBB's features might also have revealed potential risks. Alternatively, Google and other companies could just dedicate an extra layer of diligence to reviewing websites that show up on NCMEC's disclosure reports, Garcia says.\nGoogle and Amazon did not answer questions about whether they use any of these specific methods to vet the websites in their systems.\nIt's no surprise that sites like ImgBB are slipping through, according to Matt Stoller, who's written extensively about the tech industry in his role as director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, which opposes corporate monopolies. The more resources ad networks spend making sure adverts only end up next to reputable content, the lower their margins will be, he says.\nStoller doesn't mince words. \"We shouldn't be asking about how we prevent this. We should be asking who is going to be held accountable. We're not just looking at an ad tech system, we're looking at a crime scene. The way to fix this is handcuffs,\" he says. \"Someone at Google should go to jail. Someone at Amazon should go to jail.\"\nIn addition to images of child sexual abuse on ImgBB, Adalytics says it found depictions of bestiality, other potentially illegal material and mountains of graphic adult pornography. Its report documented hundreds of examples of ads for multinational corporations and even the US government running alongside this type of content. The BBC independently verified a sample of Adalytic's findings, and observed ads for Fortune 500 companies running alongside adult pornography on ImgBB. The BBC did not review any child abuse material or other illegal content.\u00a0\nGoogle isn't the only company drawing criticism. The BBC spoke to nearly a dozen marketers and advertising experts. Every one of them pointed to what they see as failings within the \"brand safety\" industry.\nBrand safety is the industry term used to describe keeping ads away from content that can damage a company's reputation. For many advertisers, showing up on a site like ImgBB is the worst-case scenario.\nFor extra assurance, some advertisers hire companies who make brand safety their entire business. The leaders in this industry, DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science (IAS), say they use a host of artificial intelligence tools and other methods to ensure their clients' ads don't show up on the wrong sites. DoubleVerify, for example, says it uses computer vision algorithms and other tools to analyse the images, video, audio and text on a web page. \"This meticulous visual analysis helps ensure that the visual components surrounding your ads are both suitable and consistent with your brand\u2019s message,\" according to DoubleVerify's website.\nHowever, the Adalytics report and other investigations like it suggest these brand safety systems are not working.\u00a0Computer vision software is highly effective at identifying naked bodies, for example, and a simple keyword search would have flagged that the pages spotted by Adalytics contained adult pornography. Yet advertising executives at companies whose ads appeared on ImgBB claimed to the BBC that both DoubleVerify and IAS marked ImgBB as \"100% safe\", including pages full of adult content.\u00a0\n\"If people are putting their trust in these [brand safety] vendors, then they should be reconsidering it, because it clearly isn't working,\" Leathern says.\u00a0\n\u201cIAS has zero tolerance for any illegal activity, and we strongly condemn any conduct related to child sexual abuse material,\u201d an IAS spokesperson says. \u201cWe are reviewing the allegations and remain focused on ensuring media safety for all of our customers.\u201d The company published a blogpost detailing its plans to \"re-assess our classifications for image-hosting sites\".\nA DoubleVerify spokesperson says the company blocked tens of thousands of ads from appearing on ImgBB in the past 30 days. Ad impressions on ImgBB account for only 0.000047% of the total ads they measured during that period, the spokesperson says, and over 80% of those ads were served on the homepage. The company published a blogpost breaking down other criticisms of the report.\nBoth IAS and DoubleVerify did not answer questions on the record about their methodology, or why advertisers saw pages with adult pornography marked as safe.\nOther industries have laws that require the kind of review process that might have flagged ImgBB. The finance and legal industries, among others, have so-called Know Your Customer laws, for example. Banks are required to scrutinise potential clients to ensure they aren't facilitating money laundering, terrorism, or other crimes. No such laws exist for digital advertising. In fact, the industry is almost entirely unregulated in the US and many other parts of the world.\n\"Our experience has been that the tech industry in general has failed to take meaningful action,\" says Jacques Marcoux, director of research and analytics at the Canadian\u00a0Centre for Child Protection. \"For this reason, our organisation, along with many others across the world, have been advocating for government regulation.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok: What happens when a social media app is banned\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0How America's porn wars could change your internet\nAddressing these issues requires a layered approach that involves every stakeholder in the digital supply chain, Marcoux says. Ad networks who onboard websites should engage in much more robust review processes; advertisers should demand accountability to ensure their ads don't appear next to harmful or illegal content; and the payment processors who handle transactions and compensation along the ad tech chain should apply more rigorous conditions and Know Your Customer practices as well, Marcoux says.\n\"We are not going to fix this problem without better regulation and actual, real, serious consequences for delivering ads that fund horrific companies and activities,\" Edelson says. \"It's too profitable to just ignore this. It's going to be impossible to solve without changing those incentives.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "When a prominent Saudi trans woman posted her suicide note on X, her friends and followers were devastated. The note, viewed by millions, said a lawyer in the US - where she had been trying to claim asylum - had persuaded her into returning home to a family and country that would not accept her identity.\nThe BBC World Service has identified this man as Bader Alomair, who has worked at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, evidence suggests. He is linked to controversial returns from the United States of several other Saudi students - including two later accused of committing murder during their time at university.\nMr Alomair has not responded to the allegations raised in our investigation.\nEden Knight was from one of the Middle Eastern kingdom's most respected families. After moving to Virginia in 2019 on a Saudi government scholarship to study at George Mason University, Eden made the decision in early 2022 to transition from presenting as a man to presenting as a woman, by wearing feminine clothes and taking female sex hormones.\nEden found a community on X and Discord where she felt accepted and started to grow a following online. In one post, she shared a picture of her Saudi ID photo next to her new feminine look and the post went viral.\nBeing transgender in Saudi Arabia is not tolerated by either society or the government - we have spoken to several transgender Saudis, now living outside the kingdom, who told us about the harassment, and in some cases violence, they had experienced.\nReturning to Saudi Arabia could therefore have been difficult for Eden. We understand her student visa expired at around the time of her viral tweet so she decided to seek asylum in the US in order to stay there permanently.\nEden said she was messaged by an old friend who put her in contact with an American private investigator Michael Pocalyko. He offered to help with her asylum claim, and mend the relationship with her family - according to another friend, Hayden, who Eden was living with in Georgia at the time.\nOther friends have shared messages with us from Eden, which say Mr Pocalyko told her she needed to move from Georgia to Washington DC in order to lodge her claim.\nAccording to the final message she posted on X, in late October 2022, the private investigator met Eden off the train in the US capital. He was accompanied by a Saudi lawyer named Bader, she wrote.\n\"I genuinely was optimistic and believed this could work,\" Eden said in her final post. She said Bader put her up in a nice apartment near Washington DC and took her sightseeing.\nBut over time it seems she began to question his motives. Eden wrote to friends, in messages shared with the BBC, that Bader was \"detransitioning\" her. She told them that Bader tried to throw out all of her feminine clothing and told her to stop hormone therapy.\nEden also told friends that Bader advised her she could not apply for asylum in the US and that she must return to Saudi Arabia to do this. A US immigration expert said such advice would be incorrect.\nIn December 2022, Eden messaged friends to say: \"I am going [back to Saudi] with a lawyer and wishing for the best.\" Her suicide note on X makes clear that the lawyer in question was someone called \"Bader\".\nIt was not long before Eden was telling friends that returning was a mistake.\nShe messaged them to say her parents had taken her passport and the government had instructed her to close her X account. Eden told friends she had evidence her parents had hired people to get her back to Saudi Arabia, though she never shared that evidence.\n\"The lawyer that was helping me with asylum was working with my parents behind my back,\" she told one of them.\nOver the next few months, Eden's friends say, she lost any hope of escaping Saudi Arabia.\nShe worked in a junior position at a tech company and in public assumed her original male identity. Eden messaged a friend to say she was trying to continue taking female hormones, but that her parents repeatedly confiscated them. Eden told friends that she suffered constant verbal abuse, and sent the friends a video - which we have seen - that she secretly recorded of a family member shouting that she had been brainwashed by Western ideas.\nEden took her own life on 12 March 2023.\nWe wanted to find \"Bader\" - the lawyer who Eden accused of detransitioning her and persuading her home, to ask him more about the events running up to her death. \nWe searched for lawyers of that name in the DC area, and one came up: Bader Alomair. There was limited information about him online, but an outdated directory for professionals working in Riyadh gave his full name in Arabic - which in turn led us to an inactive Facebook account showing a photo of him at Harvard Law School.\nIn texts Eden sent to friends, she mentioned her lawyer had been Harvard-educated.\nThen, a source shared a crucial photo - taken by Eden from the apartment Mr Alomair had installed her in. We were able to geolocate it to a residential block on the outskirts of Washington DC.\nOne person there told us he had known Eden and had seen her with Mr Alomair.\nHe said Eden owned feminine clothing, jewellery and make-up, but would have to hide it when Mr Alomair came over. He made her cut her hair and told her not to shave, the witness said.\nWe repeatedly tried to contact Mr Alomair, but he did not respond.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nLevel of abuse in the English game has reached 'crisis point' - Kick It Out\nThe level of abuse in English football has \"reached crisis point\", says the head of anti-discrimination body Kick It Out.\nThe comments come after Manchester City's Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw became the latest player to be subjected to racist and misogynistic messages, following a recent Women's Super League match.\nShaw pulled out of her club's League Cup semi-final to protect her mental health stemming from what Manchester City described as \"disgusting treatment\" after a defeat by Arsenal.\n\"It is absolutely shocking, and that's just one of a number of examples we see both online and in stadiums,\" said Kick It Out (KIO) chief executive Samuel Okafor.\n\"We're seeing those reports coming into us every single week.\"\nNewcastle United recently urged social media companies to do more after midfielder Joe Willock received \"appalling\" racist abuse on Instagram.\nTamworth forward Chris Wreh was also racially abused online last month.\nHowever, Okafor hopes new online safety rules will help to tackle the issue in what he sees as \"a pivotal year for driving real change across the game\", in terms of both discrimination and under-representation.\nThe Football Governance Bill - which will force clubs to show what action they are taking on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) - is expected to come into law in the next few months.\nThe Football Association has also made it mandatory for clubs to publish workforce data for the first time this summer, \"a really big step towards transparency in the game,\" according to Okafor.\n\"If football can really use this moment, it can change,\" he added. \"It's a huge opportunity to make it a more welcoming and inclusive place where people can feel that they can belong and thrive.\"\nPolice contacted as Willock faces 'appalling' racist abuse\nShaw misses League Cup semi-final after abuse\nTamworth's Wreh refuses to play over reaction to racism\nKhadija Shaw joined Manchester City in 2021 from Bordeaux\nKIO received a record number of reports of discrimination in a single season for 2023-24, with levels of sexism, misogyny and racism all on the rise.\nAcross all levels of English football, there were 1,332 incidents reported by the organisation - a 32% increase. Racism remained the most reported form of discrimination, with a 47% rise in abuse across all levels.\n\"These are footballers, but they're [also] real human beings, and when you see the abuse that they face, it's just totally unacceptable,\" said Okafor.\n\"We did a research with 1,500 women fans, and one in four still feel unsafe going to games. 52% said they experienced sexism within a stadium. So there's still a huge amount of cultural work to do to make the game more inclusive.\n\"People are feeling more freedom to share their toxic and discriminatory abuse online, in particular.\"\nBut rules in the 2023 Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show they are removing illegal content, with the platforms given until March to implement measures or face fines.\n\"We believe that's going to give the regulator more powers to be able to hold the social media firms to account, as well as providing better user-empowerment tools,\" said Okafor.\n\"This is really important, because you can see the impact it has. So this is a real opportunity to tackle that. It can be a real game changer.\"\nTech giant Meta recently announced it is abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram, to the dismay of campaigners against hate speech online.\n\"That really does trouble me,\" said Okafor. \"That really does make the job harder.\n\"And that's why we need the regulators to use their powers to really hold social media firms to account, and to issue those penalties.\"\nIn 2020, the FA launched a voluntary Diversity Code in a bid to tackle racial inequality in the English game.\nHowever, only 53 clubs signed up to provide data on their workforce annually, and collectively they failed to meet any of the eight recruitment targets.\nHaving admitted that progress had been \"slower than hoped\", the FA has made it mandatory for all professional clubs in the English game to provide full diversity workforce data on age, sex, gender, ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation within their organisation by June.\n\"We've been calling for this for a number of years,\" said Okafor.\n\"It may feel uncomfortable, but other industries do this on a regular basis, so it's football just trying to catch up to where it should be in terms of bringing the data into the light.\n\"The more crucial step is what happens when the data comes out.\n\"I'm really interested in seeing - do clubs reflect their communities? If they don't, there's an opportunity to ensure that they've got the relevant plans.\n\"What you can see there is clearly a lack of black coaches, of South Asian representation within football. There is a lack of diversity when it comes to match officials, in terms of boardrooms.\"\nOkafor says clubs should face fines if they fail to publish the data.\n\"We're very hopeful that all the clubs will have published their data,\" he added.\n\"And if not, then we'll be expecting that there should be a level of consequence as a result.\n\"This is certainly not about league tables or naming and shaming clubs. This really does drive the long-term sustainability of football.\"",

        "article_text": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music \u2013 with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.\nIf asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The radical trend millennials love\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forgotten Soviet genius of music\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?\nThere are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and \u2013 just as vitally \u2013 new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.\nUnsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag \"classictok\" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.\nFor French violinist Esther Abrami \u2013 who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards \u2013 the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. \"I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,\" Abrami tells BBC Culture.\nShe noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. \"I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,\" she enthuses. \"It opened this door to a completely new world.\"\nNigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fan Babatunde Akinboboye enjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. \"I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,\" he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. \"But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,\" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of \"hip-hopera\" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.\nBoth Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. \"I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,\" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts \u2013 taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery \u00a0\u2013 have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. \"It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,\" he explains. \"Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.\"\n'Complex and profound'\nAbrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: \"I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.\"\n\u00a0\nBritish concert pianist Harriet Stubbs is another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple 20-minute concerts from her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. \"I gave 250 concerts,\" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. \"I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.\"\nThe fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. \"I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,\" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a \"Bowie meets Rachmaninoff\" affair.\nInterestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia \u2013 dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery \u2013 both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub J\u00f3zef Orli\u0144ski, meanwhile, uses atmospheric visuals as a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, which The New York Times describes as \"resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos\".\n\"I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums \u2013 the narrative, the photography, the videos,\" Orli\u0144ski tells BBC Culture. \"I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,\" he adds. This is certainly something Orli\u0144ski has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, he wowed critics with his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was \"an incredible experience\" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. \"Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul \u2013 a pop song won't work.\"\nClassical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK's National Youth Orchestra have just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of \"the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager\".\nOrli\u0144ski agrees that classical music has achieved an \"almost hipstery\" status of late. \"It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,\" he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as \"people like Yuja Wang\" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. \"We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward.\" Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. \"I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,\" he concludes. \"[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing. And it'll work out, because audiences are ready.\"\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "As the Oscars approach, Kate Young \u2013 the stylist who dresses Scarlett Johansson, Dakota Johnson, Margot Robbie and others \u2013 talks risk taking, intimacy, and why method dressing drives her \"nuts\".\nOn any given Oscar Sunday, Kate Young is sipping black coffee while perched in a movie star's bedroom. \"If the ceremony starts at 8pm, we're there in the morning,\" says the celebrity stylist, who has dressed Scarlett Johansson, Dakota Johnson, Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez for some of their most iconic red-carpet arrivals. \"We try on the dress one last time before the hair-and-makeup team begins their work,\" she explains. \"But also, I'm kind of a nerd about the Oscars. I treat them like a final exam.\"\nYoung's academic roots go deep. After graduating from high school in Pennsylvania, she studied English and Art History at Oxford University. \"They had us write papers once a week, and then defend our arguments in front of the whole class. What great training to stand in front of a movie studio and explain why their biggest, most bankable star should wear something that might be a little risky!\"\u00a0\nThose risks \u2013 like the canary-yellow Vera Wang gown she chose for Michelle Williams at her first Academy Award ceremony in 2006 \u2013 have helped propel Young to the status of a Hollywood fashion guru. Today she is among the most influential people in fashion.\nAfter university, Young got a job as the personal assistant of Lynne Franks, the UK fashion publicist and one of the founders of London Fashion Week. A neighbour from childhood then set her up with an interview at Cond\u00e9 Nast, the parent company of Vogue. \"Anna Wintour needed an assistant, but pretty soon, it became clear I should be working in The Closet,\" says Young, referring to Vogue's legendary walk-in wardrobe. \"Back then, models were on the cover of Vogue, and celebrities were kind of an afterthought.\" When an up-and-coming actress had a small story in the magazine, she would volunteer to dress them.\n\"There's a real disconnect between high fashion and what people actually wear. Celebrities are the first place that most people see designer fashion. But they still have to be human beings \u2013 I mean, can they sit down in a couture evening gown? Can they walk in a pair of designer shoes without someone holding their hand? If not, then I'm not interested, no matter how famous the brand is.\"\nAfter shoots with then-emerging stars like Sienna Miller and Katie Holmes, Young would often field requests from Hollywood publicists \u2013 or sometimes the actresses themselves \u2013 for a last-minute gown. \"They'd be like, 'Shoot, I have this party, can I borrow a designer dress? Can you help?' But I still never thought it could be a career.\"\u00a0\nYoung considers the vivid yellow gown that Williams wore when she was nominated for a best actress Oscar for Brokeback Mountain as an early professional coup. \"It was her first nomination, and there was a lot of excitement. So we created this very sparkly moment, especially with the jewellery. Because of its colour, that dress was almost a spotlight in itself, and that was very intentional. We wanted people to keep wanting to look at her. That's the job of a star.\"\nThe Changing Room\nThe Changing Room\u00a0is a column from the BBC that spotlights the fashion and style innovators on the frontlines of a progressive evolution.\nAs Young became a go-to fashion advisor for Hollywood ingenues, television shows like America's Next Top Model and films like The Devil Wears Prada turned the once-insular fashion industry into entertainment for millions, and stylist Rachel Zoe landed her own reality TV show. Still, \"being a 'stylist' wasn't considered prestigious in the fashion world,\" Young insists. \"It wasn't until Instagram started that I realised I should be speaking up more about my work.\"\nWhen Instagram launched in 2010, it quickly became a tool for celebrities to wrest control of their image from tabloids and studios alike. \"They didn't have to wait around for a magazine to photograph them in a certain way,\" says Young. \"They could do that on their own. And I realised, I could do that on my own, too.\"\u00a0\nShe began posting images of her red-carpet work for celebrities including Natalie Portman and Isabella Rossellini, alongside more traditional ad campaigns for luxury titans like Dior. \"Suddenly at Paris Fashion Week, people are coming up to me to say 'Congratulations!'\" says Young, laughing. \"Congratulations for what? Admitting what I do for work?\"\u00a0\nYoung's entrance into social media happened just as major luxury brands were making their clothes available through online shopping sites like Net-a-Porter and MyTheresa. \"Suddenly, you could see the red carpet from your phone, and then you could buy the same dress as a celebrity, sometimes instantly,\" says Elana Fishman, the editor of the Hollywood fashion hub Page Six Style, which keeps close tabs on red-carpet trend cycles. \"For a stylist as influential as Kate Young, that means you're directly impacting what people are buying, all by picking out someone's outfit as they walk to Starbucks.\"\nLast summer, the actress Sophie Turner \u2013 a client of Young's \u2013 began pairing her Louis Vuitton purse with $200 baggy, pale-blue striped pyjama bottoms from Woera, an independent, female-led clothing brand in Athens. According to Woera founder Natalia Georgala, the trousers sold out \"very fast\". In September, similar styles appeared on the runways at Alberta Ferretti and Burberry. Fishman describes this as\u00a0 as Young's \"ripple effect\" on fashion.\nAs Young gears up for another red-carpet season \u2013 her current roster of clients includes Turner along with Julianne Moore, Scarlett Johansson and Dakota Johnson \u2013 she says that studios now invest a considerable amount of money to ensure their stars stay top-of-mind on Instagram and TikTok, which often involves them wearing talked-about outfits.\nA recent trend, nicknamed \"method dressing\", involves celebrities evoking their characters at film premieres and press junkets. (See the Wicked promotional tour, with Ariana Grande styled by Mimi Cuttrell in pink poufs, and Cynthia Erivo in witchy green gowns chosen by stylist Jason Bolden.)\u00a0\"The studios are driving that trend,\" says Young, \"because the fashion becomes an extension of the movie marketing\". Young points to the success of Barbie and its all-pink-everything screenings as the most famous example. \"I understand the impulse behind it, but it drives me nuts,\" she admits. \"Like, I'm sorry, but Dakota Johnson is not going to wear a spider print every time she talks about Madame Web.\"\nInstead of bugging out on insect fashion, Young prefers to feature work by as many independent brands as possible, mixing usual style suspects like Gucci and Chanel with made-in-New-York dresses by Jamaican British designer Carly Cushnie, jeans from the teeny vintage dealer Still Here, and\u00a0jewellery that she co-creates with designer Monica Vikander, as seen on Jennifer Lawrence and Christy Turlington.\u00a0\n\"You want to lend your platform to new talent, to small businesses, to people working with recycled fabric,\" she says. \"But it has to look amazing, too. I do a lot of research to find clothes that check both boxes.\"\u00a0\nIt is time for Young to head to a photo shoot. As we say goodbye, I ask if she has advice for those wanting to enter Hollywood's fashion machine. \"I mean, be kind. Work is so much better when you have friends,\" she says. \"On a practical level, you're going to be seeing your clients naked every day. You'll know when they're sick or pregnant, or trying to get pregnant. It's very intimate. It makes you very close to people very quickly.\"\nYoung says she wishes someone told her how emotional the process of styling an actress could become. \"It's not something you can study or prepare for;\" she says. \"It's just what happens when someone's in their underwear and the Oscars are two hours away. That's definitely one way to bond.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela explores life, love and death on Earth's second-tallest peak in the new season of Extreme.\nStraddling the border of Pakistan and China in the Karakoram mountain range, K2 is often referred to as the \"savage mountain\". Towering 8,611m and reaching into the heavens like a snowcapped pyramid, K2 is the world's second-tallest mountain (topped only by Everest) and arguably the hardest to climb. In Peak Danger, the second season of BBC's Extreme podcast, host and historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela chronicles the harrowing tale of newlyweds Cecilie Skog and Rolf Bae, who scaled K2 in 2008 \u2013 and found themselves in a disaster that would see 11 climbers lose their lives in two days.\nFor Skog, the allure of the mountains came early. She was born surrounded by formidable peaks and explains that even as a child, she often found herself drawn to the alpine heights all around her. Like many climbers, she called the rush of scaling mountains \"addictive\".\n\"I grew up in \u00c5lesund, a little town on the west coast of Norway, and surrounding this little town is mountains everywhere. It is really beautiful there,\" Skog says on the podcast. \"These mountains, they should have given it with, like a warning sign: 'this is really addictive.'\"\nWhile climbing mountains all over the world, Skog also found love and married climber Rolf Bae. After years of honing their skills, the couple decided their honeymoon would be the perfect opportunity to venture to Asia and attempt to scale K2. Their journey started in Pakistan at the Baltoro Glacier, a near-mythical landscape home to six peaks over 7,900m. The beautiful, nearly untouched scenery is one draw, but it is accompanied by the thrill of high altitude, steep cliffs and breathtaking ascents \u2013 and the always-present spectre of cheating death.\n\"If you are going to take on K2, you got to be at the top of your game. That is why it is known, in climbing circles, as 'the mountaineer's mountain,'\" Petrzela says. That reputation was something Skog and Bae were well aware of, as well as the inevitable possibility of facing a life-or-death emergency.\n\"The most important thing cannot be to summit; the most important thing has to be to come back home alive,\" Skog says in the podcast.\nUpon their arrival to the Karakoram Range, Skog and Bae joined some 30 hopeful, optimistic climbers from far-flung countries such as Serbia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and South Korea, as well as a team of Nepalese and Pakistani porters. They were experienced and knowledgeable about the conditions, the dangers and the possibility of inclement weather. Avalanches, rockfall and unpredictable blizzards weren't unheard of \u2013 but there was another sign: a memorial at the beginning of the journey dedicated to those who had lost their lives while attempting to scale K2.\n\"When you arrive, you see a huge pile of brown, weathered rocks, all stacked on top of one another. It is adorned with crisscrossing flags, and pictures of fallen climbers,\" Petrzela says.\nThe memorial isn't enough to deter climbers, nor is the low oxygen level and bitingly cold temperatures.\n\"What I experienced was: 'why am I here\u2026 am I in the right place?' I questioned myself. I questioned my motivation for being there,\" fellow climber Dr Eric Meyer says on the podcast. \"And then you start to reflect on\u2026 is it worth the risk?\"\nListen to the whole Extreme story\nPeak Danger is season 2 of Extreme, the BBC podcast about those who chase the impossible, who strive for superhuman status and refuse to accept that life has any limits. Historian and podcaster Natalia Mehlman Petrzela returns with a sky-high story of human vs nature and surviving against all the odds.\u00a0\nIf you would like to listen to the full podcast series, search for Extreme wherever you get your podcasts.\u00a0\nIt has never been easier for intrepid travellers to challenge themselves and face K2. Petrzela explains on the podcast that a cottage industry has materialised and offers all the necessities for anyone hoping to be among the few who can say they've summited the mountain. However, that commercialisation has led to concerns over climbers' safety and the sometimes-laissez-faire approach to what is undoubtedly a very dangerous trek.\n\"There is no rulebook to mountain climbing. No international association telling you what or how to climb. And there is nothing to stop anyone from making mountaineering into big business. Nowadays, for the right price, you too can buy your way onto the slopes of an 8,000m peak,\" Petrzela says. While there is no association overseeing all climbers, there is the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (or UIAA), which \"developed standards for over 25 types of safety equipment, including helmets, harnesses and [crampons]\".\nAs the group faced a few unexpected challenges \u2013 including a curious case of missing equipment \u2013 Skog explains that the prospect of turning around did enter her mind, but she was still drawn to the peak. \"[I thought] we should turn around, because this is crazy. But again... we are looking up and we can see the summit there. We are so close,\" Skog says. \"The closer you get to the summit, the harder it is to turn around.\"\n\"It is like a kind of compulsion, an inexorable force pulling them further and further up the mountain,\" Petrzela says.\nIn what would later be known as the 2008 K2 disaster \u2013 coming after a similar 1986 tragedy that saw five people die on the mountain \u2013 a massive ice avalanche swept away climbers' rope lines, causing many to fall from an especially treacherous section of the mountain known as the \"Bottlekneck\". The incident killed 11 climbers, including Bae. Even the ones lucky enough to make it off K2 were dealing with frostbite and other injuries. Survivors, Petrzela explains, felt \"shellshocked, like a soldier returning from war.\"\nThe names of the climbers were added to the makeshift memorial at basecamp. Reports would call the incident \"one of the worst tragedies in Himalayan history\".\nMore like this: \n \u2022\u00a0The big climate moments to look out for in 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Why some of the world's borders are changing\n\u2022\u00a0The mountaineers collecting hard-to-reach data\nStill, Skog continued adventuring \u2013 partly, she says, to feel the same sense of wonder she shared with her husband. She enlisted friends to trek across Greenland and, later, she completed an unassisted crossing of Antarctica. She has even returned to the Himalayas, though her new perspective has shifted everything, even summit fever.\n\"I did not have the same feeling being there. I felt that this does not belong to me anymore,\" she says.\n*This article is adapted from a script by Natalia Mehlman Petrzela and Leigh Meyer.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Kate Bush wrote her chart-topping debut single when she was just 18 years old. She told the BBC about the origins of a literary love song that began a unique career in music.\nKate Bush's debut single, Wuthering Heights, was theatrical, undeniably eccentric, and utterly unlike the punk, new wave, prog rock and disco music that dominated the UK charts when it was released 47 years ago this week. And yet the single became an unexpected number one hit in 1978 \u2013 the first song written and performed by a female artist to reach the UK top spot. What makes the single even more idiosyncratic is that its title and story are borrowed from Emily Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel \u2013 but it was actually a television series that spurred Bush to write the song.\n\"Well, I hadn't read the book, that wasn't what inspired it. It was a television series they had years ago,\" she told Michael Aspel in a BBC interview in 1978. As a teenager she had come across the end of an episode of a 1967 BBC adaptation of Bront\u00eb's tale of doomed love. Its startling imagery had captivated her. \"I just managed to catch the very last few minutes where there was a hand coming through the window and blood everywhere and glass. And I just didn't know what was going on and someone explained the story.\"\nBush was just 19 years old when the single was released. Although she may have seemed precocious to the public, she had been writing songs for years. Born in June 1958, the youngest of three children, she grew up in an artistic household in Kent, England. Her father, a doctor, and her mother, a nurse, surrounded their children with music, and encouraged them to learn instruments from an early age. Both of her older brothers were heavily involved in music and poetry, and she would join them performing Irish and English folk songs at home. \"My brothers are very musical, yes. They were really responsible for turning me onto it in the first place. They were always playing music when I was a kid,\" she told Aspel.\nBush began to compose her own songs in her early teens, recording them on homemade demo tapes. One of these tapes found its way via a family friend into the hands of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, who recognised the promise in her songwriting and was particularly taken with the otherworldly quality of her voice. \"I was intrigued by this strange voice,\" he told BBC podcast Profile in 2022. \"I went to her house, met her parents down in Kent, and she played me, God, it must have been 40 or 50 songs.\"\u00a0\nGilmour re-recorded three of Bush's songs with her in his studio for a new demo, and then encouraged Pink Floyd's record label, EMI, to sign her at the age of 16. As Bush was still at school, she spent the first two years of her contract continuing with her studies, while using the record company's advance to enrol in interpretive dance classes with mime artist and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, who had previously taught a young David Bowie.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\n\"I've definitely been influenced by Lindsay Kemp because he's one of my heroes and he was my teacher for a while,\" she told Aspel. \"Marcel Marceau, I admire his stuff, but it is a little too staid for me. It's the art of illusion. It's not really the actual showing of emotion, which is what Lindsay teaches, and for me that's perfect because that's what music in any form of art is about. It's emotion, it's from inside.\"\u00a0\nAt the same time, she was also honing her musical craft. She formed a group called the KT Bush Band and began playing in London pubs while working on songs for her debut album, The Kick Inside. The singer told the BBC that she tended to compose these songs late in the evening. \"It seems to be the time of day that things gather, you know. I wake up about 11pm, I'm sort of sleepy all day, then at 11pm I really wake up.\" One night when she was 18, she sat down at the piano to write a song from the perspective of Bront\u00eb's passionate, conflicted heroine, Catherine Earnshaw, who haunts her lover Heathcliff, both during her life and after she dies. The imagery from the Wuthering Heights TV adaptation \"was just hanging around for years\", she said, \"so I read the book in order to get the research right\".\nThe song's lyrics evoke Catherine's obsessive longing for Heathcliff, her mercurial nature, and the couple's charged, destructive relationship. Bush also wanted to convey Catherine's ghostly presence, so she adopted high-pitched, keening vocals to give the song an eerie, haunting air. \"It was really specifically for that song, it was that high because of the subject matter,\" she said. \"I'm playing Cathy and she was a spirit, and it needed some kind of ethereal effect, and it seemed to be the best way to do it, to get a high register.\"\u00a0\nWuthering Heights, with its lush, sweeping orchestration, its literary sensibilities, and Bush's soaring theatrical delivery, did not strike her record company as an obvious radio hit. EMI instead wanted the rockier sounding James and the Cold Gun, a favourite from her KT Bush Band's pub set, to be the first single from the album. But Bush was adamant that Wuthering Heights should be her debut \u2013 and EMI eventually relented.\u00a0\nTo accompany its release, two music videos were filmed. One was\u00a0studio-based\u00a0and the other was shot\u00a0outside, with Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, standing in for the novel's windswept Yorkshire moors. For the shoots, Bush used the interpretive dance instruction she had received to mesmerising effect. Both videos feature her gazing intensely at the camera, clad in floaty dresses while performing dramatic and emotive dance movements to express the spectral essence of Cathy. Her dance routine was so distinctive that it became something of a cultural touchstone, inspiring both\u00a0comedic homages\u00a0and an\u00a0annual event\u00a0called The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever, at which Bush devotees recreate her performance from the videos.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eartha Kitt: from 'extreme poverty' to stardom\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\n\u2022\u00a0How a child star saved a Hollywood studio\nThe single would prove to be her breakthrough. Within three weeks of being released, it had reached number one, getting a boost from Bush's arresting mime-style performance on the BBC's music chart show,\u00a0Top of the Pops. It knocked Abba's Take a Chance on Me off the UK singles chart's top spot, and stayed there for a month. It also topped the charts in Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Australia. Her album, The Kick Inside, when it was released the following month, sold more than one million copies. She would go on to collect an Ivor Novello award in 1979 for The Man with The Child in His Eyes, released as her second single from the album.\nWuthering Heights marked the start of Bush's innovative, critically acclaimed and shape-shifting musical career. She has now released a total of 10 studio albums, melding diverse influences, complex musical storytelling and new technologies, such as sampling, to spawn hit singles like Hounds of Love and Babooshka. She has also collaborated with artists including Prince and Elton John. Her duet with Peter Gabriel, Don't Give Up, would pick up another Ivor Novello award in 1987.\nIn 2022, Bush reached a whole new generation of fans when her 1985 hit Running Up That Hill started trending on TikTok, after being used in the Netflix series Stranger Things. It gave Bush her first top 10 hit in the US and reached number one in the UK charts, 44 years after her debut single. \"It's just extraordinary,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in 2022. \"It's such a great series. I thought that the track would get some attention. But I just never imagined that it would be anything like this.\"\nAt the time of her appearance on Michael Aspel's show in 1978, she was already working on her second studio album, Lionheart, and preparing to tour her music with what would be a lavish stage show called The Tour of Life. The performances embraced the theatricality of Bush's songs, featuring dance, poetry, mime and magic, with the singer making multiple costume changes and pioneering the use of a headset microphone on stage. \"I've always wanted to be involved in music,\" Bush told Aspel. \"I never thought I would be able to sing them, to sing my songs, but it seems that I have done it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Instead, squeeze the bottom of the cup to break the seal and wiggle it off, says physiotherapist Dr Kate Lough, an expert in pelvic health. \nShe says it may take women a few menstrual cycles to become accustomed to using one, and stresses wearing a cup should not hurt. \nShe told BBC News: \"Generally, they are a very safe product. \n\"When it's in correctly, you shouldn't feel it.\"\nMenstrual cups vary in shape, size and firmness, so Dr Lough advises shopping around to find one that matches your requirements. \nIf you have recently had a contraceptive coil put into your womb, there is a very small chance it could become dislodged, or even removed, by suction.\nIf the threads cannot be located, or a woman thinks her coil has moved, manufacturers recommend using additional contraception and seeing a healthcare professional for advice.\nMenstrual discs are similar to cups but are worn higher in the vaginal canal, just below the cervix.",

        "article_text": "Warning: Contains offensive language and descriptions of sexual violence\nIt was a warm February night when an ominous message popped into Hannah Grundy's inbox in Sydney.\n\"I will just keep emailing because I think this is worthy of your attention,\" the anonymous sender wrote.\nInside was a link, and a warning in bold: \"[This] contains disturbing material.\"\nShe hesitated for a moment, fearing it was a scam.\nThe reality was so much worse. The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats.\n\"You're tied up in them,\" she recalls. \"You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage.\"\nWritten in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out.\nThat email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards.\nThe web page was called \"The Destruction of Hannah\", and at the top of it was a poll where hundreds of people had voted on the vicious ways they wanted to abuse her.\nBelow was a thread of more than 600 vile photos, with Hannah's face stitched on to them. Buried in between them were chilling threats.\n\"I'm closing in on this slut,\" the main poster said.\n\"I want to hide in her house and wait until she is alone, grab her from behind and... feel her struggle.\"\nIt's been three years now, but the 35-year-old school teacher has no trouble recalling the \"pure shock\" that coursed through when she and partner Kris Ventura, 33, opened the page.\n\"You immediately feel unsafe,\" Hannah tells me, eyes wide as she grips a mug of peppermint tea in her living room.\nClicking through the website Kris had also found photos of their close friends, along with images depicting at least 60 other women, many also from Sydney.\nThe couple quickly realised the pictures used to create the deepfakes were from the women's private social media accounts. And the penny dropped: this was someone they all knew.\nDesperate to find out who, Hannah and Kris spent hours at the kitchen table, identifying the women, searching their social media friends lists for a common link, and methodically building a dossier of evidence.\nWithin four hours, they had a list of three potential suspects.\nOn it, but immediately discounted, was their close friend from university Andrew Hayler. The trio had met while working at a campus bar, and the staff there quickly formed deep friendships.\nAnd Andy, as they called him - the supervisor - was the glue of the group.\nHe was considerate and affable, Hannah says - the kind of guy who looked out for women in the bar and made sure his female friends got home safely after a night out.\nThey all hung out regularly, went on holidays together, loved and trusted each other.\n\"I thought of him as a very close friend,\" Hannah says.\n\"We were just so sure that he was a good person.\"\nBut soon they'd whittled down the list to just one name: his.\nWhen Hannah woke the next morning and went to the police station, mingling with her shock and horror was a \"naive\" sliver of optimism.\n\"We thought they'd go grab him that afternoon,\" Kris says with a wry smile.\nInstead, Hannah says she was met with disdain.\nShe recalls one New South Wales Police officer asking what she'd done to Andy. At one stage they suggested Hannah simply ask him to stop. Later, they pointed to a picture of her in a skimpy outfit and said \"you look cute in this one\", she says.\nNew South Wales Police declined to comment to the BBC on the specifics of Hannah's case.\nBut she says the way her complaint was handled made her feel like she was making \"a big deal out of nothing\".\n\"And for me, it felt quite life-changing,\" says Hannah. \nAny faith she still held that police would help quickly dwindled.\nAmid delays, she turned to Australia's eSafety Commissioner, but under its powers as a regulatory body it could only offer help in taking the content down.\nDesperate, the couple hired a lawyer and commissioned a digital forensics analyst to move things along.\nIn the meantime, to avoid tipping Andy off and to keep themselves safe, they retreated inwards.\n\"The world for you just gets smaller. You don't speak to people. You don't really go out,\" Hannah says.\nIntense fear and loneliness filled the void instead.\n\"We'd already had to suspend complete belief to understand that he'd done these things, so [the idea of] him actually coming to try and rape you or hurt you isn't that much of a bigger stretch.\"\nThe couple installed cameras all around their house and set up location tracking on Hannah's devices. She began wearing a health watch 24/7, so someone would know if her heartbeat rose - or ceased.\n\"I stopped having the windows open because I was scared... maybe someone would come in,\" Hannah explains.\n\"We slept with a knife in both of our bedside tables because we just thought: 'What if?'\"\nStill feeling abandoned by police, Kris had taken on the burden of monitoring the site for the slightest sign of escalation towards Hannah and any of their friends - who, to protect the investigation, still did not know anything.\nGuilt ate at the pair: \"We had a constant battle about whether it was right to not tell them,\" Hannah says.\nAt one point told the investigation had been suspended, Hannah and Kris forked out even more money for a detailed forensic report, and threatened to make a formal complaint to the police watchdog. All up, they spent over A$20,000 (\u00a310,200; $12,400) trying to protect themselves and stop Andy.\nFinally a new detective was assigned and within two weeks police were raiding Andy's house. He admitted everything.\nFilled with relief, then dread, Hannah began calling her friends to break the news.\n\"My stomach just dropped,\" Jessica Stuart says, recalling the moment she learned what Andy had done to her photos.\n\"I felt really violated but\u2026 I don't think I fully comprehended.\"\nFor her, again, the sucker punch was that a friend who she loved like \"family\" was behind the crime. Andy had always appeared \"so unassuming\" and \"really thoughtful\" - someone she'd called for help through a difficult time.\n\"It's been really hard to reconcile that those two people are actually the same person.\"\nThe case was uncharted territory for Australia.\nFor at least a decade, experts have warned advances in technology would lead to a wave of AI crimes. But authorities have been caught on the back foot, leaving deepfake victims - overwhelmingly women - vulnerable.\nAt the time Andy was arrested in 2022, there was no offence for creating or sharing deepfake pornography in NSW, or anywhere else in Australia, and the country had never seen a case of this magnitude before.\nThe 39-year-old was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence - a low-level catch-all offence for many internet crimes - and Hannah was warned to keep her expectations low.\n\"We were prepared to go to court and for him to get a slap on the wrist,\" she says.\nBut she and the 25 other women who decided to be part of the case were determined Andy be held accountable. One after the other, several gave crushing statements at his sentencing hearing last year.\n\"You didn't just betray my friendship, but you shattered the sense of safety I used to take for granted,\" Jess told the court. \"The world feels unfamiliar and dangerous, I am constantly anxious, I have nightmares when I am able to sleep. \n\"Forming new friendships feels impossible, burdened by the constant question: 'Could this person be like you?'\"\nWhen it came time for Andy to apologise to the women he'd targeted, Jess and Hannah couldn't stomach being in the room. They walked out.\n\"There is nothing that he can say to me that makes it better, and I wanted him to know that,\" Hannah says.\nAndy told the court that creating the images had felt \"empowering\" as \"an outlet\" for a \"dark\" part of his psyche, but that he didn't think they would cause real harm.\n\"I have really done a terrible thing and I am so very sorry,\" he said.\nJudge Jane Culver was not convinced of his remorse, saying while there was \"some contrition\", he didn't seem to understand the clearly \"profound and ongoing\" suffering that his \"prolific\" and \"disturbing\" offending had caused.\nShe sentenced Andy to nine years in jail - in what has been called a landmark decision.\n\"The gasp that went through the court... it was such a relief,\" Jess says.\n\"It was the first time I felt like we had actually been listened to.\"\nAndy will be eligible for parole in December 2029, but has told the court he intends to challenge his sentence.\nNicole Shackleton, a law expert who researches technology and gender, told the BBC the \"unprecedented\" case set a surprising, and significant, legal standard for future cases.\nThe judge had recognised \"this wasn't merely something that happened online\" and that such behaviour was \"tied to offline violence against women\", said Dr Shackleton, from Melbourne's RMIT University.\nBut Australia and other countries remain poor at regulating the use of AI and proactively investigating its misuse, experts like her argue.\nAustralia has recently criminalised the creation and sharing of deepfake pornography at a national level. But many other countries have legislation accused of containing loopholes, or do not criminalise deepfake pornography at all. In the UK, sharing it is an offence, but creating or soliciting it is not - though this is about to change.\nAnd in the face of under-trained and under-resourced police forces, many victims like Hannah or private investigators - like the one who tipped her off - are left to be de facto detectives and regulators.\nIn a statement, NSW Police said investigations into AI crimes are a challenging, \"resource and time intensive process\", and training has recently been beefed up \"with the goal that every officer... can respond to these types of crimes effectively\".\nThe force also works with the eSafety Commissioner and tech companies to take down deepfake abuse, the statement added.\neSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said removal of the distressing material is the top priority for most victim-survivors, and eSafety had \"an extremely high success rate in achieving it\".\nBut eSafety does not have the punitive powers to pursue criminal investigations and penalties, she added in a statement to the BBC.\n\"You can have whatever laws you like, [but] if you have a police force that are incompetent...\" Kris says, trailing off.\n\"We're obviously angry at Andy. But it is also disgusting that the only way you get justice with something like this is if you're two people in your 30s that can afford to bully the police.\"\nThey're determined for things to be different for future victims. In the past six months alone, two schoolboys in separate cases in NSW and Victoria have been reported to police for allegedly creating mass deepfake nudes of their classmates.\nAfter several years of hell, Hannah is also trying to move on.\nBut Andy's looming appeal threatens the hard work she's done to rebuild her life and mental health.\nKnees at her chest and feet tucked under her on the couch, she says Andy got the sentence he deserved.\n\"Because for me, and for the other girls, it is forever\u2026 they will always be on the internet,\" she says.\nShe still pays for a service which scours the web for the pictures, and she worries about future friends, employers, students - her own children - finding them.\nOne of her biggest fears is that her best memories will never be reclaimed.\n\"You post things on Facebook and Instagram because they're the happiest moments of your life. You get a dog, you buy a house, you get engaged and you post a photo.\n\"He had turned every single one of those moments for us into porn. And so when you see that photo\u2026 well, now I see myself getting raped.\"\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line",

        "article_text": "The Uzbekistan government is on an ambitious tourism drive \u2013 but is sparring with heritage experts over how to protect its historical sites.\nThe sound of a jackhammer rattles through the air. In Bukhara, a former trading hub on the ancient Silk Road in what is now Uzbekistan, tourism is the new commerce and new hotels are popping up on every street corner. I've counted three construction sites in a 100m radius outside the former caravanserai where I'm staying, and I observe the progress of a guesthouse being built just metres from a 16th-Century madrasa (school).\u00a0\nIt's a trend that's visible across the country. In the capital, Tashkent, construction work for a shopping mall lines the avenue leading up to the Hazrati Imam mosque complex, next to the shiny, almost-completed Centre for Islamic Civilisation. The small historic city of Khiva, surrounded by mud fortifications, cannot expand outwards \u2013 but mud-and-straw residences in the historic centre are being knocked down and replaced by modern hotels. It is perhaps most obvious in Samarkand, where billionaire businessman Bakhtiyor Fazilov has poured money into flashy projects to raise his home city's profile, such as a new airline, an international airport that opened in 2022 and the strange Disneyland facsimile Silk Road Samarkand, a soulless and sanitised tourist resort situated outside the city.\n\"The concept of the Silk Road is being applied to everything,\" said Svetlana Gorshenina, a researcher and member of the Uzbek heritage protection association Alerte H\u00e9ritage. \"You have Silk Road restaurants, Silk Road shops, Silk Road tours, tourist agencies uniquely dedicated to the Silk Road. It has become our only selling point and it's self-exoticising. It's a kind of self-orientalisation, which is a hangover from colonialism.\"\u00a0\nThe thing is: it's working. The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index now ranks Uzbekistan at 78th out of 119 countries, moving up 16 places in the last five years. The Uzbek government is ploughing investment into its tourism sector after the country's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, laid out his Uzbekistan 2030 strategy in September 2023, an enormous governmental plan detailing the goals to be achieved in various sectors by that date. That includes increasing the number of foreign tourists to 15 million, more than double the 6.6 million visitors to the country in 2023. He has also called for the creation of \"tourist clusters\" \u2013 complexes providing accommodation and other services for tourists in one place.\u00a0\nOne of these new clusters is the reason I've come to Bukhara. It's a 33-hectare site on the fringes of the old town on which a leisure complex called\u00a0Eternal Bukhara\u00a0will soon be built. Samarkand tycoon Fazilov has a hand in this project too: he's the chairman of one of Uzbekistan's largest contractors, Enter Engineering, which is building the complex. The company is cagey about its actual plans for the site \u2013 not least because it has already proven quite contentious.\nInitial plans reported in the local press described it as an \"ethnographic park\" that would recreate traditional Uzbek buildings such as\u00a0chaikhanas\u00a0(teahouses), as well as restaurants serving Uzbek cuisine and a museum about Uzbek culture. But the 3D renderings pasted on the high walls that surround the construction site show instead blocky, modernist shopping arcades and glimmering pools adorned with abstract art.\u00a0\n\"We're not trying to replicate historic buildings. We don't want to repeat history \u2013 but to create something that will have its own impact,\" Rustam Khaydarov, the deputy general director of Enter Engineering, told me, as we sat in a portacabin in the construction site with excavators and diggers whirring nearby. \"It will be a place where people can relax, with cafes and a cultural centre for local artists to display their art. And about 70% of it will remain a green site.\"\nEnter Engineering also plans to build a number of five-star hotels, with up to 700 rooms on site. \"Wealthy people already come to Bukhara but are dissatisfied with the quality of the hotels. So we want to improve the class of hotels on offer,\" he said. There will also be medical facilities to cater to a new type of tourist that Uzbekistan is trying to attract: visitors who come for cheap healthcare, from dentistry to plastic surgery.\nThis area used to be Bukhara's administrative zone, with government offices and a large public sports arena. The demolition of the sports stadium im 2024 provoked a public outcry (which is rare in Uzbekistan, a country where public dissent is swiftly silenced), and Enter Engineering responded by building three more sports facilities on the town's outskirts. The site is ringed by a road, beyond which there are drab and semi-dilapidated residential apartment blocks, with many ground-floor spaces for businesses unoccupied. Although it's just a short walk to Bukhara's tourist sites and monuments, it feels a world away from the relentless tourism of the city centre.\nGet off the tourist trail\nMany travellers head from Samarkand to Khiva but don't hesitate to go off the beaten path. Here are some ideas:\n\u2022\u00a0Rent a car or book a tour to visit the ancient Khorezm fortresses and Zoroastrian sites on the road between Nukus and Urgench, where you can scramble around the desert ruins, poke into chambers and walk along walls that were built between the 4th Century BCE and the 7th Century CE.\n\u2022\u00a0The city of Nukus is a rapidly developing tourist destination, known above all for the Nukus Museum of Art's extensive collection of Russian avant-garde art.\n\u2022 Go to the Fergana Valley for a slower pace of travel. Spending time in a teahouse in a rural mountain village will give you a better understanding of how people live in Uzbekistan.\n\"For years, Uzbekistan has been undergoing a process of emptying city centres of their inhabitants,\" explained Gorshenina. \"We are witnessing a transformation of towns into museum-towns that are made for tourists. In Bukhara, you already have this 'tourist zone' that is clearly separate from the rest of the town where residents live. It's become an open-air museum.\"\nAn Uzbek architect, who did not want to be named for this article but whom I met in his office in Bukhara, told me, \"Every year, there are more and more tourists. I have always thought of Bukhara as a living organism, and that organism is becoming very weak and fragile. It should not become a town solely for tourists but for its residents as well. It risks becoming a Venice in the desert.\"\nAlerte H\u00e9ritage is fiercely opposed to the Eternal Bukhara project, in part because it says that locals were not consulted about the use of the space, and also because of the loss of important Soviet-era architecture, such as a government building that was the former regional headquarters of the Communist Party, built in 1987. It was torn down in early 2024.\nThe Uzbek architect said that the current government was repeating mistakes from the Soviet era. \"The Soviet Union destroyed a lot of heritage and replaced it with Soviet buildings because it wanted to leave its own imprint. That tradition of demolition is still \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 in our blood.\"\nAlthough Eternal Bukhara is not within the historical centre that is classified as a Unesco World Heritage site, it falls within the \"buffer zone\", which still requires Unesco validation before urban changes can be made. When contacted, Monia Adjiwanou, a spokesperson for Unesco, said that they were \"closely monitoring\" the situation, adding: \"We hope that the authorities will comply with their commitments to the World Heritage Convention and that they will not carry out any demolition/construction project without the prior assessment of the World Heritage Committee in July 2025.\"\nDemolition on the Eternal Bukhara site is visibly ongoing, with only a handful of buildings still standing. That seems problematic for Unesco \u2013 even more so as the international organisation plans to host this year's General Conference in Uzbekistan, which would be the first time since 1986 that the annual meeting has been held outside Paris.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Central Asia's glittering new Silk Road jewel\n\u2022\u00a0 Plov: Uzbekistan's rice dish with 'sexual power'\n\u2022\u00a0 The Silk Road city most tourists miss\n\"Unesco is toothless, without principles. What has it really done for Central Asia, for Uzbekistan?\" asked the Uzbek architect. Both he and Alerte H\u00e9ritage are unconvinced by Unesco's warnings to Enter Engineering. Khaydarov, however, assured me that the company will not launch any building work until they get Unesco's green light \u2013 which means that they could still be waiting for months before construction is able to begin.\n\"We don't want the city's image to be damaged,\" Khaydarov said. \"This is a reputational issue. But we chose this area because it's in the buffer zone and we are confident we will get Unesco's approval to continue.\"\nHe also insisted that locals support the plans, describing it as \"a social project\" rather than a commercial one. \"We will create minimum 15,000 jobs with this site,\" he promised.\nUzbekistan's headlong rush into the world of mass tourism could well create thousands of jobs and boost the country's economy \u2013 but it risks bulldozing or damaging both the country's ancient heritage and vestiges of its more recent history. You only have to walk through Bukhara's covered bazaars that were once filled with Uzbek silk and crafts and are now teeming with imported, mass-produced goods to get a feel for what the country may look like in just a few years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

We're trying to pin those down.\"\nJanuary 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.\nEarly last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.\nThis year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.\nWhile La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.\n\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.\n\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"\nA number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.\nOne idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.\nWhile it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.\nThe El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.\nBut it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.\n\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.\nThe fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.\n\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"\nAnother prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.\nThese tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.\nAerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.\nBut it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.\nAnd this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.\nMost scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.\nThe \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.\nThis theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.\nCurrently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.\nWhat they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.\n\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.\n\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"\nGraphics by Erwan Rivault\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "He's an expert on all of NOLA's iconic foods but has a special place in his heart for gumbo. Here are his favourite bowls \u2013 from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine \u2013 unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\u00a0\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of\u00a0Acadian\u00a0descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\u00a0\nThe SpeciaList\nEmeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a\u00a0YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of\u00a0opinions on the\u00a0right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game \u2013 or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra \u2013 a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse \u2013 famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live \u00a0\u2013 has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo \u2013 served over rice \u2013 Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant, Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit\u00a0since\u00a0the space first opened in 1990. \"It used to be made with seafood,\" he says, \"then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.\"\nIt's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the\u00a0presentation\u00a0has too. \"The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,\" he says, \"that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux.\" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.\nHere are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.\nCommander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.\nPo'boys\nPo'boys (sometimes also written \"poor boy\") are one of NOLA's classic sandwiches \u2013 meats or seafood stuffed into crisp, light French bread. Lagasse's favourite? The po'boys at Domilise's. Inside the little yellow house on Annunciation Street, customers can choose from a whole menu of classic po'boys,\u00a0but Lagasse's top picks are fried shrimp, fried oysters or roast beef. \"You need about 20 napkins to eat the roast beef po-boy. It's soaked in gravy on NOLA-style French bread,\" he says. \"People debate whether to get it dressed\u00a0or not. I go for the dressed\u00a0po'boy, with\u00a0lettuce, tomato and pickles.\"\nIn the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct\u00a0blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of \"haute Creole cuisine\", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo.\u00a0\nEven though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. \"Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,\" he says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.commanderspalace.com/\nAddress: 1403 Washington Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: +1 504-899-8221\nInstagram: @commanderspalace\nCaf\u00e9 Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.\nLagasse's Insider Tips\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde\u00a0in the French Quarter is iconic but crawling with tourists; locals get their hot sugar-dusted beignets at Caf\u00e9\u00a0du Monde's other location on\u00a0Dreyfous Drive\u00a0instead.\u00a0\nAnd for Lagasse, NOLA's best fried chicken comes from\u00a0Popeye's Chicken, the international fast food chain, founded in New Orleans in 1972. \"I don't know why, it's the same formula. But I think NOLA has the best Popeye's fried chicken, no matter which one you go to.\"\u00a0\nWhile most of the hundreds of interns who have been through the 14-week programme go on to work in restaurants, others become nurses, mechanics, technicians and more. What's consistent is that they all learn to cook classic New Orleans fare like red beans and rice, po'boys and gumbo. \"Caf\u00e9 Reconcile's chicken and sausage gumbo has a rich roux with lots of okra,\" says Lagasse, \"and it always hits the spot.\" It's a win-win, according to Lagasse. \"Your meal helps support the workforce development,\" he says. \"What could be better?\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://cafereconcile.org/\nAddress: 1631 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70113\nPhone: +1 504-568-1157\nInstagram:\u00a0@cafereconcile\nKnown as the Queen of Creole cuisine, chef Leah Chase was the heart behind legendary Dooky Chase Restaurant, first opened\u00a0in 1941 by\u00a0her in-laws and later evolving into a meeting place for excellent food, music and dialogue.\nJambalaya\nWhen Lagasse craves jambalaya \u2013 a rice dish cooked with a variety of proteins \u2013 he goes to one of two places for what he defines as the best: \"one that's not too dry and not too wet.\" The first is Toups' Meatery where the jambalaya is prepared with chicken and smoky andouille sausage. He also likes the jambalaya at Dooky Chase, which includes three kinds of pork, such as smoked ham, smoked chorizo and sausage. \"In the city of New Orleans, jambalaya is primarily made in a Creole style, so you'll often find tomato in it, but out in the country there's no tomato\".\nIn the upstairs dining room, many influential leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr and the Reverend\u00a0A L Davis, met to discuss crucial issues affecting the African American community.\nStarting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday),\u00a0Chase would\u00a0cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens.\u00a0\"They do a traditional style of gumbo,\" explains Lagasse, \"but during Lent it has lots of greens \u2013 mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens\u00a0and okra, and it's finished with gumbo fil\u00e9.\"\u00a0\u00a0For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted\u00a0New Orleanians from all over the city.\u00a0Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar \"Dook\" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition. Some say it is the best in New\u00a0Orleans.\nWebsite: https://www.dookychaserestaurants.com/\nAddress: 2301 Orleans Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119\nPhone: +1 504-821-0600\nInstagram: @dookychaserestaurant\nFamily-owned since 1919, Casamento's on Magazine Street is primarily known for its briny Gulf Coast oysters, which peak during cool autumn and winter months. \"Locals love to go there whenever they see the open sign, which is only when the oysters are great,\" says Lagasse. He enjoys eating the plump oysters alongside their much-loved seafood gumbo, which is replete with shrimp, tomatoes and okra. Other Casamento's must-haves include their oyster stew and sandwiches, made with their signature \"pan bread\" instead of traditional French bread.\nWebsite: https://casamentosrestaurant.com/\nAddress: 4330 Magazine Street, New Orleans, LA 70115\nPhone: +1 504-895-9761\nInstagram: @casamentosrestaurant\nChef Frank Brigtsen also started his culinary career as an apprentice under Paul Prudhomme, who helped him and his wife Marna open\u00a0Brigtsen's\u00a0in 1986 in NOLA's Riverbend\u00a0neighbourhood, where he serves classic\u00a0Cajun-Creole cuisine.\u00a0\n\"Frank is an excellent cook,\" says Lagasse, \"and I really like his fil\u00e9 gumbo, which is Cajun-style, meaning it has no tomatoes.\" Cajun gumbo also doesn't include okra. Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with fil\u00e9 powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. \"The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,\" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour. This cuts the cooking time significantly and yields a deep, complex flavour.\u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://brigtsens.com/\nAddress: 723 Dante Street, New Orleans, LA 70118\nPhone: +1 504-861-7610\nInstagram:\u00a0@frankbrigtsen\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

'Hospitality equals quality of life'Guest speaker at the JHA lunch and former politician Ben Shenton said 2025 would be a make or break year for the island. \"We've been in decline for many years... we need to do change and we need to take pride in what we do,\" he said.He said the island should become an attractive holiday destination for older tourists to capitalise on the increased travel spending of baby boomers.He said: \"Baby boomers spend three times more than younger generations on travel, they want safe destinations, they want tidy destinations, they want quality of service - Jersey can offer all that.

This would be a devastating hit even for institutions with large endowments.\u201d\nThe American Council on Education said in a statement that the grant funding for indirect costs have allowed universities to maintain \"cutting-edge laboratories\" and advanced technologies needed to stay ahead of foreign competitors and deliver breakthroughs in research. \nThe group's president, Ted Mitchell, told the Washington Post that some labs had already begun shutting down over the weekend in light of the news. \nHe said groups were expected to file a lawsuit over the cuts as soon as Monday. \nThe suggestion to cap indirect research grant money was included in Project 2025, a \"wish list\" of conservative priorities written by the Heritage Foundation think tank.\n\"Congress should cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund research efforts,\" the proposal states.

They can say I've done a bad job, I'm not up to it or whatever. That's fine,\" Postecoglou said.\n\"What I'm saying is you can't be critical of our players' performances at this time.\n\"If you want to measure anything on what they're doing at the moment, other than the extreme situation they're dealing with, then I think your analysis is skewed and it's not objective.\n\"If it's to get rid of me that's fine.

If you think that is not at all a factor in how this team is performing, then there's nothing else I can say,\" said Postecoglou.\n\"I think this group of players, once we get the rest of the group in, will be an outstanding team.

He is being tested in his belief, he is asking questions of himself. But that is where you need support.\n\"You need everyone on the same page. You have the fans pulling in one direction, Postecoglou fronting up talking about injuries, and players who know they should be playing better. It's not a good recipe.\"\nDespite Postecoglou's praise, fellow pundit Dion Dublin said he believed members of the Tottenham team were currently \"hiding\".\n\"The players who should be giving options don't have the confidence to have the ball in positions where they should receive it, they don't back themselves,\" Dublin said.\n\"We used to call it hiding, going into a position where you can't receive it.

Are the doomsayers mistaken over the current state of professional golf?\nAre we wrong to keep highlighting divisions and splits, tumbling television audiences and the controversial sources of so much of the sport's income?\nShould we not be viewing this from a glass half full perspective? Indeed if we do, is the tumbler not overflowing with good news? Look at what is happening in the royal and ancient game.\nIt is back live on free-to-air television in the UK, the leader of the free world is brokering a united future and top stars are stirring up a giant simulator to \"grow the game\".\nA game that, by the way, is growing.\nLeading LIV Golf player to get spot in The Open\nDetry wins maiden PGA Tour title at Phoenix Open\nGainer seals first LET title with play-off win\nAt its recreational level the post-covid boom is being sustained. More people are playing, 'influencers' are attracting dedicated followings and the latest season of a behind the scenes docu-series is about to drop on Netflix.\nWhat's not to like? Tiger Woods makes his latest comeback this week at Torrey Pines and we are edging ever closer to the year's first major at a time when the four grand slam tournaments have never been stronger.\nLast weekend there was action all over the globe, with an international array of golfers competing for vast sums of money.\nPoland's Adrian Meronk pocketed a cool $4m (\u00a33.2m) for victory under the lights in LIV's season opener in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, while Tom McKibbin's debut yielded more than $1m in individual and team earnings for the young Northern Irishman.\nWhat a time to be a male pro golfer.\nThomas Detry's brilliant win at the Phoenix Open earned the Belgian $1.67m while in Qatar, the DP World Tour's players scrapped over spoils, admittedly smaller but guaranteed by the European tour's alliance with America.\nChina's Haotong Li pocketed \u00a3341,000 for his victory, taking a big step towards gaining access to the riches of America next season, made available to the top 10 not otherwise exempt in the Race to Dubai.\nIsn't this the essence of professional golf? Creating tournaments that supply lucrative livings for the very best players in the world?\nOf course it is.\nAnd LIV, whose arrival prompted such a cash injection is off to a flier at the start of its fourth season. New chief executive Scott O'Neil is already chalking up handy victories.\nA TV deal with Fox Sports in the US is a significant upgrade on the CW Network - a backwater in terms of sports broadcasting - and now the agreement with ITV means live golf is again available free-to-air in the UK.\nAn even bigger success is the R&A and the USGA providing formalised pathways for those competing in these 54-hole shotgun starts to qualify for The Open and US Opens.\nLIV just got legit and that is a very big deal.\nThe game remains split, though, while creating the competitive tension that is benefitting players - just as O'Neil's predecessor Greg Norman predicted it would.\nSeparate camps remain, in one corner The PGA and DP World Tours, LIV in the other; with the Masters, US PGA Championship, US Open and Open sitting in the middle.\nThose four majors are the only places where we can see all of the world's best players; Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy take on LIV recruits such as Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka.\nThe majors are exactly what is said on their tin and have never been more eagerly anticipated. They also show an elevated state that golf could achieve on a far more regular basis.\nAnd this is where the leader of the free world comes in. US president Donald Trump wants unity, sees nothing wrong with doing deals with Saudi Arabia and has the power to get it sorted.\nThe PGA Tour has asked him to become involved in brokering a deal with the Saudi Public Investment Fund's golf-mad governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan. They've been trying to thrash this out since June 2023 and every aspect has, so far, been top secret.\nThat is, until Trump's involvement. He clearly wants an agreement and more importantly needs to be seen publicly as the catalyst. That's the art of his kind of dealmaking.\nNever mind that for many, the source of the next tranche of money that will pour into the sport's bulging coffers is so contentious. Now there seems little fear that Saudi Arabia's heavily criticised record on human rights will ever derail golf's gravy train.\nThese are the good times, remember.\nBut golf's future depends on people not being turned off by excessive earnings perceived as inappropriately high for what is on show.\nHow many people will watch LIV on Fox or ITV? Or, for that matter, the PGA Tour on the traditional golfing networks in the US and UK.  Will this September's Ryder Cup carry its usual lustre now American players are being paid to represent their country?\nWill Woods and McIlroy's TGL simulator show capture the imagination of a new golfing audience? The jury is out on that one with much to debate.\nWill Netflix's third series of Full Swing produce heroic figures around who fans can rally? Or will we be turned off by the opulence of the gilded golfing life enjoyed by the biggest stars?\nAnd will there still be scope for the uniquely heart-warming stories that golf has always generated?\nThe quest to improve 'the product' is set to spell the end of Monday qualifiers for what will become 120 player tournaments on the PGA Tour next year.\nLast week Will Chandler played his way into the Waste Management field in Arizona on the Monday and finished sixth after playing Sunday's final round with world number one Scheffler.\nThese are the sort of stories that keep us dreaming.  Cara Gainer's first Ladies European Tour (LET) win is another of those - the 29-year-old Englishwoman's play-off win in the Lalla Meryum Cup in Morocco last weekend is a much deserved breakthrough.\nThis week she is off to a more lucrative LET event - you guessed it - the Aramco Series event at Riyadh Golf Club in Saudi Arabia.

New chief executive Scott O'Neil is already chalking up handy victories.A TV deal with Fox Sports in the US is a significant upgrade on the CW Network - a backwater in terms of sports broadcasting - and now the agreement with ITV means live golf is again available free-to-air in the UK.An even bigger success is the R&A and the USGA providing formalised pathways for those competing in these 54-hole shotgun starts to qualify for The Open and US Opens.LIV just got legit and that is a very big deal.The game remains split, though, while creating the competitive tension that is benefitting players - just as O'Neil's predecessor Greg Norman predicted it would.Separate camps remain, in one corner The PGA and DP World Tours, LIV in the other; with the Masters, US PGA Championship, US Open and Open sitting in the middle.Those four majors are the only places where we can see all of the world's best players; Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy take on LIV recruits such as Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka.The majors are exactly what is said on their tin and have never been more eagerly anticipated. Tiger Woods makes his latest comeback this week at Torrey Pines and we are edging ever closer to the year's first major at a time when the four grand slam tournaments have never been stronger.Last weekend there was action all over the globe, with an international array of golfers competing for vast sums of money.Poland's Adrian Meronk pocketed a cool $4m (\u00a33.2m) for victory under the lights in LIV's season opener in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, while Tom McKibbin's debut yielded more than $1m in individual and team earnings for the young Northern Irishman.What a time to be a male pro golfer.Thomas Detry's brilliant win at the Phoenix Open earned the Belgian $1.67m while in Qatar, the DP World Tour's players scrapped over spoils, admittedly smaller but guaranteed by the European tour's alliance with America.China's Haotong Li pocketed \u00a3341,000 for his victory, taking a big step towards gaining access to the riches of America next season, made available to the top 10 not otherwise exempt in the Race to Dubai.Isn't this the essence of professional golf? Now there seems little fear that Saudi Arabia's heavily criticised record on human rights will ever derail golf's gravy train.These are the good times, remember.But golf's future depends on people not being turned off by excessive earnings perceived as inappropriately high for what is on show.How many people will watch LIV on Fox or ITV? Or will we be turned off by the opulence of the gilded golfing life enjoyed by the biggest stars?And will there still be scope for the uniquely heart-warming stories that golf has always generated?The quest to improve 'the product' is set to spell the end of Monday qualifiers for what will become 120 player tournaments on the PGA Tour next year.Last week Will Chandler played his way into the Waste Management field in Arizona on the Monday and finished sixth after playing Sunday's final round with world number one Scheffler.These are the sort of stories that keep us dreaming.",

        "article_text": "Ever since absinthe was outlawed due to rumours it led to insanity, this simple drink has become the nation's go-to apertif.\nIt's difficult to imagine France without ap\u00e9ro (aperitif hour), that magic moment when time stops, and suddenly, everyone has a drink in hand.\u00a0\nIn a country so proud of its regional products, it's not surprising that the contents of one's aperitif glass varies, from cassis-scented kir in Burgundy to beer on the Belgian border to cloudy aniseed-infused pastis in Marseille. But despite its strong association with southern France, conjuring images of lazy summer afternoons playing p\u00e9tanque by the sea, one ap\u00e9ro spirit is omnipresent in France: pastis. Not only do sales of pastis represent one-fifth of all spirits sold nationwide, but it's the default aperitif drink as far north as Picardie.\n\"It's not like some of those other regional aperitifs,\" said Forest Collins, author of the book Drink Like a Local: Paris. \"Pineau de Charentes, you're mainly going to find around Cognac. Pommeau, you're mainly going to find in Normandy. But it's pretty likely that anywhere in France, you might find a bottle of pastis.\"\nYet, pastis didn't become France's go-to aperitif by design. If not for the nation's 1915 ban of absinthe due to its alleged harmful effects and the marketing chops of Marseillais Paul Ricard, the herbal liqueur may never have become France's most famous.\nAbsinthe's quiet conquest of France occurred in the wake of the 19th Century phylloxera epidemic that wiped out nearly half of the country's vineyards. Soon, it supplanted not just wine but beer in the north, cider in Normandy and flavoured wines like quinquina, explained Marie-Claude Delahaye, author of the book L'Absinthe: Histoire de la F\u00e9e Verteand founder of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Absinthe in Auvers-sur-Oise. According to Delahaye, absinthe introduced aniseed to the aperitif hour, along with a \"playful and convivial ritual\" of diluting the 75% ABV liquor with sugar and water.\n\"It was the sprout of what could be an extraordinary success,\" Delahaye said. Yet, absinthe's rise to fame was stymied in 1915, when it was banned throughout the country following rumours that it led to insanity. Aficionados immediately began clamouring for something to fill the aniseed-scented gap. \"If absinthe had continued to be commercialised,\" explained Delahaye, \"pastis never would have appeared.\"\nWhile pastis and absinthe share an aniseed flavour profile, the similarities stop there. Distilled absinthe boasts more complexity than sweetened, macerated pastis, and at 40 to 45% ABV, pastis' alcoholic power pales in comparison. This put pastis at an advantage, according to Collins: absinthe, she said, was seen as \"the drink of degenerate artists\" (including Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse Lautrec and Vincent Van Gogh, who even included the spirit in some of his paintings). With pastis, meanwhile, drinkers still got \"that nice little buzz, and that nice aniseed flavour\" without the negative connotations.\n\"I think that's the effect that pastis had on aperitif culture,\" Collins said. \"It allowed this drinking culture of aniseed to carry on.\"\nOrder a pastis in most cafes, and it'll be poured from a bottle emblazoned with a bright yellow sun and one name: Ricard. But before there was Ricard, there was Pernod \u2013 two Pernods, to be precise. Both Henri-Louis Pernod and the unrelated Jules-F\u00e9lix Pernod launched anisettes in 1918, merging their companies in 1928. Ricard, meanwhile, only began selling his version in 1932. If Ricard's became the most famous, it's in large part thanks to his marketing chops. He appealed immediately to the French love of terroir, deriving the name of his anisette from the Proven\u00e7al pastisson(mixture), and attributing his recipe to \"a poacher \u2026 who knew all of the herbs of the mountains and the garriguesurrounding us\". He soon set about disseminating the story \u2013 and the local liqueur \u2013 by going door to door to bistros and cafes across France.\nHow to ap\u00e9ro\nAp\u00e9ro hour usually takes place between 18:00 and 19:30, when France's squares and terraces fill with groups sipping golden demis of beer, pink kirs and pastis. Cafes typically serve a free bowl of crisps, pretzels or olives with your chosen ap\u00e9ro, though the food is secondary to the drinks and conversation. Ap\u00e9ro isn't about inebriation, and it's not uncommon for friends to nurse a drink for an hour before parting ways to have dinner at home.\n\"He used to say, 'Make a friend a day,'\" said Gabrielle Arevikian-Xerri, brand director of Pernod-Ricard.\nPerhaps Ricard's most successful initiative was merch. An amateur artist, Ricard created branded posters evoking sunny Marseille, not to mention glasses and ashtrays, bucket hats and caps. He released thousands of such objects during the 1948 Tour de France; today, they're omnipresent at French flea markets, where keen collectors track them down.\nJacky Roussial is one such collector. Over 39 years, Roussial has amassed no fewer than 3,500 Ricard-branded objects, including 180 different goblets, playing cards and umbrellas. His most prized pastis possession is a pichet tambourin, a 1950s-era pitcher depicting a tambourine player he dubs \"the grail of any collector\". It goes for about \u20ac4,000.\nThese pitchers aren't just trinkets; they're an essential part of serving pastis, a drink that's customisable by design. Each 2cl pour is meant to be diluted with water to taste. Many also sweeten their pastis with syrup: a blend of bright green mint and pastis is called a perroquet (parrot), while the addition of grenadine makes a tomate (tomato). Of them, Arevikian-Xerri said, the mauresque (a blend of pastis and local southern orgeat) is the most popular.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A Michelin-starred chef's guide to Marseille\n\u2022 The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nIn recent years, modern mixologists have been toying with crafting more complex pastis cocktails. Margot Lecarpentier of Paris cocktail bar Combat likes blending it with cacha\u00e7a to highlight floral notes, while Aur\u00e9lie Panhelleux, co-founder of CopperBay cocktail bars in both Marseille and Paris, combines it with gin, lemon juice, dill-infused orgeat and citron to create the house Mauresco. But these creations remain anecdotal at best, according to Collins, who said that while there was an attempt to make a pastis-scented play on an Ap\u00e9rol Spritz popular about a decade ago, \"it hasn't really happened.\"\n\"I think the traditional way is the way that pretty much anybody drinks pastis,\" she said.\nEven Lecarpentier agrees. \"Ninety-five percent of French people will tell you pastis is drunk with a glass of water and ice cubes,\" she said. \"It would be weird to not serve it like that.\"\nPastis does incur a ritual, of sorts, as the drinker dilutes the spirit with water from a branded pitcher until it takes on its cloudy-yellow hue, adding syrup or ice to taste. According to Collins, the relative simplicity of how pastis is served \u2013 especially compared to absinthe, which was dripped into a glass through a sugar cube set on a special perforated spoon \u2013 is part of the drink's enduring popularity. \"Everyone in their house can have a little pitcher, but not everybody is going to go out and get an absinthe fountain and absinthe spoons,\" she said.\nPastis' accessibility has cemented its place as the aperitif to rule all aperitifs. Drunk by men and women, by young and old, pastis is above all, according to Arevikian-Xerri, \"for bringing people together. Whatever their background, whatever their social status.\"\nBut it's not just pastis that remains popular \u2013 it's Ricard. Other brands exist, of course, from high-end Henri Bardouin to organic Distillerie de la Plaine. Even Pernod, which merged with its one-time rival in 1975, has stood the test of time. But in 2022, Ricard wasn't just the most-sold pastis in France; it was the most-sold product in French hypermarkets, outranking mineral water, Coca-Cola and Nutella. In the leadup to Christmas 2024, Ricard outsold even Champagne.\n\"Pastis is a question of taste, and often of tradition,\" said Panhelleux. \"In France, it's the only spirit people order by brand.\"\n\"I don't drink pastis,\" echoed Roussial. \"I drink Ricard.\"\nSome of the drink's popularity still stems from the fantasy Ricard constructed. \"It's the symbol of sunshine, of holidays, of the Mediterranean, of far niente (the art of doing nothing), of conviviality,\" said Roussial. But connotations aside, for Collins, its charm comes above all from its omnipresence.\n\"For most people, it's just a way of life. Almost like a [table wine],\" she said.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Greenlandic politician and Inuit educator Aleqa Hammond shares her top ways to experience the country, from sampling Greenlandic cuisine to viewing the Northern Lights in Ilulissat.\nAt a staggering 2.16 million sq km, Greenland is the world's largest island \u2013 and its least densely populated. A colossal ice sheet covers roughly 80% of its mass; most of the population (56,000) lives in urban areas along its south-west coast.\u00a0\nThe Specialist\nAleqa Hammond is a politician and former member of the Greenland Parliament. Her political career began in 2005 when she held various ministerial roles, including Minister of Finances and Foreign Affairs. In 2013, she became Greenland's first female Prime Minister.\nBut Greenland still attracts visitors with its stunning natural backdrop of glaciers and icebergs. Adventurers enjoy kayaking, hiking and dog sledding in the vast wilderness. The midnight sun, Northern Lights and colourful villages only add to this Arctic destination's allure.\nWe asked Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister (2013-2014), how to explore this land of contrasts. \"Greenland is so vast and huge and undiscovered in many ways that after the Ilulissat Icefjord received a World Heritage site designation in 2004, it was not recognised by Unesco again for another 13 years,\" she says. \"It has three now, which shows that the country has so much to offer.\"\nIn November 2024, Nuuk International Airport opened in the country's capital. And in 2026, two more international airports will open \u2013 in Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest city, and Qaqortoq, in southern Greenland. As Greenlanders prepare for an influx of visitors, Hammond is optimistic. \"Everybody wants this change because we want to have a stronger economy, and we want to be more self-sufficient.\"\nAccording to the Greenlandic Ministry of Business, Trade, Mineral Resources, Justice and Gender Equality, over the past five years, tourism in Greenland has grown by 46%; primarily due to a surge in demand from travellers eager to explore new destinations after Covid-19 \u2013 particularly those with wide-open spaces. The numbers are expected to rise with the new airports.\nBut \"Greenland does not want mass tourism,\" says Hammond. \"Greenland wants better tourism. We want tourism that's to the benefit of the people of this country, not to overwhelm us. It's going to be a very controlled place, and that makes it special.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hammond's favourite ways to experience Greenland.\nNuuk, Greenland's capital, is home to approximately 20,000 residents. But \"it's very much a metropolitan city\", says Hammond. \"There's museums, there's cafes, there's so many shopping opportunities and concerts, it's so alive.\"\nLocated in Nuuk's Colonial Harbour, the Greenland National Museum & Archives is a fascinating place to delve into the country's history and culture. \"The museum is absolutely worth visiting,\" Hammond says. \"It's well organised and it's doing a lot of archaeological excavations in remote places in Greenland.\"\nThe best of 2025\nGreenland was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list\u00a0here.\nThe museum's exhibitions cover a vast span of Greenland's history, from the first Paleo-Eskimo cultures that arrived thousands of years ago to a period of Norse settlement in the 10th Century and Thule migration in the 13th Century, followed by Danish colonisation in the 18th Century.\nThe museum is also known for its collection of well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies \u2013 the naturally mummified remains of a family from Northern Greenland's Paleo-Eskimo Saqqaq culture, who lived sometime between 2500 BCE to 800 BCE. \"They are the oldest mummies in the world of Inuit heritage,\" says Hammond, who is Inuit as well as a respected Inuit educator and former commissioner of the\u00a0Inuit Circumpolar Council.\u00a0\"These mummies were found in 1972 in the Uummannaq area of North Greenland, where I'm from.\"\nExhibiting the mummies hasn't been without controversy. \"It was a big discussion back then whether they should belong to a museum or not, and a lot of Greenlanders were not very happy that they ended up there,\" Hammond says. \"Today, everybody's satisfied because [of] world interest on how the Inuit have been living and are living, and what cultural heritage we have. This is the oldest proof.\"\nWebsite:\u00a0https://en.nka.gl/\nAddress: Hans Egedesvej 8, Box 145, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 32 26 11\nInstagram:\u00a0@natmus_gl\nWhen it comes to fine dining in Nuuk, one of Hammond's favourites is Restaurant Sarfalik, which is located on the top floor of the upscale Hotel Hans Egede in the city centre. Sarfalik specialises in showcasing the best of Greenlandic cuisine, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced from local hunters and fishermen. A blend of Inuit tradition and survival, cooking techniques include drying, fermenting and smoking.\n\"Using local ingredients is a trend in Greenland,\" Hammond says. \"We have such great resources, and each town has its own open fish and meat market with a choice of musk ox, reindeer, halibut and cod. Everything is there.\"\nSarfalik has an open layout with a cosy brasserie feel, and the menu features traditional Greenlandic fare with a modern twist as well as internationally inspired creations. There's also a tasting menu that allows for sampling various entrees. \"It's not enormous plates, but very beautiful and wonderfully made,\" Hammond says. \"It's a gastronomic experience.\"\nWebsite: https://hhe.gl/restaurant-sarfalik/?lang=en\nAddress: Hotel Hans Egede, Aqqusinersuaq 1 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 34 80 00\nInstagram: @sarfalik\nA significant cultural hub, Nuuk Art Museum features a mix of Greenlandic and international art. \"Because we have many artists in Nuuk, it's very well-visited, and it's a big museum that's absolutely worth a trip,\" says Hammond.\nA gift from Danish-Greenlandic philanthropists Svend and Helene Junge Pedersen to the people of Nuuk, the museum is situated in city centre in a former Adventist church, striking for its high ceilings, wooden beams and stained-glass windows. In addition to exhibitions, the museum also hosts events, workshops and educational programmes, such as an art walk around the city that can be downloaded as a podcast.\nIts primary focus is to showcase the work of Greenlandic artists and the depiction of Greenland in art. This includes a significant number of works by early 20th-Century landscape artist Emanuel A Petersen, known for his romanticised portrayals of Greenlandic nature. The museum's exhibits showcase a variety of media, including paintings, watercolours, drawings and sculptures made from materials like soapstone, ivory and wood.\n\"Greenlandic art is an expression of Inuit culture, which is deeply connected to the land, wildlife and Arctic traditions,\" Hammond says. \"Our spirits, legends, and traditional beliefs are also often depicted, as well as animals important for survival like seals, whales and polar bears.\"\nWebsite: https://www.nuukkunstmuseum.com/\nAddress: Kissarneqqortuunnguaq 5, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 36 60 33\nInstagram: @nuukartmuseum\nDepending on the time of year, the Northern Lights are literally all around. \"It's like trees,\" Hammond says. \"You don't really notice them unless one specific tree is really beautiful. We don't have trees here, but there's a lot of Northern Lights.\"\nTip\nTo view Greenland's Northern Lights, \"from September until February is a perfect time\", says Hammond. \"Greenland has long, dark nights during this period, and clearer skies compared to other seasons. When we know that there's going to be a very good Northern Lights night, we put on a lot of clothes, bring our tea and take a hike around the village. Then we just sit there and enjoy it. And nobody says a word for a very long time, because this beauty is so much more than 1,000 words.\"\nDespite their frequent occurrence, the Northern Lights are also a reminder of Hammond's heritage, so she never takes them for granted.\n\"The Northern Lights have both entertainment and cultural value,\" she says. \"We know who they are \u2013 that's our ancestors, and that's why we love watching them. We honour our ancestors a lot, and we can always see them in our environment. In Greenland, you can see them in the sky.\"\nWitnessing the Northern Lights is especially meaningful at the Ilulissat Icefjord, a deep sea inlet filled with massive icebergs. A Unesco World Heritage site, it is one of the fastest moving and most active glaciers in the world, moving around 40m per day.\n\"It's very easy to walk out to the Icefjord at night because there's a boardwalk and you can take it out to a bench with the best view in the world,\" Hammond says. \"Sit on that bench and you'll be right in front of the icebergs. The Northern Lights give a special light to the icefjord, and the icebergs get another glow, another colour. It's the ultimate Northern Lights experience.\"\nLocated on the west coast, Ilulissat is about 250km north of the Arctic Circle. Historically a fishing village, it is also known for its sled dogs. The Icefjord is a short bus ride from town and the boardwalk is easily accessible as it extends from the car park.\nThe Ilulissat Icefjord Centre is situated on the edge of the icefjord and provides interactive displays, artefacts and scientific data.\nWebsite:\u00a0https://isfjordscentret.gl/en/ilulissat-icefjord-centre/\nAddress: Sermermiut Aqqutaa B 2089, 3952 Ilulissat\nPhone: +299 55 55 88\nInstagram:\u00a0@ilulissat_isfjordscentret\nGreenland is as famous for its epic wildlife as it is for its stunning Northern Lights. Depending on the region, you might see reindeer, musk oxen, polar bears, Arctic foxes and a variety of whales \u2013 including elusive narwhals with their unicorn-like tusks.\nHammond suggests admiring the island's wildlife via both land and sea by combining a city break with an expedition cruise like Adventure Canada, which offers six Greenland itineraries with plans to expand to East Greenland in 2025.\nThe best chance to spot polar bears is in East Greenland because, according to Hammond, \"the big impact of the North Pole ice melting is that they are all going that way\". Arctic wildlife \u2013 both marine and mammal \u2013 can be spotted via a small ship cruise or by hiking the Arctic Circle Trail. Because polar bears are powerful predators, observing them from a ship provides a safe vantage point and minimises risks. Arctic cruises are the best ways to spot marine wildlife, especially whales, seals and walruses.\n\"Fly into Greenland first, and then take your own trip, maybe from Nuuk to Ilulissat or vice versa, and go on from there,\" she says. \"You can come in a few days ahead of time and experience the authentic Greenland for yourself by partaking in activities like hiking before you embark on the cruise. Greenland has incredible hiking trails, and the further you venture into the wilderness, the more likely you are to encounter animals.\"\nWebsite: https://www.adventurecanada.com/\nPhone: +1 800 363 7566\nInstagram: @adventure.canada\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

No big money spent.\"\nHe then explained that the Palestinians would have no right of return to Gaza because their lives would be \"much better\" elsewhere, contradicting Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who told reporters last week that the relocations would be temporary during reconstruction.\n\"If they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever - it's not habitable,\" Trump said.\n\"I'm talking about starting to build, and I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year.\"\nEgypt and Jordan's leaders have rejected both Trump's plan and his previous requests to take in refugees from Gaza.\nHowever, Jordan's King Abdullah is due to meet Trump in Washington on Tuesday, while Israel's president said Trump would also hold talks with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the coming days.\nOn Sunday, Trump doubled down on his takeover plan.\n\"I'm committed to buying and owning Gaza,\" he told reporters on board Air Force One, without explaining who he would buy the territory from and how the US would own it.\n\"As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we're committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn't move back.\"\nTrump said people from all over the world would be able to move to Gaza and that Palestinians would not want to go back there.\n\"They only go back because they have no alternative,\" he claimed.\nIsrael's prime minister praised Trump's proposal at a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday.\n\"For a full year, we have been told that on the 'day after', the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organisation], the Palestinian Authority, needs to be in the Strip,\" Netanyahu said.\n\"President Trump came with a completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel, a revolutionary and creative vision, which we are discussing. He is very determined to carry it out. This also opens many possibilities before us.\"\nThe Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry said: \"The rights of our people and our land are not for sale, exchange or bargaining.\"\n\"The Israeli government and Prime Minister Netanyahu are trying to cover up the crimes of genocide, forced displacement and annexation which they have committed against our people,\" it added.\n\"For this purpose, they continue to promote slogans and positions which are separate from the political reality and far from the requirements of the political solutions to the conflict.\"\nA political official from Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries - said Trump's remarks were \"absurd\" and reflected \"deep ignorance of Palestine and the region\".\n\"Gaza is not a property to be sold and bought. It is an integral part of our occupied Palestinian land,\" Izzat al-Rishq stated.\nPalestinians fear a repeat of the Nakba, or \"catastrophe\", when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.\nMany of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the West Bank, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war along with Gaza, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN. \nPalestinians insist on the right of those refugees to return but Israel has refused this.\nIsrael unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods. The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.\nGermany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz also strongly criticised Trump's plan on Sunday, calling it a \"scandal\".\n\"I say this with the Egyptian government, with the Jordanian government and with the people who can count on human dignity: the relocation of a population is unacceptable and against international law,\" he said during a televised pre-election debate.\nPalestinian officials and Arab states also condemned comments made by Netanyahu in a TV interview last week.\nAn Israeli journalist was discussing efforts to normalise diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia when he mistakenly said there would be no progress without the creation of a \"Saudi state\".\n\"A Palestinian state.\" Netanyahu corrected him, before adding: \"Unless you want the Palestinian state to be in Saudi Arabia? They have a lot of territory.\"\nEgypt called the suggestion \"reckless\" and something that \"directly infringes upon Saudi sovereignty\", while Jordan said it was \"a flagrant violation of international law\".\nSaudi Arabia said on Sunday that it appreciated the \"condemnation, disapproval and total rejection announced by the brotherly countries towards what Benjamin Netanyahu stated regarding the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land\".",

        "article_text": "New Zealand has accused the Cook Islands government of a lack of transparency over its plans to strike a partnership deal with China. \nThe tiny Pacific Island nation's leader, Mark Brown, is this week making his country's first ever state visit to Beijing in order to sign the agreement. \nHowever, New Zealand says it was not properly consulted over the plans, leading to what Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described as a \"dispute\". \nThe Cook Islands is hugely reliant on New Zealand under a longstanding \"free association\" agreement that provides it with defence and financial support. China's growing influence in the Pacific has challenged the US and its allies, who have held sway for years.\n\"We value our partnership with New Zealand and we expect the same respect,\" Brown said at a press conference last week. He was due to travel to China on Monday.\n\"Disagreements, although difficult, are an inevitable part of international relations but they should never define the entirety of our engagement.\"\nHe has denied any dispute, saying \"engagement has been consistent, respectful and open\" and that the Cook Islands has the right to forge its own path as a self-governing country.\nChina's foreign ministry said that both countries were important partners and that it was ready to work with the Cook Islands to \"achieve new progress\". \n\"The China-Cook Islands relationship is not targeted at any third party and should not be subject to or be disrupted by any third party,\" said spokesman Guo Jiakun. \nBeijing has had diplomatic ties with the Cook Islands since 1997 and is one of its development partners. \nUnder their 60-year-old agreement, the Cook Islands is self governing in \"free association\" with New Zealand. The two countries are expected to consult each other over issues of defence and security. Brown says the new agreement with China will cover areas including infrastructure, trade and tourism.\nDeep deep-sea mining is also expected to be part of the deal. Brown believes that mining valuable minerals on the seabed could be a game-changer for the Cook Islands, creating huge economic wealth.\nHowever, the practice, in which China is a major player, is controversial, and critics believe it will exacerbate climate change - to which the Cook Islands are already vulnerable. \nLuxon said on Monday that while New Zealand had \"very good relations between the Cook Islands and its people\", in this case there had not been transparency.\nAsked at a press conference whether he would consider putting aid to the Cook Islands on hold, as it recently did for Kiribati due to a diplomatic snub, Luxon said he would wait to see what was in the deal. \nUnder the free association agreement Cook Islanders can live, work and access healthcare as New Zealand citizens - benefits some fear they could lose if relations between the two countries further sour.\nThere has also been criticism from some that Brown and his government did not consult the public about the China deal first - something Tina Browne, the leader of the Democratic Party, has described as \"insane\". \nBoth she and fellow opposition leader Teariki Heather, from the Cook Islands United Party, say they have lost confidence in Brown's leadership. \nThat is despite his recent U-turn on a controversial proposal to introduce a separate passport for Cook Island citizens, while also allowing them to retain New Zealand citizenship. Wellington rejected the plan last year. \nThe Cook Islands is not the first Pacific Island nation to strengthen its ties with China. The Solomon Islands signed a security pact with Beijing in 2022, while countries including Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea also have close relations. ",

        "article_text": "The painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nHe joined Manchester United at the age of seven.\nTwenty years, 426 appearances, 138 goals and five trophies later, Marcus Rashford has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nIt will seem strange to see Rashford - the boy from Wythenshawe, United through and through - wearing another team's strip.\nAs recently as November, the idea seemed fanciful.\nHow did we get here?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIn public, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim tried to counter the view that he wanted to jettison Rashford.\nBut United insiders believe the former Sporting boss felt it would be better for everyone if the forward was no longer around.\nEven towards the back end of last week, there was still hopeful talk of a resolution on Rashford's part. Now the reality is sinking in. Amorim has got his way.\nWhat has been very difficult to pinpoint, even though Amorim has given some frank interviews, is the detailed reasoning why the coach was so willing to let him leave.\nIt was all sparked when Amorim dropped Rashford for the Manchester derby on 15 December.\nThree days earlier, the forward had been substituted 11 minutes into the second half of what looked like being an embarrassing Europa League defeat by Czech side Viktoria Plzen.\nRasmus Hojlund came on to replace him and scored two goals to turn the match into a 2-1 win.\nRashford has been omitted from 11 of 12 squads since.\nThe one time he did make a squad - the 2-0 home Premier League defeat by Newcastle on 30 December - he was left on the bench. Afterwards, Amorim was asked why.\nWhen he had to address the subject again before Thursday's Europa League win over Romanian side FCSB, Amorim seemed as if he was starting to get irritated.\nThere is no doubt he has used the Rashford situation as a test of his strength. Sir Alex Ferguson, an illustrious predecessor, may well have approved.\n\"If the coach has no control, he will not last,\" Ferguson explained in a case study for Harvard Business School, published in the weeks after his retirement in 2013.\n\"You have to achieve a position of comprehensive control. Players must recognise that as the manager, you have the status to control events. Before I came to United, I told myself I wasn't going to allow anyone to be stronger than I was. Your personality has to be bigger than theirs.\"\nAmorim's latest comments on the Rashford saga were not as polished but the sentiment was the same.\n\"You [the media] want to make it personal,\" said Amorim. \"I have nothing against Marcus but I have to make the same rules for everybody.\"\nIt was more or less the same message Amorim delivered at the Etihad Stadium in dropping Rashford and forward Alejandro Garnacho for the Manchester derby win over City.\nIn various forms, it has been repeated at least half a dozen times in the interim.\n\"It's important, the performance in training, the performance in the games, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with your team-mates, the way you push your team-mates, everything is important in the context of beginning something, when we want to change a lot of things,\" Amorim outlined. \n\"It's the small details. When people in our club are losing their jobs, we have to put the standards really high.\"\nRashford scored three times in Amorim's first two league games, but hadn't been on the field for the last 12 matches\nRashford responded to that forceful assertion by using a visit to his old school to tell football writer Henry Winter he was ready for \"a new challenge\".\nThat was widely interpreted to mean the player wanted to leave. But sources close to Rashford explained that, as they understood it, he was voicing a general feeling of frustration rather than a desire to try something new.\nThey say he felt he was being eased out of a club he remained attached to - a club he felt he knew far better than those running it.\nClub sources say Rashford has trained well. Unlike Jadon Sancho, who fell out with former United boss Erik ten Hag, again over standards, Rashford was not banished to a different area of the Carrington training ground and told to change on his own.\nWhile Rashford's body language has not always presented the most positive image, recent open training showed a different side.\nDuring the 15-minute sessions broadcast before the Europa League matches against Rangers and FCSB, Rashford was expressive and light-hearted.\nWhen Amorim 'ran the gauntlet' through the first-team squad to mark his 40th birthday, Rashford was among those in the line, smiling after the United boss had charged through.\nThis video can not be played\nMarcus Rashford's best Premier League goals\nIt has never been plain sailing for Rashford at United.\nA succession of managers have felt at times they were not getting the most out of a player with blinding speed, excellent balance and an eye for goal.\nFor the 2022-23 season, the first under Ten Hag, Rashford was diligent, going to the United States for personal sessions to ensure he was ready to go when the real preparations began.\nThe reward was a career-high 30 goals. It is a strike rate no-one else in the United squad can match and is the chief reason why representatives spent time visiting some of European football's biggest clubs - Barcelona, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund - gauging interest and trying to work out what kind of a deal was possible before the transfer window closed.\nBut was the goals output confirmation of Rashford's talent or the exception amid more mediocre returns in recent times?\nThe season before, he found the net twice in his final 28 appearances. Since August 2023, he has scored 15 in total. The drop-off is alarming. Even sources close to the 27-year-old accept he is not playing well.\nHowever, despite missing the past 11 games, he is still United's joint-fourth highest scorer this season with seven, the same as \u00a372m signing Hojlund, who has played four more games.\nOnly Amad Diallo (six), Bruno Fernandes (five) and Hojlund (four) have scored more goals under Amorim than Rashford (three), who has only been on the pitch in 35% of the new head coach's games at United.\nUnited's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney has told Rashford in private he should leave. It is an observation he offered to a wider audience on The Overlap podcast.\n\"I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times,\" he said. \"I've given him my thoughts. I've said: You need to leave the football club.\n\"I went into Carrington to take my kids to game day and Marcus was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games. I remember looking at him thinking: How embarrassing is it that the parents are walking past?\"\nRooney's former United team-mate Rio Ferdinand used similar terms to describe how he would feel if a manager had called out his training performances as Amorim had to Rashford.\n\"My heart, my pride, my ego. It's embarrassment,\" Ferdinand said.\n\"For someone to question you giving 100% for the team, saying you're lacking effort and taking shortcuts: That's a damning comment. There's no way back for Marcus after that.\"\nThe mural on the side of a cafe in Withington, south Manchester, was created by a street artist in tribute after Rashford's campaign to extend free school meals during the coronavirus pandemic\nOne theory floated by a source with an understanding of the workings at Old Trafford pointed to financial matters.\nRashford and Casemiro - who has not been omitted from Amorim's squad like the England man but has played only three times since the Plzen game - are by far United's highest earners. The theory is their presence makes it difficult for United to get their profligacy in the transfer market under control.\nIf they left, representatives of prospective signings would be unable to use them as a benchmark for wage negotiations.\nConsequently, it is not until those salaries are off the books that United can properly start to move forward in a more sustainable manner, without the threat of profit and sustainability breaches hanging over them. Those rules also feed the view that homegrown stars such as Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo might need to be sold.\nUnited have grown used to subsidising moves for highly paid players who are not reaching the standards required and no longer wanted by the manager of the day. Their wage bill is one of the highest in world football. Few would say United have been getting value for money.\nAlexis Sanchez, Donny van de Beek, Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Sancho have all fallen into that bracket.\nRashford is the next one out, with United believing they have done well to negotiate a deal that, they say, covers 75% of his wages.\nSources close to the player were adamant the interest in him was huge.\nThere were offers from the Saudi Pro-League, but he felt accepting might mean abandoning his England career.\nA big ambition was to join Barcelona, but they needed to offload players to make it happen. That scenario never materialised into anything close to reality.\nSo Villa, emboldened financially by the \u00a371m sale of Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr, made their pitch.\nThere is plenty about the switch that makes sense. Villa's status is currently greater than that of United. They are pushing for a top-five slot, despite Saturday's defeat at Wolves, and have a Champions League last-16 game in March to look forward to. Unai Emery needs someone who can play through the centre, if required, or in a wide slot. Although he prefers to be on the left, Rashford can do all of this.\nEmery, it is being stressed, was a huge selling point. On a personal level, Rashford doesn't need to move house. \nSo the lifelong Manchester United fan, who felt so entwined with his team, will now wear the claret and blue of Villa, at least until the end of the season. \nAs for Amorim, he has made the big call. He no longer has to answer questions about a player who belongs to another club.\nBut he needs to deliver success himself. If he doesn't, and Rashford does well, he will be in a very uncomfortable position.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Goal of a lifetime' Jamie Donley's brilliant shot bounces in off Stefan Ortega\nThe history books will say Leyton Orient led their thrilling FA Cup fourth-round tie with Premier League champions Manchester City for 40 minutes because of a Stefan Ortega own goal.\nForget that.\nTo anyone lucky enough to be there to witness it - a tie Man City recovered to win 2-1 - Leyton Orient scored thanks to a wonder strike from Jamie Donley.\nIt was the Tottenham loanee who seized on the loose ball after City midfielder Nico Gonzalez had the ball taken off him just inside the visitors' half. It was Donley who spotted Ortega off his line and executed a quite brilliant 50-yard chip that sailed over the City goalkeeper.\nYes, the ball struck the bar and only crossed the line because it hit Ortega as the German failed to regain his balance after trying to make the initial save. It was Donley's goal.\n\"It is a shame it has gone down as an own goal,\" said Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens. \"It is not deserved and I am sure Ortega doesn't want it. It is one thing seeing it, it is another executing.\"\nDespite the result, the goal belongs in FA Cup folklore.\nA series of experienced former top-level professionals certainly spoke about the effort as if Donley has scored it.\n\"It's an absolutely remarkable goal,\" said ex-Arsenal defender Martin Keown on Match of the Day. \"It's the strike of a lifetime. To even think about shooting from there - wow.\"\n\"What a spot,\" enthused Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"What a story. It's absolutely sensational.\n\"It will go down as an own goal but it is one of the greatest FA Cup goals.\"\nBut what did it feel like to actually do it? \n\"I know I hit the goal well,\" said Donley. \"I knew it fell for me nicely.\n\"I saw him off his line and luckily it went in. It would have been a lot nicer if we won but it was a good moment.\"\nDonley had previously scored five goals this season. In status or artistic impression, none can compare to this one.\nEven City boss Pep Guardiola, while seething at what he believed was a clear foul on his \u00a350m debutant Gonzalez - whose status as the replacement for injured Ballon d'Or winner Rodri makes him such a key figure, and who, as a result of the perceived infringement, now has his participation in Tuesday's Champions League play-off first-leg in doubt, was full of admiration.\n\"What a goal,\" he said. \"What a fantastic shot - the quality, the technique, the speed, the flight of the ball.\n\"When you concede this goal, you just congratulate Donley. He's an incredible left-footed player and he made a fantastic goal.\"\nMan City come from behind to avoid shock at Orient\n\nA youth international for both England and Northern Ireland, this tie was not the first time Donley had faced City.\nThe 20-year-old made his senior Tottenham debut at Etihad Stadium in December 2023, coming on as a last-minute substitute just before Dejan Kulusevski scored in a memorable 3-3 draw.\nThat was one of four substitute appearances totalling 10 minutes for the Antrim-born midfielder.\nTottenham felt he needed to go away to continue his development.\nOn the evidence of his performance against City, it was not just his Ronnie Radford-esque strike but his all-round industrious performance that made Donley stand out.\nIt was easy to suggest to Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens the goal might have wrecked any chance of luring him back to Brisbane Road next season.\nHowever, as Wellens made clear, that would require his side to secure promotion from League One, where they currently sit ninth.\n\"Spurs have loaned us one of their best young players,\" he said.\n\"We think we have developed him really well over the last six months. If he carries on with same attitude, intensity and work ethic, he might be playing against them [City] week in week out.\n\"Unless we are in the Championship there is no way we get him back next year.

It was Donley's goal. \"Man City come from behind to avoid shock at Orient'Spurs have loaned us one of their best young players'A youth international for both England and Northern Ireland, this tie was not the first time Donley had faced City.The 20-year-old made his senior Tottenham debut at Etihad Stadium in December 2023, coming on as a last-minute substitute just before Dejan Kulusevski scored in a memorable 3-3 draw.That was one of four substitute appearances totalling 10 minutes for the Antrim-born midfielder.Tottenham felt he needed to go away to continue his development.On the evidence of his performance against City, it was not just his Ronnie Radford-esque strike but his all-round industrious performance that made Donley stand out.It was easy to suggest to Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens the goal might have wrecked any chance of luring him back to Brisbane Road next season.However, as Wellens made clear, that would require his side to secure promotion from League One, where they currently sit ninth. \"I know I hit the goal well,\" said Donley.

        "article_text": "Once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\", Albania is turning to its millennia-old sites and rich cultural heritage to recast its image.\nAfter a period of turmoil, places often talk about looking towards the future. However, 40 years after the death of communist dictator Enver Hoxha, Albania is, in many ways, looking to its distant past. A period of extreme isolationism from the 1940s to 1991 led the Balkan nation to close its religious institutions, neglect many of its historical sites and to become known as \"the North Korea of Europe\". But today, Albania is working hard to reclaim its cultural heritage by preserving its natural landscape and embracing its ancient roots.\nThe more-than-2,500-year-old ruins of the city of Butrint is one such example. Dating back to roughly 800BC, the site has long stood in the centre of the Western world, surviving conflicts, absorbing different cultures and leaving multiple layers of history to explore. It was likely a Greek city-state before the Romans expanded it into a bustling town complete with a bathhouse. Later, the Byzantines and Ottomans both left their respective marks on it. Butrint's history tells the story of the Mediterranean's shifting politics and its many cultures and religions \u2013 all of which have shaped modern-day Albania.\n\"In 1992, [Butrint] was the first place in Albania declared a Unesco World Heritage site,\" explained BBC Travel Show host Qasa Alom in a recent episode. \"[It preserves] some of the rich cultural history that lies beyond the shadow cast by the events of the last century.\"\nToday, the city's sprawling ruins are part of the larger\u00a0Butrint National Park, which includes 93-sq-km of forested coastal landscape. In addition to the historic site, the park is also home to\u00a01,200 different plant and animal species. Visitors can explore the ruins of a Hellenistic-era theatre, admire early Christian monuments and then hike the wooded hills or cruise the nearby Lake Butrint.\nThe preservation of both the ruins and the surrounding parkland are the result of a concerted effort from organisations like the\u00a0Butrint Foundation\u00a0and the\u00a0World Monuments Fund. Donations from both groups have helped restore Butrint and protect the surrounding landscape, while also providing training in historic preservation that created much needed jobs to the local community.\n\"It has been a struggle the last 30 years to protect the beauty and the history of Butrint, originally [because of] the neglect after the fall of communism\u2026 but also with the developers trying to build around the site,\" Ani Tare, former director of the Butrint National Park told the BBC.\nButrint isn't the only part of Albania that has experienced a restoration. In the nation's capital, Tirana, located 278km (173 miles) to the north, many Hoxha-era monuments have been torn down to make way for new community spaces.\u00a0Skanderbeg Square, for example, once home to several monuments dedicated to communism and Hoxha's power, is now the largest pedestrian square in the Balkans. Similarly the towering\u00a0Pyramid of Tirana\u00a0has been transformed from a museum dedicated to Hoxha into a park and sculpture garden with sweeping views of the city.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A 'mini-Greece' by the sea\n\u2022\u00a0Maderia: The far-flung 'Hawaii of Europe'\n\u2022\u00a0The 25 best places to travel in 2025\nArt has also helped Albanians shake off the past and reimagine a new national identity in other ways. At Butrint, for example, programming like their\u00a0annual drama festival, put on inside of the site's ancient stone theatre, has helped bring back a sense of pride and history among the local community.\n\"In the beginning [visitors to the festival were] noisy, they didn't understand what was going on and they used to steal the cushions,\" Tare explained. \"In five years, the local people here would come beautifully dressed, nobody makes noise, everyone respected the theatre, nobody stole cushions. Why? Because the culture [of this place] made them aware and gave them a sense of pride.\"\n--\n\u00a0If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "James Wilton was just 18 years old when he volunteered to fight for Ukraine months after finishing college. It was a decision he made with conviction and passion - but it was one which led to his death.\nThe teenager from Huddersfield was killed in a drone attack in the village of Terny on the eastern front.\n\"He had his whole life in front of him,\" says James' father, Graham.\n\"I would swap places with him tomorrow just so he could be sat at home having a pint and watching the darts.\n\"I'm 52, I have lived my life. He was 18, who knows what he could have done? He didn't have a life, that's the worst part of it.\"\nAccording to Graham, James had wanted to join the British Army when he left Royds Hall High School aged 16. Instead he chose to enrol on a course in animal land care at Kirklees College.\nAged 17 and nearing the end of his education, Graham says James began to discuss wanting to go to Ukraine to help with the war effort.\nNeither Graham, James' mother, or his older sisters Sarah, 21, or Sophie, 22, had wanted the youngest member of the family to go, but they were unable to convince him to change his mind.\n\"I sat down with him and had various conversations about why he wanted to do it, what I thought about it, and in the end he decided it was something he wanted to do,\" says Graham, who lived with his only son.\n\"I suppose he thought it was a bit of an adventure and he was going out there to help and hopefully make a difference.\"\nGraham says he reluctantly supported James, adding: \"If I hadn't have done it I would have woken up one morning and he would have gone.\n\"Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Could I have changed his mind? No.\"\nGraham dropped James off at Manchester Airport on 28 April. From there he caught a flight to Krakow then boarded a bus to Ternopil, where he joined up with the International Legion and underwent a basic training programme lasting about four weeks.\nSpeaking ahead of the third anniversary of the start of the war later this month, Graham says his son and his comrades, who hailed from all over the world and had varying degrees of military experience, were \"totally ill-equipped\" and used as \"cannon fodder\".\nIn response, a spokesperson for the International Legion said the strategy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is \"based on the intelligent use of resources, tactical planning, and technological advantages\".\n\"Every offensive or defensive operation is planned based on intelligence and detailed risk analysis,\" they added.\nThe spokesperson said their units receive the same standardized equipment as the Ukrainian Army and are supplied with \"modern weapons\".\n\"The situation with supplies today is fundamentally different from the first months of the full-scale invasion.\"\nStill, Graham is unaware of James having any regrets about his decision during their regular telephone conversations, which he says were part of his son's desire to hold on to some \"normality\".\n\"He met some wonderful people and he would have had a lot of lifelong friends should he have survived.\"\nJames was deployed to the east of the country as he and comrades sought to halt the grinding Russian advance spreading northwards from the occupied Donetsk region.\nGraham says his son was on his first mission in July when he was killed running between two trenches in a field with no cover.\nThey had spoken just the previous night.\n\"He seemed OK. He did say at some point 'I don't think I'm going to be here as long as what I might be. It's a little bit different to what I thought'.\n\"I said: 'It's up to you. If anything goes wrong or pear-shaped I'll come and get you'. That was always an option if he decided he didn't want to be there.\"\nAccording to the International Legion website, volunteers, who are paid for their service, can terminate their contract after six months.\n\"The mission he went on, he didn't have to go. But because his best mate at the time was going he decided 'well I'm going as well'.\n\"Given the circumstances I would have probably done exactly the same.\"\nIn December, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted his country had suffered 43,000 fatalities as a result of the war with another 370,000 soldiers wounded.\nThe death toll of Russian forces was estimated at about 200,000. Neither of these figures has been independently verified.\nGraham made the 1,800-mile trip to Ukraine for his son's funeral.\nReflecting on his death, he says James died \"doing something he felt strongly about\".\n\"It's very, very sad and unfortunate that he didn't get to make as much difference as he would have liked.\n\"What happened to James unfortunately will probably be happening to someone else in the middle of a field in eastern Ukraine.\n\"It's time people back home actually realised what it's like out there.\"\nBack at the home Graham and James shared in Lindley, life is \"quiet\".\n\"He grew up to be a nice young man and he would get on with anybody.\n\"I'll go home tonight and he's not sat there playing Playstation, it's weird.\n\"We were great. We would sit there and have something to eat and talk about all sorts of stuff. There wasn't anything, as far as I know, that he wouldn't tell me, which is why he was open with me when he decided what he was doing.\"\nThe night before James left he had spent the night with his father \"laughing and joking\" and drinking beer in front of the TV.\nGraham's grief is still raw.\n\"It's just so draining. You try not to think about it, you are sort of OK then something comes up and it sets you going again.\n\"He was possibly a younger version of me. Maybe if I was him at a younger age I would have probably done the same thing.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nSix Nations highlights: England 26-25 France\nIn his BBC Sport column, World Cup winner Matt Dawson examines the different outlook that rookie fly-half Fin Smith gave England in their surprise win over France.\nThis was such a gritty performance by England, but by no means perfect. \nIt couldn't have been. France could, perhaps should, have been out of sight.\nFrance's performance in the first 60-odd minutes was good enough to put themselves in an unassailable position, but they coughed up two or three tries.\nSport is like that though.\nIt is not about how many opportunities you create, it is about how many you take. You have to execute and seize those moments.\nAnd Fin Smith did exactly that.\nOver the past year, England have suffered a series of narrow defeats that have left us crying out for nouse, character and game management.\nWhen it mattered on Saturday, they had that in spades.\nOnce England got themselves through an opening passage in which France were getting round the defence, offloading and finding space, they stood up, stayed in the fight, and worked out where to apply the pressure in the right areas.\nFin Smith delivers after 'rabbit in headlights' start\nSix Nations: England win Le Crunch classic\nCool heads and bloody minds combine as England pluck victory from chaos\nFin Smith had a couple of moments, particularly in the first half, in which the reality of being at the centre of a monster Test match hit him hard.\nThere were a few wayward kicks where he looked rushed into decisions by the faster pace of the game.\nBut in the second half, he understood the situation.\nHe saw that England needed to play, needed to be more ambitious.\nBut in that decision you saw the difference between him and Marcus Smith.\nMarcus Smith is a brilliant runner, who breaks lines and beats defenders. No-one in the England team can do that like him.\nBut it means that when the pressure comes on and the team needs to chase, he naturally takes that responsibility on himself and relies on his own individual ability. It will be a goosestep or a dummy. An attempt to conjure something magical out of nothing.\nMarcus Smith made 131 metres from full-back, beating two defenders and making one line break\nFin Smith's mindset is a little different. His first thought will be how to create a situation for the team to exploit.\nHis breadth of vision and understanding meant that he could spot those possibilities.\nFor England's second try he saw Northampton team-mate Tommy Freeman isolated against the smaller Louis Bielle-Biarrey and put the cross-field kick on a sixpence.\nIn that helter-skelter finale to the game, his execution was so accurate; doing the right thing at the right time and understanding the physics of the situation and how to exploit it.\nNowhere was that clearer than on the final, decisive try.\nOutside centre Pierre-Louis Barassi, with four previous caps, was the least experienced of the France starting XV, but England hadn't been able to test him.\nBut after a spotless line-out drill from replacements Jamie George and Ollie Chessum had provided front-foot ball, England worked it perfectly.\nAll the different moving parts came together to unlock the France defence.\nFreeman's dummy run fixed Barassi, Fin Smith floated out the back beautifully and delayed his pass to bring Elliot Daly into the hole on a clever arcing line for the try.\nEngland made it look easy, but to get all those things right when you are deep in the game, with fatigue affecting your skills and the pressure bearing down, is so hard.\nI don't think it gets any better than to finish a game like that.\nThis video can not be played\nSpine-tingling commentary of England\u2019s dramatic last-minute win\nIt showed that England have the ability to dominate teams in those \"championship minutes\" \u2013 the times that really matter, the ones that France fluffed in the first half.\nMarcus Smith is a game-breaker. He score tries, he is on all the posters and is so exciting to watch - his is probably the one name that kids growing up who want to get into rugby know about.\nBut at that level yesterday, it is very difficult to integrate those type of players into key decision-making roles.\nWhile George Furbank recovers from his injury, I think Marcus Smith will play at full-back, but I don't necessarily think he is the long-term solution there.\nFin Smith showed there is a difference in the way you can compete. There has to be an element of calmness and control. For all his individual gifts \u2013 perhaps because of them - that isn't Marcus Smith's forte.\nI don't think it will be a difficult decision for Steve Borthwick. \nIn opting for Marcus Smith over Freddie Steward at full-back, you sacrifice aerial security for more of an attacking threat, but I think that is a price worth paying for this England team.\nLong-term though, particularly with the Northampton connection, I foresee George Furbank coming back into the team at 15.\nTest match rugby is tough.\nIt is uncompromising high-performance environment. We are now more mindful of looking after each other in the work place and that is vital and important. But this is sport and it is a strict meritocracy. If there is someone who will serve the team better, you are out. And that is OK.\nThis video can not be played\nI couldn't have dreamt France win any better - Smith\nIt is up to every player to prove they either deserve to stay in the team or should oust the person in possession of the shirt.\nEngland for too long have handed out caps based on the fact that you were in the week before.\nIt has started to frustrate me. I understand consistency is important, but the number of caps you have doesn't give you some special quality. It means so very little. When talent is coming through, you can't deny it.\nTom Willis is a good example. I thought he had really steady game at number eight and the balance of the back row looked good, with Ben Earl playing at open-side flanker where he is best.\nYou can't be scared to put these players in. We have to see what they are like in the heat of battle. There will be wobbly moments, but you will also see what they are capable of.\nThat was certainly the case with Fin Smith.",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u2013 and which allows art to swivel between different states of being.\nExpunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton\u2019s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It\u2019s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being \u2013 this world and another, life and death.\nOutside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming\u00a0into a\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European\u00a0royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual\u00a0coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange),\u00a0quickly embraced the linguistic\u00a0coincidence in the 1570s. His\u00a0orange-white-and-blue\u00a0rebel flag would become\u00a0the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion\u00a0of everything from Swiss fire\u00a0engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it\u2019s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully.\nFrom antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth\u2019s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire.\nConvinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latin aurum, meaning \u2018gold\u2019, and pigmentum meaning \u2018colour\u2019) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure.\nA spark to a flame\nIntentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet\u2019s plush orange jacket \u2013 its vibrant rumples flickering like flares \u2013 threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer\u2019s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work\u2019s flustering power would be utterly lost.\nNor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard\u2019s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don\u2019t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange \u2013 not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire.\nAnd so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we\u2019ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel. How else can you characterise the realm in which the liquified face of Munch\u2019s hero howls under a strange and estranging burnt-cinnamon sky in The Scream? How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse\u2019s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion?\nCommissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch\u2019s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other\u2019s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground. Her left foot is already sliding out of view. Far from depicting untroubled joy, Matisse\u2019s carefully choreographed masterpiece teeters on cosmic disaster. The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt.\nAmber alert\nMunch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte\u2019s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like orange\u201d. Like it or not, orange is frequently the heat that holds together \u2013 while threatening to break apart \u2013 the visual music of her sinuous mosaics.\nAs crucial as orange has been to the story of art through the end of the last century, it has already dyed itself indelibly into the unfolding fabric of contemporary artistic consciousness. Among the most celebrated major works of the new millennium, The Gates, by Bulgarian artist Christo Yavacheff and French artist Jeanne-Claude (known together as Christo and Jeanne-Claude), colonised New York City\u2019s Central Park in February 2005 with over 7,500 passageways \u2013 each flowing with orange nylon fabric. The lyrical succession of thresholds, which fostered a poetic sense of the endless comings and goings of life \u2013 birth and rebirth, mortality and eternity \u2013 could, on reflection, have only been draped in stirring saffron. To some, the colour echoes the robes of Buddhist monks. But to my mind, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who passed away four years later) were rekindling a sacred flame, inviting those who would come to bask their weary souls in the transformative power of that most mystical of ancient tints: orange.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "France has more than its fair share of flamboyant dishes \u2013 but the most elaborate of all is pressed duck, where a roast duck's bones are crushed to create a decadent \"blood sauce\".\nFollow the loops of the River Seine that winds for 356km from Normandy to Paris, and there are subtle clues that point to the origins of one of French cuisine's most revered dishes, le canard \u00e0 la presse (pressed duck).\u00a0\nAs I stand on the riverside in the sleepy Normandy town of Duclair, set on one of those meandering bends just 20km from my first destination, the city of Rouen, I can see steep white cliffs towering above the waterway that once sheltered ducks who stopped to rest here on their migration south. En route, I passed the huge Christofle factory, the 200-year-old makers of exquisite cutlery and\u00a0 silverware \u2013 and the famous silver duck press that is key to the dish's great ceremonial service.\nLe canard \u00e0 la presse is an elaborate and macabre dish that is as much about ceremony as flavour. It involves dramatically crushing the carcass of a part-roasted duck in an ornate silver press that extracts the blood and juices, which are then used to cook the decadent \"sauce au sang\" (blood sauce) that is made tableside by the maitre d'. The sauce is immediately served with the tender ducks fillets, with the roasted legs brought out after as a second course.\nHowever,\u00a0 for two years, this most decadent of dishes was absent from menus. In 2022 and 2023, avian flu ravaged the supplies of ducks for restaurants across France, but with careful administration of antibiotics, the poultry is now once again safe to serve across France, including in its homeland of Rouen, which was named a Unesco Creative City of Gastronomy in 2021.\nEating this dish is a chance to experience the pomp and ceremony that set classic French cuisine on the global stage in the late 19th Century, and its tableside preparation offers diners a rare glimpse into the fine art of French cooking, which is usually done in the kitchen. It is still served in the some of the nation's most glamorous dining rooms, as well as specialist restaurants, and there are aficionados who travel the world to try it in new places. It even has its own Order of Canardiers, a kind of guild that protects its heritage. Yet its origins are altogether more humble and have much to do with a particularly fat and blood-filled cross-bred duck.\u00a0\u00a0\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nMeanwhile, in Paris, the most famous address to serve it \u2013 La Tour d'Argent \u2013 on the banks of the Seine, reopened in August 2023 after a two-year renovation, and guests are once again enchanted by the sight of their Premier Maitre de l'Hotel (number one maitre d', to you and me) preparing canard \u00e0 la presse. The restaurant and its duck press is so revered that, back in 2016, La Tour d'Argent auctioned a 19th-Century press for the staggering sum of \u20ac40,000 (they have five other presses for use in the restaurant, including one currently on loan to Paris' Mus\u00e9e de l'Art Decoratifs for their Christofle exhibition, which runs until April 2025).\nYet for a dish that has such prestige, like many French dishes, it has its roots in the countryside. When I arrive at Rouen's smart Hotel de Dieppe for a rendezvous with Josette Cheval, a member of the Order of Canardiers, she tells me how it all started.\u00a0\n\"The chalky cliffs make the climate slightly warmer along the banks of the River Seine and therefore the ducks migrating would stop to rest, meet the local ducks and,\" she claps her hands twice, laughing, \"clack, clack, some little fat ducklings would then arrive!\"\nWe're chatting in the lounge of the hotel, an important address in the history of the dish. Here, \u00a0managing director Julien Marchal-Gu\u00e9ret, the grand-nephew of Michel Gu\u00e9ret who established the Order of Canardiers in 1986, joins us and takes up the story. \"Everything started in the 17th Century, we think, when these ducks were hunted. This fatter, cross-bred duck [which became known as the Duclair duck] has very tender flesh, it's very red and very tasty,\" he says. \"Hunters would make a meal from the ducks whereby they would put the heart and liver into a small bowl, flamb\u00e9e it with Calvados and make a sauce and then dip the fillets into it. It was a little feast in the forest.\"\nFrom there, the recipe became a local dish in Duclair and Rouen, and later, in the late 19th Century, it became a speciality of the long-closed Hotel de la Poste in Duclair thanks to its owner Henri \"P\u00e8re\" Denise, who bought ducks from the market across the river in the village of Anneville-Ambourville.\u00a0\n\"With the wind and the rain of Normandy, the farmers would protect the ducks, perhaps by holding them under their cloaks and they accidentally suffocated,\" says Marchal-Gu\u00e9ret.\nAs gruesome as it sounds, the fact the ducks' blood remained in the carcass added to the tenderness of the meat, and the story goes that P\u00e8re Denise was only too happy to take the suffocated ducks for a bargain price. From then on, this was how the ducks were slaughtered.\u00a0\nMarchal-Gu\u00e9ret's family's part in the story came in the 1930s when his great uncle, Michel Gu\u00e9ret, worked as an apprentice aboard the river cruise-liner, the Felix Faure. \"He was given carte blanche by the captain one evening to cook for the passengers, and he made the dish, making a few changes such as replacing Calvados with cognac and port.\" At the Hotel de Dieppe, it is Marachal-Gu\u00e9ret who does the honours of serving the dish in the small dining room in the restaurant Caf\u00e9 Victor.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\nMy own chance to taste the dish at the Caf\u00e9 Victor that evening is foiled, however, as Cheval and Marchal-Gu\u00e9ret are both attending the initiation of the new members of the Ordre du Canardier, where 19 new members are due to don their medals, mounted on blue-striped ribbons. There are nearly 200 members for the Rouen chapter of the Order \u2013 and \"around 3,000 to 3,500 around the world\", says Marchal-Gu\u00e9re, proudly, noting that his customers also come from far and wide to taste the dish. \"There are fans who come because they want to try all the different variations. And a lot of Parisians just come to Rouen for the day.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nFor a dish prepared with such ceremony, an impressive dining room is surely a must, and there are few that equal the majesty of La Tour d'Argent, a Parisian restaurant with a 400-year history. When I step into the restaurant's sixth-floor dining room, I can't help but gasp at the heart-soaring view \u2013 Notre-Dame Cathedral's spire is newly in situ after the fire and the River Seine parts either side of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9. Light pours in through the full-height windows and reflects from the mirrored ceiling. Each table is laid with white linen and silver Christofle cutlery, charger plates and goblets.\nAlthough La Tour d'Argent's version of the canard \u00e0 la presse has its roots in Rouen, its importance is due to the restaurant's late-19th-Century owner Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Delair who introduced the dish here and, in so doing, opened another chapter in its story. La Tour d'Argent began as an inn in 1582; later that century it is thought to have been the first place in France that the fork was used \u2013 adopted from Italy to save diners dropping food onto their enormous ruffs.\u00a0\nWhere Rouen's version of the sauce, la sauce Rouennaise, has elements that are prepared in the kitchen beforehand, the sauce at La Tour d'Argent is prepared entirely in front of the guest. Premier Maitre de l'Hotel Olivier Jacquin is proud to share the process, explaining that it begins tableside with the carving of the roasted duck.\u00a0\nFirst, he says, the skin is intricately removed with tweezers and then the fillets are sliced from the breast. Next, the duck legs are removed and taken back to the kitchen to be roasted further for the second part of the dish. As I watch, Jacquin places the remaining carcass in the central cavity of the press and turns the wheel, its spout delivering a scarlet drizzle of blood. This is added to the heart and liver in a silver dish atop a silver stove. Next, in goes a glass of the finest cognac and a glass of Madeira wine, and Jacquin whisks it gently over the heat as it thickens \u2013 the blood serving as the emulsifier. Then the brown, velvety sauce is gently spooned over the fillets on their silver platter and served to the table alongside the lightest of pommes souffl\u00e9es (French fried potatoes).\nWhen I taste the duck, the fillets are so tender, I barely need to chew; the sauce is velvety smooth and rich with whispering aromas of cognac and Madeira; and the pommes souffl\u00e9s are the perfect contrast \u2013 the light crispy puffed potato pillows crack on my tongue. This part of the dish would easily be rich and filling enough, but there's more to come. The second course is the roasted legs, which are so delicate that the meat falls apart on the fork. I take each bite with a soup\u00e7on of the accompanying tarragon-flecked, egg yolk-rich B\u00e9arnaise sauce, and I grin with the decadence of it all.\nAs I finish the meal, I am presented with a certificate: every duck served at La Tour d'Argent since 1890 has a number. Mine is 1,190,337, inscribed on a souvenir postcard, the restaurant's name is embossed in silver with a cartoon duck serving a silver cloche. With my waistline bursting, my gaze returns to the view of the River Seine. I conclude that the dish has had quite the journey through four centuries and along the rivers' loops from Duclair, when it was a hunter's feast in the forest.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "There are some surprising impacts of cutting out meat, even for a short period, which can carry on well beyond the end of abstinence.\nIt is widely understood that livestock have a heavy impact on the climate and research indicates that switching to a plant-based diet is one of the most impactful steps individuals can take to reduce their carbon emissions from food. Animal products are responsible for\u00a057% of global food-related emissions, compared with plant-based foods which contribute 29% of the total \u2013 even though animals provide less than one fifth of the world's total energy from food.\nEvery year in January, millions of people worldwide choose to start the year by giving up animal products for the month. Others may choose starting the week with each Monday as a meat-free day, or take part in the no-meat-in-the-daytime initiative Vegan Before 6. Besides these initiatives, there are plenty of year-round efforts to reduce meat intake. The \"less but better\" concept involves eating less meat but ensuring it is more ethically produced. \"Reducetarianism\", meanwhile, involves people simply reducing their meat, dairy and egg intake.\nPeople have many different reasons for reducing their meat consumption, whether for animal welfare, climate or dietary reasons. Regardless of their motivations, a recent study found that low meat diets can be beneficial across a range of environmental reasons, with vegan diets having lower greenhouse gas emissions, lower water use and lower impacts on biodiversity.\nFor those making the switch for only a short period, however, those impacts may initially only be lowered during that time. But there are indications that there could also be some surprising lasting impacts that can go well beyond January, Monday, or whichever time period someone might choose to avoid or cut down on animal products.\nOne of the most well-known campaigns to reduce animal product intake is Veganuary, which encourages people to eat vegan food for the month of January. In 2024, around 25 million people worldwide joined the campaign, according to Veganuary's statistics.\nThe campaign claims that the effects of a month free of animal products can extend beyond January, resulting in longer-term dietary changes. According to its own survey, the Veganuary campaign claims that 81% of participants said they had maintained a significant reduction in meat consumption six months after taking part.\nWhy January (or Monday)?\nThe month of January has more value here than providing the basis for a portmanteau: people show a higher interest in embarking on health drives early in the year. The same goes for early in the week.\n\u00a0\nThere are many reasons why these effects could continue beyond the month. Early research has linked participation with increased experience of \"meat disgust\". A small independent study of 40 participants who normally ate meat found that those who reduced their meat intake in January were more likely to have feelings of disgust towards meat once the month had ended (even though many had lapses). Of the 40 participants, 28 reported an increase in meat disgust.\n\"The more meat people managed to cut out during Veganuary, the more their meat disgust grew over that month,\" says study author Elisa Becker, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the UK. \"When you stop eating meat, that disgust ramps up, which is really interesting. \"This suggests that just one month of meat abstinence changes how you view meat.\"\nBecker has also found a connection between increased meat disgust and reduced meat consumption in a larger six-month study carried out at the University of Exeter in the UK, finding 74% of vegetarians were classified as \"meat disgusted\".\n\"Both studies show a connection between meat intake and meat disgust \u2013 the less meat you eat, the more disgusted by meat you tend to become,\" Becker says.\nThe study didn't examine the reasons why participants chose to give up meat, so it is possible they could have already had some concerns that contributed to preexisting feelings of disgust.\nBecker's findings have, however, been confirmed and expanded by Sophie Hearn and Natalia Lawrence at the University of Exeter in unpublished research recently presented at a conference and seen by the BBC.\n\"This is an emerging area of social science research which seems to be revealing something quite interesting and important in terms of the consequences for meat consumption of the 'practice' or actual experience of cutting back or cutting out meat from your diet, for example by participating in Veganuary,\" says Carol Morris, principal research fellow at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Nottingham in the UK, who has studied less-meat initiatives. \"If you engage in meat reduction or elimination for a period it does seem to change your relationship with that foodstuff.\"\nThe research field is still in its early stages, but Morris suggests the phenomenon is worth further investigation.\n\"This could be some preliminary evidence suggesting that abstention from meat can strengthen disgust towards it,\" says Jared Piazza, a senior lecturer in psychology at Lancaster University in the UK who\u00a0moral decision making as it relates to society, animals, and food.\n\"Ultimately, the relationship between meat abstention and disgust is likely a feedback loop. Avoiding meat over time can re-calibrate your appetite towards meat,\" says Piazza.\"However, research suggests that in the short term, meat eaters who attempt to abstain from meat within a month-long pledge experience greater cravings for meat than meat eaters who don\u2019t abstain. Thus, one shouldn\u2019t expect abstention to lead to meat disgust immediately. It takes a little time.\"\nIn 2023, a team led by Peter Scarborough, professor of population health at the University of Oxford, released a study on the environmental impacts of different diets, which included a large number of vegans and vegetarians from a dataset of 55,000 people in the UK. This real-world data was crucial, Scarborough says. \"Quite often researchers just model what a vegan and vegetarian diet might be and make some kind of crazy assumptions, like saying: 'Oh, well, I'm sure vegans eat just the same as meat eaters, but instead of sausages, they eat broccoli.'\"\nThe analysis was the first to review the impact of diets on a range of environmental measures beyond carbon emissions, including land use, water use, water pollution and loss of species.\nThe research concluded that the vegan diet had the lowest carbon emissions \u2013 just 25% of the greenhouse gas emissions of a diet that includes more than 100g of meat per day. Plant-based diets' lower emissions still held even\u00a0when air miles and the resources taken to grow crops\u00a0were taken into account. The most carbon-intensive vegan diet still had only\u00a037% of the greenhouse gas emissions of the diet\u00a0consisting of more than 100g of meat per day. (Read more about\u00a0the environmental impact of vegan and vegetarian diets here).\nFor those who don't follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, simply eating less meat had a substantial impact on emissions, Scarborough found. On a population level, these reductions are significant. If big meat-eaters in the UK were to cut some of it out of their diet, it would be equivalent to taking eight million cars off the road, according to Scarborough.\nIn 2024, researchers in Scotland found that across the UK, the change that made the biggest difference to total meat consumption was reducing meat portion size. The next most impactful measure was fewer meat-eating days, fewer meat consumers (this includes vegans, vegetarians, flexitarians and people who eat meat sparingly) and finally fewer meat-containing meals (for example, including a vegetarian lunch).\u00a0\nReducing portion size, the researchers say, could be the most impactful action for \"meat-oriented consumers\", who would be unlikely to forego meat entirely for a day each week, or month each year.\nBesides reducing portions, the type of meat and animal products eaten make a difference too. Certain types are lower-carbon than others. Beef has the highest carbon footprint, followed by lamb, as both come from ruminant animals that belch out potent methane when they digest their food. Meat from small, non-ruminant animals, such as chicken, turkey and duck has a much lower carbon footprint. (Read more about which protein-rich foods can help us curb our emissions).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Seven proven ways to help the planet\n\u2022\u00a0The challenge of eating local food on a budget\n\u2022\u00a0The foods that eat up carbon\nScarborough and his colleagues hope their findings will be used to inform public policy. However, he says there is a lack of political appetite inthe UK to introduce meat-reduction policies, which countries such as Denmark have done. Becker agrees there is little public support for meat reduction policies. The meat paradox \u2013 the fact that most people oppose animal mistreatment but still want to eat factory-farmed meat \u2013 means that people tend to rationalise their meat consumption and defend it quite vigorously, she says.\n\"Let's be pragmatic about this,\" says Morris. \"For everyone to become plant-based is probably not realistic.\" And while by far the most impactful dietary change remains to eat a plant-based diet, Morris welcomes other initiatives, from \"less but better\", to cutting out animal products for a time, if these help people reduce their impact on the planet.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Ahead of Kendrick Lamar's headline performance at the Super Bowl half-time show in New Orleans, we explore the rapper's journey from the unforgiving streets of Compton to pop culture ubiquity.\n\"I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death?\" ponders a fiery and fed-up Kendrick Lamar on fan-favourite song Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst. Sounding like he's on his knees pleading to the man in the sky, the always-probing rapper finally answers his own question: \"Maybe it's because I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death!\"\nThe song considers how an inner-city experience within a racially-divided US tends to be based around constantly grappling with feelings of impending doom: a toxic cycle that's difficult to break free of. Filled with chest-deep empathy; a combination of hyper-animated lyrical perspectives (including a hopeless young man lost in gang activity as well as a sexually-abused girl damaged due to the foster care system); and an underlining morose wit, these raw, confessional lyrics signify why the Compton, Los Angeles rapper is regarded as one of hip-hop's greatest ever songwriters.\nThe esteemed North Carolina rap producer 9th Wonder\u00a0\u2013 who composed arguably the 20-time-Grammy-winning MC's most experimental song with the three-act psychodrama of DUCKWORTH\u00a0\u2013 told me back in 2023: \"Kendrick Lamar is more like a documentarian than an MC. Kendrick chooses to rap about everything and everyone across the social strata. People might call it 'woke' or 'deep', but I think of it as straight-up reporting. Some rappers leave out a certain section of people in their lyrics, right? Well, Kendrick tries to rap from everyone's perspective.\"\u00a0\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning artist\u00a0\u2013 who will perform as the half-time headliner for this Sunday's Super Bowl at the New Orleans Superdome, with R&B star SZA confirmed as a guest\u00a0\u2013 is that rare artist capable of making you see through the eyes of a troubled soul searching for salvation (How Much A Dollar Cost? reimagines God as a homeless man on Skid Row; Auntie Diaries considers the struggles of a transgender relative).\nHe can also consistently create loose, trunk-rattling hood anthems (see Money Trees) that convert highly chantable regional slang terms into trending words. For example, aside from a brilliant DJ Mustard beat that sonically feels like a tank blasting out quaking g-funk basslines while riding out to war, it's fair to say Lamar's urgent 2024 single tv off also went viral due to the hilarious yet highly-meme-able way the lead artist screamed out the word: \"Mustarrrrrrrrrddddddddddd!\"\nSuch was the success of this moment that Heinz are releasing a limited run of condiments, essentially turning Lamar's battle cry ad-lib into a slogan to sell mustard for hot dogs. This illustrates how the artist has always been able to consistently juggle rapping about social injustice\u00a0\u2013 even making a song with an earworm refrain (\"We're gonna be alright!\") that became an anthem for the global Black Lives Matter protest movement\u00a0\u2013 with approval from corporate and mainstream America.\nLamar can stand up for women's rights on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage one minute, then insinuate that rap rival Drake had relationships with underage women (something the Canadian artist denies) on a vicious but ubiquitous diss song, which followed a protracted feud between the two rappers, the next.\u00a0Last weekend, Not Like Us won the 2025 Grammy for song of the year; meanwhile Drake has taken legal action against record label Universal Music over the track.\nLamar adopts different guises much like his hero Tupac Shakur, playing both preacher and soldier \u2013 giving weight to both Martin Luther King's pacifism (LOVE), but also Malcolm X's \"by any means necessary\" approach to politics (The Blacker The Berry). It is ultimately this duality and versatility that makes the artist the perfect choice for this Sunday's Super Bowl half-time show, says Marcus J Moore, the music journalist and author behind The Butterfly Effect: How Kendrick Lamar Ignited The Soul of Black America. \"Sadly, there's still a segment of the [American] population that doesn't consider rap a viable genre in music, despite its popularity,\" he tells the BBC. \"Such thinking suggests racism and classism, but with Kendrick Lamar, he's the type of rapper who can make fans out of anyone. He's a rapper's rapper with a pop sensibility on stage. And while he's tremendous on his own, he's also had the benefit of guesting with bigger stars like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. I think Kendrick has done a great job over the years of making himself undeniable.\"\nTo understand what Lamar's upcoming Super Bowl performance might look like, you must go back to the artist's humble origins. Raised on 1612 West 137th Street in Compton, Los Angeles, Lamar was surrounded by a community filled with members of rival gangs the Bloods and the Crips, that always felt on the verge of chaos. One of his earliest memories was of the 1992 Watts riots, which were triggered by anger around the filmed beating of Rodney King by LAPD officers and the fact a trial ultimately failed to result in any tangible convictions. More than 50 people lost their lives because of this uprising.\n\"There was smoke everywhere and my dad had a bunch of stolen car rims [he had looted] in the back seat he took from the Compton Swap Meet,\" Lamar reflected in an interview with Signed Media. \"My pops and my uncle were both involved in the Watts riots! LA is very sensitive and prideful of its people. We literally burned down our old neighbourhoods because of our anger over Rodney King.\"\nThis rebellious spirit seeped directly into Lamar's raps, with the artist getting sharper and sharper with each new mixtape and album release. It was 2011's Section.80 that really turned industry heads, thanks to its playful tongue twisters (Rigamortus) and cryptic revolutionary songs (HiiiPoWeR) that dared people in Compton to \"get off that slave ship [and] build your own pyramids\". Turning the heads of Dr Dre and Interscope Records, Section 80 was quickly followed by Lamar's stunning major label debut LP, 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d city.\nAlmost instantly heralded as a classic, the album's three-dimensional, Dickensian storytelling reflected the tug-of-war experience of Lamar's own childhood, where staying on the righteous path was a constant battle, especially when drive-by shootings were going on outside the family's living room window. One of the key factors that made this Top Dawg Entertainment (the label that also hosts Doechii, SZA, and Schoolboy Q) record so great, according to 9th Wonder, was how it subverted gangsta rap cliches. \"Some rappers do come from good homes with loving moms and dads!\" he says. \"Not everyone comes from a hardback struggle, or has to be a bad kid just because they come from a bad place. Kendrick knows the power of telling simple American stories about ordinary people doing their best.\"\nThe importance of no album sounding the same as the last seemed to be a rule Lamar followed to the letter. In the years that followed his debut, he consistently took bold left turns, experimenting with avant-garde jazz on 2015's To Pimp a Butterfly and a psychedelic stadium rap sound (PRIDE) on 2017's DAMN. Arguably the biggest risk came with 2022's double album Mr Morale & The Big Steppers, where Lamar brutally dissected his own psyche, admitting to cheating on his partner while touring overseas in Scandinavia and urging fans not to treat his raps too much like dissectible prophecies.\n\"The cat is out the bag, I am not your saviour!\" was one of many of this project's fall-on-your-own-sword lyrics, while the sound felt far more wounded and piano-based than previous iterations. With last year's swaggering GNX album, however, Lamar seems to be most preoccupied with having fun, using the project as a victory lap for gutter Los Angeles rap and its ability to \"squabble up\" to invaders. Although it wasn't featured on the project, the aforementioned five-Grammy-winning Drake diss Not Like Us definitely set the sharp-tongued tone that GNX possesses.\u00a0\n\"Artists of Kendrick's stature don't usually rock the boat [and change their sound too radically] once they become famous,\" says Moore. \"But he's done so with many of his releases, no matter how popular the previous albums were. He's encouraged others to take creative risks for their music. I think, more than anything, this courage has helped change popular music.\"\nMoore also credits Lamar's ability to turn big performances into public statements that dominate social media conversation for cultivating such a crossover popularity. For the 2016 Grammys, for example, Lamar's performance evoked the chains of slavery and America's prison-industrial complex, as the rapper tap-danced alongside prisoners. By hiring Lamar, then, the NFL are sure to make an enduring live statement, much as they did with Beyonc\u00e9's Hurricane Katrina-referencing Super Bowl performance from 2016. \"I would prepare for anything!\" predicts Moore. \"If there's any message that could emanate from Kendrick's Super Bowl performance in New Orleans, I think it could be about the wildfires in Los Angeles and the city's resilience.\"\nSeb Joseph, a marketing expert and editor at Digiday, believes the NFL's decision to have Lamar as a half-time performer is supposed to reflect the changing values of their brand and business itself, which has endured accusations of racism in the past. He says it doesn't matter if Lamar doesn't have a song with a catchy chorus embedded as deeply in the collective psyche as say Purple Rain or Crazy in Love, because his selection for the Super Bowl \"isn't a risk \u2013 it's a statement\".\u00a0\nJoseph adds: \"If previous Super Bowl performers like Prince, Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna embodied pop ubiquity, Kendrick represents something just as powerful: cultural gravity. His music isn't always designed for casual singalongs but rather it's built for reflection, resistance and resonance. And in a moment when the NFL is still navigating its own complicated relationship with race, protest and black artistic expression, Kendrick isn't just an artist\u00a0\u2013 they're inviting a movement to the main stage.\"\nLamar may help the NFL with its image problems, but the bigger question mark is around whether he will perform the Drake diss track. For many it's a song that reflected a changing of the guard in mainstream rap supremacy and solidified Lamar at the very top of the competitive ladder. Crowning it the best song of 2024, Pitchfork's Paul A Thompson wrote: \"In the third verse, Kendrick casts Drake as a parasite who leeches off of younger, more inventive rappers in a quest for pyrrhic streaming statements. But by that point he's already turned the biggest pop star on the planet into a punchline.\"\nThe Canadian artist has an ongoing legal action against his and Lamar's shared label Universal Music for releasing the song, but with Not Like Us now a five-time Grammy winner it's hard to imagine it not being performed. Could a half-time Super Bowl performance featuring the song represent a risk to all the lucrative advertisers? Not according to Digiday's Joseph.\n\"The song has transcended the beef. It's fun, it's infectious and it's already been embraced far beyond the hip-hop world. Instead of just a diss track, it's a cultural jolt \u2013 one that taps into regional pride, black joy and the communal energy that makes music feel alive. Brands love to co-opt hip-hop culture when it's convenient. They'll put rap lyrics on ad campaigns or with tweets; partner with artists for limited-edition sneakers' and drop hip-hop-inspired Super Bowl commercials\u00a0\u2013 all while keeping a safe distance from the actual violent tensions that shape the genre.\"\nWith or without Not Like Us making an appearance, Kendrick Lamar is risking a lot by even gracing that stage. \"The Super Bowl half-time show isn't just a performance \u2013 it's the single biggest branding opportunity in music. It's a 12-minute global ad for an artist's catalogue, cultural impact, and marketability, all broadcast to an audience of over 100 million people,\" says Joseph.\u00a0\n\"And here's the kicker: performers don't get paid! Instead, the exposure itself becomes the currency, often translating into massive streaming hikes, album sales and brand deals. Take Rihanna in 2023: her streams rose 640% after her performance, and Fenty Beauty reportedly pulled in more than $5 million in media impact value from that subtle but game-changing mid-show makeup touch up. But with the rewards come massive risks.\"\nJoseph continues: \"The Super Bowl is a high-stakes, zero-margin-for-error stage where the scrutiny is relentless, the expectations sky-high. If an artist miscalculates, whether it's the energy, the production or the cultural moment they're stepping into, the fallout can be brutal.\"\nMoore admits some of Lamar's day one fans might see a contradiction in an artist who has a hit single, Swimming Pools, criticising hip-hop alcoholism also performing at a show where alcohol brands pay millions for advertising slots. His advice? Embrace Lamar for who he is now, not in the past. \"Sure, some of his core fans might see his Super Bowl performance as a sell-out move, but I would encourage those listeners to go back and revisit his 2022 album, Mr Morale & The Big Steppers, where he shot back against the notion of being a paragon of virtue,\" Moore says.\n\"Though listeners may want him to be the same artist and person he was on albums like good kid, m.A.A.d. city and To Pimp a Butterfly, they have to realise that was a decade ago, and if they want that guy, they have to play those albums.\"\u00a0\nWhatever the fallout from Sunday's performance might be, it will at the very least represent something special for the people of Compton, with a good kid from a \"mad city\" rubber-stamping his musical legacy. Joseph just hopes to see Lamar perform Alright, believing the protest song's simple message of perseverance is needed now more than ever before.\nJoseph concludes: \"At a time when history feels like it is repeating itself, when the same battles for justice and dignity are being fought yet again, Kendrick standing on that stage, leading millions in the chorus of \"We gon' be alright,\" would be a powerful message. It would say: 'we're still here\u2026 and we're not going anywhere.'\"\u00a0\nThe Super Bowl LIX takes place on Sunday 9 February.\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "This year's Global Responsible Tourism Award winners demonstrate that travel can be inclusive, climate-friendly, nature-positive and a positive force for local communities.\nCelebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Responsible Tourism Awards are a standard bearer for the positive side of the travel industry. Run by the non-profit International Centre for Responsible Tourism Global, the awards aim to showcase the benefits of tourism and inspire other firms to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nAwards like these are particularly important at a time when tourism is under pressure. With global travel and tourism numbers back to pre-pandemic levels and one in 10 people employed in the industry, the need to improve the sector's environmental, economic and cultural impact is clear. Lifting up businesses that give back to their local communities creates a win-win for tourists and locals alike. And for travellers interested in supporting local culture, having extraordinary nature experiences and a ensuring a responsible travel industry, the winning firms have demonstrated their ability to do that and more.\u00a0\nTess Longfield, head of sustainability communications at Sabre, who sponsors the awards, commented that extraordinary work is being done by all the winners to create a more sustainable and equitable world through tourism. \"It's a testament to the power of responsible travel to make a real difference,\" she said.\nFrom a private ecolodge in South Africa to a volunteering organisation in a Peruvian biosphere reserve, these are the firms to book with in 2024 and beyond:\nThis five-star ecolodge set in 3,500 hectares of South African wilderness is constantly researching pioneering ways of doing things to improve the lives of the local community and protect the fragile landscapes and wildlife that surround it.\nAs well as offering unique tourism experiences to guests, such as guided walks to the flora-rich fynbos and coastal safaris in in waters teeming with great white sharks and dolphins, Grootbos' lodge provides ecotourism jobs to the local community. Profits from the lodge fund the Grootbos Foundation, which gives free skills and business training for hundreds of local people in the areas of hospitality, horticulture, entrepreneurship and biodiversity. It creates a ripple effect that's much needed during a period of serious unemployment in South Africa.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe judging team called Grootbos \"an exemplary business that others can learn from\", praising the way that it constantly pushes the boundaries and explores new ways of developing responsible tourism.\u00a0\n\"Grootbos cares about community and conservation,\" said Phil Murray, fundraising, donor relations and communications manager at Grootbos Foundation. \"Neither can be ignored, and both can mutually benefit from programmes and a responsible tourism business that prizes people and planet.\"\nRajasthan Studio curates art experiences with master artisans in Rajasthan, allowing travellers to experience, understand and value the local culture of the place they are visiting. Travellers can visit master artists at their homes and studios, meet their families, see the process behind making local handicrafts and co-create a personalised souvenir with the crafter.\nThe experiences include an insight into rare and unique art forms like puppetry and the blue pottery of Jaipur, pichwai\u00a0art and sea foam carving of Udaipur, leather juttis and tie dye of Jodhpur and much more. The idea is to build a community of artists and scale the business to different parts of Rajasthan, and eventually across India.\u00a0\n\"Rajasthan as a state is blessed with a wonderful art heritage and travellers are eager to explore every bit of it,\" said company founder Kartik Gaggar. \"But why should we limit it to exploring? We asked the same question and the answer was: let's turn it into an experience.\"\u00a0\nThe judges were impressed with how Gaggar has created an immersive cultural experience that both economically benefits artists and enriches travellers. They called it a \"highly replicable approach\".\nToday, the company offers more than 20 hand-on art experiences in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, with plans to include artists from Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Bundi and Kota in the near future.\nAs this year's protests have been demonstrating, tourism has an impact on local people as much as visitors. Sivatel Bangkok was this year's winner for its innovative approach that brings together local providers to directly help the community.\nThe hotel sources 70% of its ingredients organically and partners with more than 50 local farmers through the Sivatel's Farmer Friends Network. It also supports local producers and fosters a sustainable ecosystem through the \"Sivatel Sustainable Market\", a pop-up market within the hotel where local artisans and food producers can sell their wares to travellers. Uniforms are designed by Folkcharm, a local sustainable fashion brand that supports local artisans.\nPerhaps most uniquely, it runs a \"From Kitchen to Chicken\" programme, diverting hotel food scraps to feed black soldier fly larvae, which are then used as protein for organic chickens at a local chicken farm, where the hotel then sources its meat.\nThe judging panel found Sivatel Bangkok's structured programme based around regenerative agriculture and funding impressive, along with the way it sources and trains local providers.\u00a0\n\"We believe that to live on this Earth, we cannot live alone but must support each other,\" said Sivatel CEO Alisara Sivayathorn.\nWith a business that serves more than six million holidaymakers a year, TUI is one of the best-known tourism brands in Europe. Its deep and comprehensive commitment to inclusivity impressed the judges: the tour operator has devised a unique way to help those with access needs book their accommodations.\nAmong TUI's many initiatives, they have 90 dedicated agents in their contact centre who have had specialist accessibility training; the team has partnered with AccessAble to survey hotels and develop detailed access guides; and also works with Sign Live to provide interpreting services for British Sign Language Users.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022\u00a0The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\n\"Around one in four of the UK population lives with a disability or condition that impacts their daily life,\" said Marina Snellenberg, TUI's accessibility manager, \"and the prevalence of disability rises sharply with age. It's important that TUI consider the needs and expectations of the disabled community, allowing for a sustained and deliverable customer experience for years to come.\"\u00a0\nJudges were pleased to see a major tour operator address the needs of those with access needs so comprehensively, and hope that others will follow their example.\nThis award celebrates a small hotel group in Sri Lanka that is actively decarbonising its operations, showing that even smaller players can take meaningful steps towards sustainability and inspire others while doing so.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a tropical climate like Sri Lanka, air conditioning can consume up to 60% of a hotel's energy needs. Across its 19 hotels, Jetwing Hotels uses renewable energy from biomass, solar PV, solar thermal and biogas for power. In 2023, the hotel group generated the equivalent of the power needed for about 13,490 households through renewable energy alone. The company has also shortened its supply chain, reducing transport emissions, and is now sourcing 40% of their inputs locally to their hotels.\n\"By reducing energy costs and promoting a culture of environmental responsibility among our staff and guests, we ensure that our business practices are not only beneficial for the environment but also economically viable,\" said managing director Dmitri Cooray, \"Our success shows that even the smallest efforts can create a ripple effect, encouraging others to make impactful changes.\"\nThe award founders believe that the travel industry has a responsibility to contribute to the reversal of biodiversity loss and protect nature for future generations by promoting a regenerative approach to tourism. CREES, a Peruvian company offering tours and volunteering opportunities in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, is this year's winner of the Nature Positive award.\nThis educational tourism operation is working to benefit local people and conserve biodiversity at its three research stations in the Manu National Park that are home to one of the longest running and largest biodiversity studies in the Amazon. Guests get to witness conservation efforts first hand, exploring the rainforest in the company of the centre's naturalist guides, and participating in ongoing projects like checking pitfall traps, monitoring birdlife and taking visual surveys of reptiles and amphibians at night. Many of the projects monitor the life of the forest in newly regenerated forest areas, replanted by the team's conservationists, as a way to understand species recovery.\u00a0\nJudges were particularly impressed by how CREES approaches its work, citing its broad and holistic agenda aimed at promoting sustainable alternatives that respect human rights, intergenerational rights, biodiversity rights and the rights of species to ensure long-term sustainable economic development, as key factors in its win.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Tumbling stock market values and wild claims have accompanied the release of a new AI chatbot by a small Chinese company. What makes it so different?\nThe release of China's new DeepSeek AI-powered chatbot app has rocked the technology industry. It quickly overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free iOS app in the US, and caused chip-making company Nvidia to lose almost $600bn (\u00a3483bn) of its market value in one day \u2013 a new US stock market record.\nThe reason behind this tumult? The \"large language model\" (LLM) that powers the app has reasoning capabilities that are comparable to US models such as OpenAI's o1, but reportedly requires a fraction of the cost to train and run.\nAnalysis\nDr Andrew Duncan is the director of science and innovation fundamental AI at the Alan Turing Institute in London, UK.\nDeepSeek claims to have achieved this by deploying several technical strategies that reduced both the amount of computation time required to train its model (called R1) and the amount of memory needed to store it. The reduction of these overheads resulted in a dramatic cutting of cost, says DeepSeek. R1's base model V3 reportedly required 2.788 million hours to train (running across many graphical processing units \u2013 GPUs \u2013 at the same time), at an estimated cost of under $6m (\u00a34.8m), compared to the more than $100m (\u00a380m) that OpenAI boss Sam Altman says was required to train GPT-4.\nDespite the hit taken to Nvidia's market value, the DeepSeek models were trained on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to one research paper released by the company. These chips are a modified version of the widely used H100 chip, built to comply with export rules to China. These were likely stockpiled before restrictions were further tightened by the Biden administration in October 2023, which effectively banned Nvidia from exporting the H800s to China. It is likely that, working within these constraints, DeepSeek has been forced to find innovative ways to make the most effective use of the resources it has at its disposal.\nReducing the computational cost of training and running models may also address concerns about the environmental impacts of AI. The data centres they run on have huge electricity and water demands, largely to keep the servers from overheating. While most technology companies do not disclose the carbon footprint involved in operating their models, a recent estimate puts ChatGPT's monthly carbon dioxide emissions at over 260 tonnes per month \u2013 that's the equivalent of 260 flights from London to New York. So, increasing the efficiency of AI models would be a positive direction for the industry from an environmental point of view.\nOf course, whether DeepSeek's models do deliver real-world savings in energy remains to be seen, and it's also unclear if cheaper, more efficient AI could lead to more people using the model, and so an increase in overall energy consumption.\nIf nothing else, it could help to push sustainable AI up the agenda at the upcoming Paris AI Action Summit so that AI tools we use in the future are also kinder to the planet.\nWhat has surprised many people is how quickly DeepSeek appeared on the scene with such a competitive large language model \u2013 the company was only founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, who is now being hailed in China as something of an \"AI hero\".\nThe latest DeepSeek model also stands out because its \"weights\" \u2013 the numerical parameters of the model obtained from the training process \u2013 have been openly released, along with a technical paper describing the model's development process. This enables other groups to run the model on their own equipment and adapt it to other tasks.\nThis relative openness also means that researchers around the world are now able to peer beneath the model's bonnet to find out what makes it tick, unlike OpenAI's o1 and o3 which are effectively black boxes. But there are still some details missing, such as the datasets and code used to train the models, so groups of researchers are now trying to piece these together.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0DeepSeek v ChatGPT \u2013 how do they compare?\n\u2022\u00a0When an AI companion wants something more\n\u2022\u00a0Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?\nNot all of DeepSeek's cost-cutting techniques are new either \u2013 some have been used in other LLMs. In 2023, Mistral AI openly released its Mixtral 8x7B model which was on par with the advanced models of the time. Mixtral and the DeepSeek models both leverage the \"mixture of experts\" technique, where the model is constructed from a group of much smaller models, each having expertise in specific domains. Given a task, the mixture model assigns it to the most qualified \"expert\".\nDeepSeek has even revealed its unsuccessful attempts at improving LLM reasoning through other technical approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search, an approach long touted as a potential strategy to guide the reasoning process of an LLM. Researchers will be using this information to investigate how the model's already impressive problem-solving capabilities can be even further enhanced \u2013 improvements that are likely to end up in the next generation of AI models.\nSo what does this all mean for the future of the AI industry?\nDeepSeek is potentially demonstrating that you don't need vast resources to build sophisticated AI models. My guess is that we'll start to see highly capable AI models being developed with ever fewer resources, as companies figure out ways to make model training and operation more efficient.\nUp until now, the AI landscape has been dominated by \"Big Tech\" companies in the US \u2013 Donald Trump has called the rise of DeepSeek \"a wake-up call\" for the US tech industry. But this development may not necessarily be bad news for the likes of Nvidia in the long term: as the financial and time cost of developing AI products reduces, businesses and governments will be able to adopt this technology more easily. That will in turn drive demand for new products, and the chips that power them \u2013 and so the cycle continues.\nIt seems likely that smaller companies such as DeepSeek will have a growing role to play in creating AI tools that have the potential to make our lives easier. It would be a mistake to underestimate that.\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Without this motion, Earth would die and become more like barren Mars which lost its magnetic field billions of years ago.\nThe change in shape could be happening where the edge of the solid inner core touches the extremely hot liquid metal outer core.\nThe research is published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists were originally trying to find out why the inner core may have slowed down to a slower pace than Earth's rotation before speeding back up again in 2010.\nUnderstanding how the Earth's core works is essential to understanding the magnetic field that protects the planet, and whether that could weaken or stop.\nThe inside of our planet is an extremely mysterious place. The core is about 4,000 miles from the Earth's surface and, despite best efforts, scientists have so far been unable to reach it.\nSo, to try to unlock its secrets, some researchers measure the shockwaves caused by earthquakes as they ripple through the planet.\nThe way the waves travel reveals what type of material they moved through, including in the inner core, and help to paint a picture of what lies beneath our feet.\nThe new analysis looked at seismic wave patterns from earthquakes that repeated  in the same location between 1991 and 2023. That helped to show how the inner core is changing over time.\nProf Vidale, an earth scientist at the University of Southern California, found more evidence to back up the theory that during those years the inner core slowed down around 2010.\nBut his team also found the evidence of the inner core's changing shape. \nIt appears to be happening at the boundary of the inner and outer core, where the inner core is close to melting point. The liquid flow of the outer core as well as pull from an uneven gravity field may cause deformation.\nProf Hrvoje Tkalcic from Australian National University, who was not involved in the study, said the paper provides \"an interesting concept that should be explored further\".\nHe said it could allow scientists \"to make more informed estimates of some important material properties, such as the viscosity of the inner core, which is one of the least known quantities in modern science\".\nOver time the liquid outer core is freezing into the solid inner core, but it will be billions of years before it becomes completely solid.\nIt would almost certainly mean the end of life on Earth, but by then the planet is already likely to have been swallowed by the Sun.\nProf Vidale's work is part of investigations by experts around the world exploring and arguing over what happens in the core.\n\"In science, we generally try to look at things until we understand them,\" Prof Vidale says.\n\"In all likelihood, this finding doesn't affect our daily lives one iota, but we really want to understand what's happening in the middle of the Earth,\" he adds.\nIt is possible that the changes are connected to changes in Earth's magnetic field.\n\"The magnetic field has had jerks at various times in the past few decades, and we'd like to know if that is related to what we're seeing at the inner core boundary,\" he said.\nProf Vidale urged caution about hyping the findings into ideas that the core is going to stop rotating any time soon. \nHe also added that there are still lots of uncertainties.\n\"We're not 100% sure we're interpreting these changes correctly,\" saying that the boundaries of scientific knowledge are always changing and, like many if not all researchers, he has been wrong in the past.",

After moving to Virginia in 2019 on a Saudi government scholarship to study at George Mason University, Eden made the decision in early 2022 to transition from presenting as a man to presenting as a woman, by wearing feminine clothes and taking female sex hormones.\nEden found a community on X and Discord where she felt accepted and started to grow a following online. In one post, she shared a picture of her Saudi ID photo next to her new feminine look and the post went viral.\nBeing transgender in Saudi Arabia is not tolerated by either society or the government - we have spoken to several transgender Saudis, now living outside the kingdom, who told us about the harassment, and in some cases violence, they had experienced.\nReturning to Saudi Arabia could therefore have been difficult for Eden. We understand her student visa expired at around the time of her viral tweet so she decided to seek asylum in the US in order to stay there permanently.\nEden said she was messaged by an old friend who put her in contact with an American private investigator Michael Pocalyko. He offered to help with her asylum claim, and mend the relationship with her family - according to another friend, Hayden, who Eden was living with in Georgia at the time.\nOther friends have shared messages with us from Eden, which say Mr Pocalyko told her she needed to move from Georgia to Washington DC in order to lodge her claim.\nAccording to the final message she posted on X, in late October 2022, the private investigator met Eden off the train in the US capital. He was accompanied by a Saudi lawyer named Bader, she wrote.\n\"I genuinely was optimistic and believed this could work,\" Eden said in her final post. She said Bader put her up in a nice apartment near Washington DC and took her sightseeing.\nBut over time it seems she began to question his motives. Eden wrote to friends, in messages shared with the BBC, that Bader was \"detransitioning\" her. She told them that Bader tried to throw out all of her feminine clothing and told her to stop hormone therapy.\nEden also told friends that Bader advised her she could not apply for asylum in the US and that she must return to Saudi Arabia to do this. A US immigration expert said such advice would be incorrect.\nIn December 2022, Eden messaged friends to say: \"I am going [back to Saudi] with a lawyer and wishing for the best.\" Her suicide note on X makes clear that the lawyer in question was someone called \"Bader\".\nIt was not long before Eden was telling friends that returning was a mistake.\nShe messaged them to say her parents had taken her passport and the government had instructed her to close her X account. Eden told friends she had evidence her parents had hired people to get her back to Saudi Arabia, though she never shared that evidence.\n\"The lawyer that was helping me with asylum was working with my parents behind my back,\" she told one of them.\nOver the next few months, Eden's friends say, she lost any hope of escaping Saudi Arabia.\nShe worked in a junior position at a tech company and in public assumed her original male identity. Eden messaged a friend to say she was trying to continue taking female hormones, but that her parents repeatedly confiscated them. Eden told friends that she suffered constant verbal abuse, and sent the friends a video - which we have seen - that she secretly recorded of a family member shouting that she had been brainwashed by Western ideas.\nEden took her own life on 12 March 2023.\nWe wanted to find \"Bader\" - the lawyer who Eden accused of detransitioning her and persuading her home, to ask him more about the events running up to her death. \nWe searched for lawyers of that name in the DC area, and one came up: Bader Alomair. There was limited information about him online, but an outdated directory for professionals working in Riyadh gave his full name in Arabic - which in turn led us to an inactive Facebook account showing a photo of him at Harvard Law School.\nIn texts Eden sent to friends, she mentioned her lawyer had been Harvard-educated.\nThen, a source shared a crucial photo - taken by Eden from the apartment Mr Alomair had installed her in. We were able to geolocate it to a residential block on the outskirts of Washington DC.\nOne person there told us he had known Eden and had seen her with Mr Alomair.\nHe said Eden owned feminine clothing, jewellery and make-up, but would have to hide it when Mr Alomair came over. He made her cut her hair and told her not to shave, the witness said.\nWe repeatedly tried to contact Mr Alomair, but he did not respond. When we visited the address listed on his DC Bar registration, we saw a man matching photos of him get into an SUV and drive away.\nWe followed, noting the car's unusual number plate - its code indicated the car was issued by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, and that the vehicle's owner was embassy staff.\nMr Alomair's role in the embassy was to support Saudi students in the US - a lawyer who previously worked with him told us.\nWe discovered news articles highlighting instances of Mr Alomair helping those left homeless by a hurricane in Florida, for example. But we also discovered his assistance had extended to more controversial situations.\nOn 13 October 2018, two Saudi students were questioned by US police over the death of an aspiring rapper in North Carolina - stabbed, reportedly after an altercation with the pair.\nSome two months later, Abdullah Hariri and Sultan Alsuhaymi were charged with murder, but by then had left the US.\nJust four days after the stabbing, Mr Hariri was on a flight back to Saudi Arabia, an email shared with us suggests. It includes details of the flights home which our source told us Mr Alomair organised for both Mr Hariri and Mr Alsuhaymi.\nNeither student has ever commented publicly on the case.\nMr Alomair was sent an invoice for the flights a month later, another email shows, which our source says he would have needed to get reimbursement from the Saudi embassy.\nAnother source says he has worked with him to represent dozens of other Saudi students in the US against charges ranging from speeding to drink-driving.\n\"Bader would come to the meetings with an Arabic form headed by the Saudi embassy for students to sign [which] promised to pay back legal fees to the Saudi government once they returned home.\"\nThe source told us the students would appear at their first hearing but vanish before any subsequent hearings, though we do not know if Mr Alomair had any role in this.\nIn 2019, the FBI warned that Saudi officials likely facilitated the escape of Saudi citizens from US legal proceedings.\n\"The FBI assesses that Kingdom of Saudi Arabia officials almost certainly assist US-based Saudi citizens to avoid legal issues, undermining the US judicial process. This assessment is made with high confidence.\"\nSources have told us Mr Alomair continues to live and work in the US. He owns multiple commercial properties around Washington DC and in August 2024 appears to have set up a new law firm in Virginia, where he is a named partner.\nMichael Pocalyko, Bader Alomair and the Saudi embassy in Washington DC did not respond to our questions.\nWe contacted Eden's family to ask if they wanted to take part in this story but they did not respond.\nBBC 100 Women names 100 inspiring and influential women around the world every year.

        "article_text": "Kendrick Lamar's show-stopping performance at Super Bowl on Sunday was, for many, a victory lap following his knock-out blow in a long-running beef with fellow rapper Drake.\nThe Compton star's entire half-time set seemed to swiftly build to a performance of Not Like Us, his Grammy-winning takedown of Drake which was one of last year's biggest hits... but is also now the subject of a potential libel case brought by the Canadian.\nDrake was performing in Australia on Sunday, dishing out cash to several of his fans at a Melbourne show, before the whole world tuned in to watch his rival.\nThe origins of the argument go back more than decade. But here's a quick reminder of where we are now and how we got here over a heated 12 months:\nIn March last year, producer and former Drake collaborator Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.\nHidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.\nIn it, Lamar took aim at rapper J Cole's previous claim - that himself, Kendrick and Drake were \"the big three\" - proclaiming: \"[forget] the big three - it's just big me\".\nAfter years of tension, the fuse had been lit.\n\nSoon after, Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse at a concert in Florida.\nHe told the crowd: \"I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"\nTwo weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".\nSpeaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.\nDrake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.\n\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.\nHe also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.\nMore rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.\nThe Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.\nWhat's more he used artificial intelligence to deliver the insults in the voices of Lamar's heroes, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg.\nLamar finally responded with a full-blown, six-minute riposte on record.\nTitled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it saw him brand Drake as \"predictable\", a \"master manipulator\" and a \"habitual liar\",  while calling his sparring partner's parenting skills into question.\n\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"\nLess than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.\nIn it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.\n\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"\nIn May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.\nOn the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).\nWithin 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".\nEach verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.\nAmong the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.\nDrake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".\nBut the Californian wasn't finished and he dropped a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.\n\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" he rapped.\nDrake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof.\n\"Drake is not a name that you gonn' see on no sex offender list, easy does it / You mentioning A minor \u2026 B sharp and tell the fans: Who was it?\"\nLamar's pop-orientated Not Like Us became a big summer club hit - picking up 21 million streams in its first three days of release.\nIt went on to earn one billion streams on Spotify and later five Grammy Awards, at last month's ceremony, including song of the year.\nThings took a darker turn, when a security guard outside Drake's house was shot although there is no proof it was connected to the rappers' feud. However, the vandalism of Drake's OVO shop in London apparently was.\nAt one star-studded gig in Los Angeles in June, which was intended as a show of unity for the West Coast rap fraternity, Lamar played his biggest diss track five times.\n\nFast forward to January this year, and Drake decided to sue the Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us.\nIn papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".\nIn response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".\nIt also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.\n\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.\n\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"\nWhich brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\" \nIn the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.\nLamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.\nWhen the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"\nThat lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.\nIn playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.\nThe performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.\nWilliams, a Compton kid like Kendrick, performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as the headliner prowled the stage.\nIn a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".\nWhile over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.\nOn Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025.",

        "article_text": "Three Ghanaians have told the BBC of their involvement in the fighting between Islamist insurgents and the military in neighbouring Burkina Faso, describing scenes of sometimes indiscriminate violence and bloody battles.\n\"We are always with the dead. In some battles, I've seen 40, 50 or 100 dead people,\" one of the men told the BBC.\nThe three, all in their late thirties or early forties, said they had fought in Burkina Faso multiple times since 2018. They crossed the porous 550km-long (340-mile) border between the two countries, without being detected by the security forces.\nThey denied being primarily motivated by religion or being trained by the jihadists, saying they went to fight to defend civilian communities with whom they had strong family and ethnic ties.\n\"My elder brother, his wife and children were all killed by the [Burkinabe] army. It pains me a lot. The military came to their community in the forest. They killed all of them, a whole household, including 29 people,\" one of the men said.\nBut another of the men did articulate religious zeal, saying: \"If you die while fighting with the jihadists, then you are driving to jannah (an Islamic word for paradise), on the path of the righteous.\"\nChallenged over whether they had taken part in civilian attacks, the men were divided. \nOne denied doing so, but another conceded that he did. \n\"Some local people support the military in attacking us, that's why we have to kill them too,\" he said.\n\"You know... I'm not happy to fight like this. The number of people we kill, the people the military kill, it's very bad. But this fight has entered our blood,\" he added.\nAll three spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe BBC was unable to confirm their claims but they showed us pictures of weapons, described the location of recent conflicts and named jihadist commanders in Burkina Faso.\nThe BBC was put in touch with the men through contacts at cattle markets in northern Ghana, where jihadist groups are alleged to be recruiting fighters.\nIn 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.\nAnd the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank, in a report released last July, said the jihadists  had \"minimal success\" recruiting in Ghana. \nHowever, the men offered a different perspective, telling the BBC, in claims that could not be verified, that people from \"all parts of Ghana\" and from \"many\" ethnic groups were joining the insurgency in Burkina Faso.\n\"Some are fighting for jihad. Some are doing it for business,\" one of them said.\nThe financial incentive comes in the form of the plentiful livestock that the jihadists steal from communities driven out of their villages.\n\"When we attack a community, we take their animals: sometimes 50, sometimes 100,\" the BBC was told by one of the men.\nThe cattle are allegedly brought to northern Ghana, and sold at markets. \nThe trafficking across the border was confirmed to the BBC by cattle dealers.\nIt is thought to have become a major income stream for groups like Jama'at Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate that is the most active jihadist group in Burkina Faso. It also operates in Niger and Mali. \nThe West African region was described by the UN last year as the epicentre of global jihadist violence.\nAid agencies say that over the last decade some two-million people have been displaced by the insurgency in Burkina Faso and tens of thousands killed.\nNinpoa Nasuri is one of the thousands who have fled to Ghana to escape the violence.\nShe told the BBC her husband was killed in front of her in 2024 during a raid on their village in eastern Burkina Faso by fighters from JNIM.\n\"They grabbed the men, and they beat them to death. My husband was a farmer. He had nothing to do with the government militia or the conflict,\" she told the BBC. \nOther refugees described similar acts of violence by the Burkinabe military.\n\"Some of the people they were killing were aged 80, aged 90. These people can't hold a gun, can't fight with anybody. They killed them for no reason,\" Saafiya Karim said. \nGhana has so far remained largely untouched by the insurgency, although some attacks have taken place in neighbouring Togo and Ivory Coast. \nIn a recent statement to Ghanaian journalist Mohammed Eliasu Tanko, a man calling himself a representative of JNIM said the group had no interest in launching attacks in Ghana.\n\"They (JNIM fighters) are not allowed to take any action against Ghana. This is a clear and certain statement. JNIM do not seek war against Ghana,\" the man, known as Ansari, said in the statement, which the BBC has seen.\nHowever an upsurge in communal violence in one part of northern Ghana has raised concerns that the jihadists are trying to exploit the conflict to their advantage. \nThe town of Bawku is embroiled in a decades-long struggle between different ethnic groups for control of the local chieftaincy. More than 100 people are thought to have been killed in clashes since fighting intensified in last October.\n\"The evening in Bawku is always [one of] gunshots and fierce exchanges. People use AK47s, M16s, all kinds of automatic rifles,\" a resident told the BBC.\nJNIM smugglers are accused of selling weapons to both sides.\n\"We understand they are supplying weapons that they have taken from the military in Burkina Faso. They do this by relying on the trucks that travel up to Niger and back carrying onions. They hide the weapons inside those trucks,\" Tanko told the BBC. \n\"One intelligence officer confirmed to me this was the new way they are bringing firearms in. And the Ghanaian security are ill-equipped to be able to detect these vehicles coming through, putting Ghana in a very critical situation,\" he added.\nGhana's Defence Minister Edward Omane Boamah did not respond to a BBC request for comment. \nPresident John Mahama, who took office in January after winning December's presidential election, visited Bawku last month in an effort to promote peace between the rival groups. However,  gunfights continue to be reported. \nGhana's governing party spokesman Sammy Gyamfi told the BBC that ending the violence in Bawku was the government's \"number one priority\".\n\"The violence is already spreading and if care is not taken it's likely that insurgents from the wider region can take advantage of this conflict,\" he said.\nThe three men the BBC spoke to said they did not rule out the possibility of the insurgency spreading.\n\"This thing can go to any place, or to any country. It didn't exist in Togo but now the attacks are happening there. If they can go to Togo, they can get to Ghana. This thing is strong, it's powerful,\" one of them said.\nBut another of the men took a cynical perspective, saying the insurgents in Burkina Faso were no longer waging an \"Islamic struggle\". \n\"They just kill the people, and steal their livestock. What is happening is not jihad and so I do not like it,\" he said. \nYou can listen to Ed Butler's report on the BBC World Service's Assignment programme.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US has sparked several legal challenges and some anxiety among immigrant families.\nFor nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen.\nBut as part of his crackdown on migrant numbers, Trump is seeking to deny citizenship to children of migrants who are either in the country illegally or on temporary visas. \nThe move appears to have public backing. A poll by Emerson College suggests many more Americans back Trump than oppose him on this. \nBut how does this compare to citizenship laws around the world?\nBirthright citizenship, or jus soli (right of the soil), is not the norm globally.\nThe US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.\nIn contrast, many countries in Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa adhere to the jus sanguinis (right of blood) principle, where children inherit their nationality from their parents, regardless of their birthplace. \nOther countries have a combination of both principles, also granting citizenship to children of permanent residents.\nJohn Skrentny, a sociology professor at the University of California, San Diego, believes that, though birthright citizenship or jus soli is common throughout the Americas, \"each nation-state had its own unique road to it\".\n\"For example, some involved slaves and former slaves, some did not. History is complicated,\" he says. In the US, the 14th Amendment was adopted to address the legal status of freed slaves.\nHowever, Mr Skrentny argues that what almost all had in common was \"building a nation-state from a former colony\".\n\"They had to be strategic about whom to include and whom to exclude, and how to make the nation-state governable,\" he explains. \"For many, birthright citizenship, based on being born in the territory, made for their state-building goals.\n\"For some, it encouraged immigration from Europe; for others, it ensured that indigenous populations and former slaves, and their children, would be included as full members, and not left stateless. It was a particular strategy for a particular time, and that time may have passed.\"\nIn recent years, several countries have revised their citizenship laws, tightening or revoking birthright citizenship due to concerns over immigration, national identity, and so-called \"birth tourism\" where people visit a country in order to give birth.\nIndia, for example, once granted automatic citizenship to anyone born on its soil. But over time, concerns over illegal immigration, particularly from Bangladesh, led to restrictions.\nSince December 2004, a child born in India is only a citizen if both parents are Indian, or if one parent is a citizen and the other is not considered an illegal migrant.\nMany African nations, which historically followed jus soli under colonial-era legal systems, later abandoned it after gaining independence. Today, most require at least one parent to be a citizen or a permanent resident.\nCitizenship is even more restrictive in most Asian countries, where it is primarily determined by descent, as seen in nations such as China, Malaysia, and Singapore.\nEurope has also seen significant changes. Ireland was the last country in the region to allow unrestricted jus soli. \nIt abolished the policy after a June 2004 poll, when 79% of voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring at least one parent to be a citizen, permanent resident, or legal temporary resident. \nThe government said change was needed because foreign women were travelling to Ireland to give birth in order to get an EU passport for their babies.\nOne of the most severe changes occurred in the Dominican Republic, where, in 2010, a constitutional amendment redefined citizenship to exclude children of undocumented migrants.\nA 2013 Supreme Court ruling made this retroactive to 1929, stripping tens of thousands - mostly of Haitian descent - of their Dominican nationality. Rights groups warned that this could leave many stateless, as they did not have Haitian papers either.\nThe move was widely condemned by international humanitarian organisations and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\nAs a result of the public outcry, the Dominican Republic passed a law in 2014 that established a system to grant citizenship to Dominican-born children of immigrants, particularly favouring those of Haitian descent.\nMr Skrentny sees the changes as part of a broader global trend. \"We are now in an era of mass migration and easy transportation, even across oceans. Now, individuals also can be strategic about citizenship. That's why we are seeing this debate in the US now.\"\nWithin hours of President Trump's order, various lawsuits were launched by Democratic-run states and cities, civil rights groups and individuals.\nTwo federal judges have sided with plaintiffs, most recently District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland on Wednesday. \nShe sided with five pregnant women who argued that denying their children citizenship violated the US Constitution.\nMost legal scholars agree that President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.\nUltimately this will be decided by the courts, said Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. \"This is not something he can decide on his own.\"\nThe order is now on hold as the case makes it through the courts.\nIt is unclear how the Supreme Court, where conservative justices form a supermajority,  would interpret the 14th Amendment if it came to it. \nTrump's justice department has argued it only applies to permanent residents. Diplomats, for example, are exempt.\nBut others counter that other US laws apply to undocumented migrants so the 14th Amendment should too.",

        "article_text": "Fingernails help protect the underlying skin from injury, and they also come in handy when you want to scratch an itch or peel a satsuma. But what do they reveal about your health?\n*\u00a0All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional. The BBC is not responsible or liable for any diagnosis made by a user based on the content of this site. The BBC is not liable for the contents of any external internet sites listed, nor does it endorse any commercial product or service mentioned or advised on any of the sites. Always consult your own GP if you're in any way concerned about your health.\u00a0\nThere's no shortage of folk wisdom about how to glean the state of your overall health from your nails, such as the pervasive idea that the white flecks that sometimes turn up \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are a sign of calcium deficiency. But is there any truth to these ideas?\nFirst up some basic anatomy. Nails are an extension of the skin. They are made from keratin, a super tough protein that shields the toes and tops of your fingers from trauma. The half-moon shape seen at the base of the nail is the lunula, which serves as the \"growth centre\" for the nail, producing the cells that will eventually harden into the nail plate . It sits above the cuticle, a layer of dead cells joining the base of the nailbed to the skin. The cuticle offers extra protection by acting as the nail's security guard, stopping bacteria, fungi and other pathogens in their tracks.\nWhile the eyes might be the windows to the soul, to a doctor the nails can be the windows to your health. Physicians can use them to diagnose all sorts of conditions, from dermatological problems to kidney disease or even autoimmune disorders.\n\"One of the first things I learned in medical school was to look for something called clubbing, where there is this loss of the angle between the nail and the nail bed itself,\" says Dan Baumgardt, a general practitioner in medicine and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol.\u00a0\nWith clubbing, the nail beds soften, and the nails almost seem to \"float\" instead of being firmly attached to the finger. The fingertips also appear large or bulging. \"It causes an unusual sort of swollen finger appearance where the finger looks a little bit like a drumstick,\" says Baumgardt.\nClubbing is a sign of extremely low blood oxygen levels. It is most commonly associated with lung cancer, but it can also indicate an infection of the lining of the heart chambers and heart valves, among other things. Other conditions where it is observed include celiac disease, cirrhosis of the liver and lung infections amongst others.\n\"If you do see a patient with clubbing the rule of thumb is to get them an x-ray as an urgency, because it could be an underlying lung cancer that could be explaining it,\" says Baumgardt. \"Having said that even though it's one of the first things that we learned in medical school. I really don't know why, because in all the 14 years I've been a doctor, I've only ever seen it once,\" he says.\nWhite flecks on the nail \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are often touted to be a sign of vitamin or mineral deficiencies. However, the evidence to support this is mixed. In one small study of undergraduates, there was no correlation between this symptom and a person's intake of either zinc or calcium. However, in one case report of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe leukonychia on his fingernails while deficient in selenium, it disappeared after treatment with this mineral.\nIn general, leukonychia are more likely to be a result of nail trauma. Stubbing your toe, trapping your fingernail in a door, too many manicures, or dropping a heavy object on your foot may cause such a mark.\nNevertheless, white discolouration on the nail could suggest an underlying health issue. For instance, white marks can be a sign of heavy metal poisoning with lead or arsenic. White discolouration of the nail could be a sign of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition that causes raised, inflamed, scaly patches of skin. If the entire nail turns white, this could suggest a deficiency of protein in the bloodstream, which can indicate kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If people have low protein levels in their bloodstream it [often] causes the whole nail to go white,\" says Baumgardt. \"We tend to associate that with people who've got liver disease, so things like cirrhosis of the liver, perhaps as a result of alcoholism.\"\u00a0\nBlue nails, on the other hand, are a sign that the body might be lacking oxygen. It could be a sign of serious heart disease or emphysema and is something you should get checked out by a doctor as soon as possible. This is also the case if you see dark lines underneath the nail, as although this can be caused by trauma, it could also be a sign of subungual melanoma, a rare but serious type of skin cancer.\nBleeding beneath the nail \u2013 if it doesn't heal \u2013 could also indicate something more serious. \"You can get what we call splinter haemorrhages, which look like little red streaks of blood, similar to if you imagine a splinter stuck under your nail,\" says Baumgardt. \"That haemorrhage can sometimes be suggestive of vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. One of the main underlying causes can be an infection of the heart valve, which causes these odd little red swellings,\" he says.\nOther, more common conditions can also be diagnosed by looking at the nails. When examining a patient, doctors typically look for alterations in colour, thickness and shape.\nFor example, in a healthy nail the underlying nail bed should be pink except for the white tips. Other colours could indicate an infection of the nail itself, or an underlying health condition.\n\"If you see either white or yellow discolouration on your toes, especially on your toenails, that is a sign of a fungal infection,\" says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull.\nAlthough in many countries, such as the US and the UK, you can buy over-the-counter topical medication for mild fungal nail infections, if you leave it too late then it can become more difficult to treat. (It's important to always consult a doctor if you suspect that you have a nail infection.)\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of the time when people have discolouration in the nails they don't realise that it's an infection, so it can get to a point where it becomes quite bad, and then they have to go and see a podiatrist,\" says Wilkinson.\nMeanwhile the shape of the nail can also reveal underlying problems. Healthy toe and fingernails should be convex, which means they curve slightly outwards. They shouldn't contain any dips or craters. If they do, it may be a sign that you have koilonychia, a condition where the nail curves inwards and looks thin and brittle. In some cases, people with koilonychia have a central depression in their nail deep enough to hold a drop of fluid, hence the condition is often referred to as \"spoon nails\".\u00a0\nIf your any of your nails bear a resemblance to a spoon, this could be a sign of anaemia, when the body doesn't have enough healthy blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency. However, it can also be a sign of coeliac disease, among other conditions.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, some changes in the nail can indicate nutritional deficiencies. Some people have horizontal ridges, known as Beau's lines, that run horizontally across their nails. This could indicate a deficiency such as insufficient protein. However, this feature could also be a sign of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease \u2013 a disorder involving reduced circulation of blood to certain parts of the body, usually due to the buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries \u2013 so it is still important to get it checked out.\n\"Beau's lines can indicate zinc deficiency, while brittle nails are a sign of hypothyroidism or vitamin B7 deficiency,\" says Mary Pearson, a paediatrician working at the University Hospital of Wales. \"In some cases we might be more diligent about looking for these, for example in safeguarding cases where we are concerned about a child's nutrition, or where we suspect chronic disease,\" she says.\nIn other cases, nail changes may be caused by lifestyle factors rather than health problems. For example peeling nails, also known as\u00a0onychoschizia, occurs when thin layers of the nails literally separate from the free nail edge and peel back. \"Onychoschizia may be the result of excessive hand washing, nail dryness, and the use of acrylics and other nail polishes,\" says Joshua Zeichner, professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital\u00a0in New York.\u00a0\nYou may wonder what it is about nails that makes them so revealing of a person's underlying health. One of the main reasons is that nails are obviously one of the few parts of the body that you can see from the outside.\n\"Nails are extensions of the skin, effectively, and your skin can tell you so much about what's going on in your body,\" says Baumgardt. \"Your first impression of a patient often starts from the bedside, so you look them all over and you start off with their nails, you look in their eyes and their mouth. And you start to do an end-of-the-bed assessment, trying to pick out diagnostic pictures from that point early on. So nails are one of the first things we see,\" he says.\nWhile most of the time changes in the nail are harmless, and are simply down to a nail injury, if you notice that the change in shape, colour, or texture is more permanent, then you should always consult the advice of a doctor.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Jeremy Sewall has cooked at eateries around the world, but home in Boston, he's known for his clam chowder. Here are his top local bowls, from Neptune Oyster to Yankee Lobster.\nNew England Clam chowder \u2013 a stick-to-your-ribs cream-based clam and potato stew \u2013 is beloved all over the United States, but synonymous with the city of Boston.\nClear broth-style chowders or stews made by the New England region's Indigenous peoples date back hundreds of years, including tribes in what is now Massachusetts. Quahogs, a type of local clam, along with other shellfish, fish and native ingredients like corn and beans were primary ingredients in early-recorded renditions of the chowder, which later incorporated traditions brought by English settlers, who swapped corn and beans for potatoes. And since 1836, chowder \u2013 or chowdah, as it's often pronounced in Boston \u2013 has been proudly served at the city's Union Oyster House, the oldest restaurant in continuous service in the US. Over the decades, New England-style clam chowder has become woven into the very fabric of the city's culinary identity.\nThough Boston's food scene has become world-class and international, clam chowder is still found on menus all over town, from the city's finest eateries to the concession stands at Fenway Park, the iconic Red Sox ballpark. But not all creamy clam chowders are made equal. To highlight Boston's most extraordinary bowls, we spoke to Jeremy Sewall, chef and partner of Row 34 in Boston's atmospheric Seaport.\nThe SpeciaList\nNationally recognised chef Jeremy Sewall helmed kitchens around the world before opening New England seafood restaurant Row 34 in Boston. Today, the restaurant has four locations throughout the region, with a second Boston location planned later in 2025. Sewall has co-written a trio of lauded seafood cookbooks and has appeared on numerous cooking television shows, including Top Chef and Beat Bobby Flay.\nWhile the hallmarks of traditional New England clam chowder are sacrosanct \u2013 a milky-white creamy base, chopped clams, diced potatoes and often bacon or salt pork \u2013 opinions vary on other elements and ingredients. Sewall himself thickens Row 34's chowder with a traditional roux of flour and butter, adding salty bacon fat to deliver a velvety taste. His secret ingredient is a subtle dash of green tabasco. \"It adds a nice little bit of spice and acidity to it,\" he says. \"[Chowder's] been a part of Boston culture for a long time and represents what New England is. It's a hearty, simple dish that, when done really well, is an iconic thing. That's why it's been around for hundreds of years and is still one of the most popular dishes in Boston.\"\nSewall adds that Boston's location on Massachusetts Bay, and by extension, the Atlantic Ocean, intrinsically lends itself to phenomenal just-caught seafood. \"It's accessible here,\" he says. \"It's just part of how we make things; certainly a simple thing like chowder. The chopped clams that everybody traditionally uses for chowder, they're all available, so it's just how we cook here.\"\nHere are Sewall's favourite clam chowders in Boston.\nSummer Shack is a laidback restaurant in Boston's affluent Back Bay neighbourhood, just three blocks from the world-famous Boston Marathon finish line. This renowned spot is a casual outpost founded by the late Jasper White, an iconic chef best known as a pioneer in Boston fine dining. Summer Shack's menu promises a \"classic New England clam chowder\", and delivers a medium-thick, clam-packed creation. \"I think they're really good about not letting it get too thick. Some places do a really thick chowder, which I don't love,\" says Sewall. \"Summer Shack's is classic. It's oyster crackers and bacon and chopped clams and potatoes; that's exactly what I wanted today.\"\nMost Boston restaurants serve their chowder alongside packs of Westminster Backer's Co oyster crackers \u2013 flaky, dime-size crackers that diners can add in at their discretion. But Summer Shack takes the liberty of serving their chowder with oyster crackers already on top. \"Any chowder has to have some good pieces of stuff in there because it adds that texture,\" says Sewall. \"It can't be all pur\u00e9ed. You've got to feel like you're seeing stuff on your spoon and chewing things. Anything that's too creamy or too pur\u00e9ed? No. Doesn't work.\"\nWebsite: www.summershackrestaurant.com/location/summer-shack-boston\nAddress: 50 Dalton Street, Boston, MA 02115\nPhone: +1 617-867-9955\nInstagram: @jwsummershack\n\"Little Whale's is another great version of a classic clam chowder; very straight forward,\" says Sewall, crediting the restaurant's chef Michael Serpa. \"He does fresh clam, potato, bacon, celery and a little bit of fresh herbs in there. That's what chowder is supposed to be.\"\nInsider Tip\nBoston is the quintessential four-season city \u2013 cold winters, hot summers, a mild spring and a crisp autumn that Sewall believes stands out as the best time to visit. The cool air relieves the summer heat, he says, and Boston's many tree-lined streets transform into a cacophony of colour thanks to unbelievable autumn foliage. \"A New England fall is hard to beat,\" says Sewall. \"Things quiet down a bit compared to that frantic summer feel.\"\nThough chef Serpa is otherwise known for creative takes on seafood classics, cherrystone clams are the cornerstone of Little Whale's chowder. These meaty but lean palm-sized hard-shelled clams are well-suited for chowder as they are sweet and mild, their briny tenderness emphasised by the creamy broth. Though native to the US's East Coast, many chefs in the US gravitate to cherrystones harvested from New England's cool waters. Serpa's menu specifies that their rendition of chowder includes smoked bacon and thyme, flavours that impart a subtle smoky punch and dash of earthiness.\nNestled in a 19th-Century brownstone, Little Whale is a petite, charming eatery on tony Newbury Street in Back Bay. A banquette lines the wall, but the marble-top bar is one of the best spots to belly up for a chowder bowl, unless it's warm out, when the patio reigns supreme.\nWebsite: www.littlewhaleboston.com\nAddress: 314 Newbury Street, Boston, MA 02115\nPhone: +1 857-277-0800\nInstagram: @littlewhaleoysterbar\nWith cosy marble tables for two and a robust wine list full of celebratory bubbly, this tiny 37-seat temple to briny aphrodisiacs oozes romance.\nNeptune Oyster, modelled after classic Parisian oyster bars, has been a staple in Boston's predominately Italian North End neighbourhood \u2013 an iconic culinary hub \u2013 for more than two decades. A queue promising an hour-long wait is common outside this shoebox-sized restaurant, which swells with accolades from sources like The New York Times and the James Beard Foundation.\n\"Neptune does an awesome job,\" says Sewall. \"It's a classic oyster bar and they've done chowder in Boston for many, many years. It's consistent, and that can be hard to do.\"\nNeptune's Wellfleet clam chowder, named after the coastal community on nearby Cape Cod where the clams are sourced, is the most brothy on Sewall's list compared to thicker renditions, but it offers hearty chunks of fresh clams and tender potatoes that stop just short of mushy and a savouriness derived from salt-cured pork belly. Topped with thyme and a sprinkle of paprika, Neptune Oyster's chowder is perfectly suitable on its own or as an idyllic prelude to the restaurant's iconic lobster roll.\nWebsite: www.neptuneoyster.com\nAddress: 63 Salem Street #1, Boston, MA 02113\nPhone: +1 617-742-3474\nInstagram: @neptuneoyster\n\"James Hook does a really good chowder,\" says Sewall. A family-owned lobster restaurant and Boston mainstay since 1925, James Hook earned its enviable reputation in the lobster business, catching the crustaceans in Maine and Canada then hauling the lot down to Boston for distribution. Today, the restaurant ships more than 50,000lb of lobster daily across the US, while their simple counter-service seafood shanty is just steps from Boston Harbor.\nJames Hook's menu boasts New England clam \"chowda\" with a consistency that is thick, but not enough to distract from the flavour of the sweet whole clams, punctuated by hearty thick-cut potatoes. It's twice been crowned champion of Boston's annual Chowderfest, a summertime competition of the best chowders in the region.\nWebsite: https://www.jameshooklobster.com\nAddress: 440 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02110\nPhone: +1 617-423-5501\nInstagram: @jameshooklobster\nA Boston favourite since 1950, Yankee Lobster is run by the third generation of the Zanti family, who have made their living on the water. The restaurant is decidedly casual \u2013 diners order at a counter and are given a buoy with a number letting servers know where to deliver their grub. Yankee Lobster doubles as a seafood market, and its location in Boston's swanky Seaport lures locals and visitors alike.\nThe legendary \"spoon test\" for New England clam chowder is performed by inserting a spoon in the centre of the chowder to see if the consistency is thick enough to make the spoon stand straight up. Though Sewall says he personally prefers chowder not quite thick enough to pass the spoon test, he is a fan of Yankee Lobster's chowder. \"It's traditional, it's creamy, it's hot and it's rich \u2013 all the stuff it should be,\" he says. \"They do a great job.\"\nWebsite: https://www.yankeelobster.com\nAddress: 300 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA 02210\nPhone: +1 617-423-5501\nInstagram: @yankeelobsterco\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "As travellers flock to the English countryside to celebrate the renowned novelist, we asked experts to weigh in on the best Austen-themed festivals, reenactments and balls of the year.\nWith bonnets and boarding passes ready, a brigade of Jane Austen fans from around the world is preparing to bombard Britain, eager to celebrate one of English literature's greatest writers throughout 2025 on her 250th birthday.\nFrom the dashing John Willoughby in Sense and Sensibility to the spirited Emma Woodhouse in the eponymous Emma, Austen's characters have enchanted generations of readers, inspiring yearly pilgrimages to her home county of Hampshire and beyond to trace her footsteps. This year, these journeys take on a celebratory air as travellers flock to the English countryside for literary festivals, reenactments and Regency balls designed to pay tribute to the author.\nHere are the year's most ostentatious events, according to Austen experts \u2013 the ones promising fans an unforgettable birthday bash for a writer who presciently wrote, \"One cannot have too large a party.\"\nAlthough her vivid portrayals of English life now epitomise the extravagance of the Georgian era, Austen's own story began modestly. She was born on 16 December 1775, in the village of Steventon, in Hampshire, England, the seventh child and youngest daughter of clergyman George Austen and his wife Cassandra.\n\"It must have been a bustling household, with the large Austen family and the boys her father tutored,\" said Janet Todd, one of Britain's leading Austen scholars. Although the rectory where the Austens lived was demolished in 1824, St Nicholas Church, where they worshipped, still stands. A dedicated team of volunteers is working to ensure every visit to the historic chapel is memorable.\nNot at all bowing to the idea of being the country cousin to the author's more well-known former towns, like Bath and Chawton, Steventon has organised lively events for June, July and December. Visitors can attend the Jane Austen's Words and Music Chamber concert on 8 June\u00a0 at her family's chapel or join a country fair on 6 June held in the same pump field where the Austen's parsonage home once stood. Then, in remembrance, the church will hold a special Thanksgiving Service for Austen on her birthday on 16 December.\nIn Austen's England, balls were pivotal to social life and courtship among the middle and upper classes. For Zack Pinsent, a 29-year-old tailor known for exclusively wearing Regency-era attire, attending a ball is the ultimate tribute to Austen. This year's calendar is packed with options, from a Regency Week Ball in Alton this June to a Yuletide Birthday Ball in Bath come December. However, Pinsent recommends the Brighton Royal Grand Pavilion Ball on January 25, which he is organising and has already drawn attendees from 16 countries.\n\"Anyone can attend, as long as they have the right outfit,\" said Pinsent, who has secured the Royal Pavilion for the eponymous Regency-inspired event.\nBrighton's Royal Pavilion, built by George IV, Austen's contemporary and admirer, hosted extravagant balls in its heyday. Though there's no evidence Austen ever visited, Pinsent speculates she may have, given Brighton's influence on her imagination. The seaside town even earned a mention in Pride and Prejudice, when Austen wrote of Lydia Bennet: \"At Brighton, she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\"\nAusten set two of her novels, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, in Bath, but her feelings about the resort town remain debated. Her famously dramatic reaction to her family's move there from Steventon \u2013 she allegedly fainted \u2013 hints at reluctance. Still, during her years in Bath (1801-1806), its vibrant social scene, from galas at Sydney Gardens to events at the Assembly Rooms, inspired her work. However, personal tragedy, including her father's death during this time, likely influenced her perception of the city.\n\"The party line is, we don't really know how she felt about Bath,\" said Georgia Delve, director of the Jane Austen Centre Festival (held 12-21 September in Bath). \"But I think in terms of her storyline and the characters, you walk around the city, and it's all written in the stone: you get Bennett Street, you've got Bartlett Street, you've got the Assembly Rooms, you've got the Royal Crescent, you've got the Paragon, you know, great Pulteney Street. All these places come up in her letters and novels.\"\nBath's enduring love for Austen is clear, exemplified by its Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of people in Regency costumes. This year's Austen Festival begins with a grand promenade, drawing fans worldwide.\nBeyond the festival, the Jane Austen Centre is hosting two summer Regency balls, including a Persuasion-themed Nautical Ball on 31 May and a unique Sanditon-inspired event based on Austen's unfinished novel of the same name on 28 June. The event will include dance workshops to master waltzes and cotillions.\nThe port city of Southampton played a role in Austen's life on three occasions \u2013 an often-overlooked fact that the town is hoping to rectify this year. She briefly attended boarding school there, celebrated her 18th birthday at the city's historic Dolphin Hotel, and later stayed there with her brother after departing Bath. To honour the city's deep ties, Southampton plans to display her travel writing desk now through \u200b\u200b23 February at God's House Tower, on loan from the British Library as part of the exhibit In Training for a Heroine. The portable mahogany desk was a gift from her father, and on it, she wrote what she referred to as \"My own darling child,\" the first draft of Pride and Prejudice. Tickets are free, but visitors must reserve a time to see the installation.\nAccording to Todd, much of Austen's enduring appeal lies in her connection to a romanticised England. Hampshire, where she lived, wrote, and set many of her novels, preserved its charm by avoiding industrialisation. This timeless quality makes a visit to the author's former home in Chawton, now called Jane Austen's House, a uniquely transportive experience. After her father's death left Jane, her sister and their mother nearly penniless, with only \u00a3210 a year, according to Todd, Jane's brother Edward eventually moved them into his cottage in 1809. It was here, in this idyllic setting, that Jane refined her six novels.\nMore like this:\n \u2022 What Jane Austen can teach us about resilience\n \u2022 Britain's greatest natural wonders to explore in the wintertime\n \u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\nTo celebrate the writer's 250th birthday, the Jane Austen House hosts a Pride and Prejudice Festival from 23-28 January, featuring Austenmania, a year-long exhibit dedicated to her posthumous cinematic legacy. The site has also launched a permanent exhibition, Jane Austen and the Art of Writing, showcasing her creative process and first editions of her works. \"It's quite moving to be in there with them,\" said 15-year docent Janie McShane of the priceless tomes. For many visitors, that's the real allure, to see how Austen lived, \"to tread,\" McShane said, \"where she tread\".\nAusten was an enthusiastic walker. In a world where a woman's life was nearly always spent supervised or in the company of family and friends, taking a stroll likely meant freedom and escape. \"Austen's characters walk to be themselves and to change,\" writes Rachel Cohen in Austen Years: A Memoir in Five Novels. \nPat Lerew, chair of the Jane Austen Alton Group, says her village will give visitors the same opportunity. Alton is reasonably short stroll from Austen's House. \"We know Jane and her sister walked into Alton two or three times a week to shop or visit with friends,\" Lerew said. \"She would also pick up the coach here to go to London.\" Similarly, the 10-day Jane Austen Regency Week (20-29 June) will include a Regency Day with stalls and entertainment guests can peruse, followed by a ribbon cutting on a new public Jane Austen Garden.\nThe final chapter of Jane's life was tragic. At 41, she fell ill with a mysterious condition that modern experts have speculated may have been Addison's disease or Hodgkin lymphoma. Her deteriorating condition required a move from Chawton cottage to Winchester to seek specialised care. Jane and her sister Cassandra took up residence at No. 8 College Street, a property now owned by Winchester College, a historic boarding school attended by eight of Austen's nephews. This summer, for the first time ever, the school is opening the apartments to the public.\n\"The apartment remains strikingly similar to how it was in Austen's time,\" said Richard Foster, the Fellows' Librarian and Keeper of Collections at the college, who has played a key role in organising the opening. \"Austen describes a neat little drawing room with a bay window overlooking the headmaster's garden, and those features are still intact.\" It was in this space that Austen penned her final poem, and from the same bay window, Cassandra watched her sister's funeral procession \u2013 restricted by 19th-Century customs that barred women from attending.\nTickets for this limited-time opening are available online. Visitors can also honour Austen at her final resting place in the north nave of Winchester Cathedral.

Racism remained the most reported form of discrimination, with a 47% rise in abuse across all levels.\n\"These are footballers, but they're [also] real human beings, and when you see the abuse that they face, it's just totally unacceptable,\" said Okafor.\n\"We did a research with 1,500 women fans, and one in four still feel unsafe going to games. 52% said they experienced sexism within a stadium. So there's still a huge amount of cultural work to do to make the game more inclusive.\n\"People are feeling more freedom to share their toxic and discriminatory abuse online, in particular.\"\nBut rules in the 2023 Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show they are removing illegal content, with the platforms given until March to implement measures or face fines.\n\"We believe that's going to give the regulator more powers to be able to hold the social media firms to account, as well as providing better user-empowerment tools,\" said Okafor.\n\"This is really important, because you can see the impact it has. So this is a real opportunity to tackle that. It can be a real game changer.\"\nTech giant Meta recently announced it is abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram, to the dismay of campaigners against hate speech online.\n\"That really does trouble me,\" said Okafor. \"That really does make the job harder.\n\"And that's why we need the regulators to use their powers to really hold social media firms to account, and to issue those penalties.\"\nIn 2020, the FA launched a voluntary Diversity Code in a bid to tackle racial inequality in the English game.\nHowever, only 53 clubs signed up to provide data on their workforce annually, and collectively they failed to meet any of the eight recruitment targets.\nHaving admitted that progress had been \"slower than hoped\", the FA has made it mandatory for all professional clubs in the English game to provide full diversity workforce data on age, sex, gender, ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation within their organisation by June.\n\"We've been calling for this for a number of years,\" said Okafor.\n\"It may feel uncomfortable, but other industries do this on a regular basis, so it's football just trying to catch up to where it should be in terms of bringing the data into the light.\n\"The more crucial step is what happens when the data comes out.\n\"I'm really interested in seeing - do clubs reflect their communities? If they don't, there's an opportunity to ensure that they've got the relevant plans.\n\"What you can see there is clearly a lack of black coaches, of South Asian representation within football. There is a lack of diversity when it comes to match officials, in terms of boardrooms.\"\nOkafor says clubs should face fines if they fail to publish the data.\n\"We're very hopeful that all the clubs will have published their data,\" he added.\n\"And if not, then we'll be expecting that there should be a level of consequence as a result.\n\"This is certainly not about league tables or naming and shaming clubs.

        "article_text": "Greenlandic politician and Inuit educator Aleqa Hammond shares her top ways to experience the country, from sampling Greenlandic cuisine to viewing the Northern Lights in Ilulissat.\nAt a staggering 2.16 million sq km, Greenland is the world's largest island \u2013 and its least densely populated. A colossal ice sheet covers roughly 80% of its mass; most of the population (56,000) lives in urban areas along its south-west coast.\u00a0\nThe Specialist\nAleqa Hammond is a politician and former member of the Greenland Parliament. Her political career began in 2005 when she held various ministerial roles, including Minister of Finances and Foreign Affairs. In 2013, she became Greenland's first female Prime Minister.\nBut Greenland still attracts visitors with its stunning natural backdrop of glaciers and icebergs. Adventurers enjoy kayaking, hiking and dog sledding in the vast wilderness. The midnight sun, Northern Lights and colourful villages only add to this Arctic destination's allure.\nWe asked Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister (2013-2014), how to explore this land of contrasts. \"Greenland is so vast and huge and undiscovered in many ways that after the Ilulissat Icefjord received a World Heritage site designation in 2004, it was not recognised by Unesco again for another 13 years,\" she says. \"It has three now, which shows that the country has so much to offer.\"\nIn November 2024, Nuuk International Airport opened in the country's capital. And in 2026, two more international airports will open \u2013 in Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest city, and Qaqortoq, in southern Greenland. As Greenlanders prepare for an influx of visitors, Hammond is optimistic. \"Everybody wants this change because we want to have a stronger economy, and we want to be more self-sufficient.\"\nAccording to the Greenlandic Ministry of Business, Trade, Mineral Resources, Justice and Gender Equality, over the past five years, tourism in Greenland has grown by 46%; primarily due to a surge in demand from travellers eager to explore new destinations after Covid-19 \u2013 particularly those with wide-open spaces. The numbers are expected to rise with the new airports.\nBut \"Greenland does not want mass tourism,\" says Hammond. \"Greenland wants better tourism. We want tourism that's to the benefit of the people of this country, not to overwhelm us. It's going to be a very controlled place, and that makes it special.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hammond's favourite ways to experience Greenland.\nNuuk, Greenland's capital, is home to approximately 20,000 residents. But \"it's very much a metropolitan city\", says Hammond. \"There's museums, there's cafes, there's so many shopping opportunities and concerts, it's so alive.\"\nLocated in Nuuk's Colonial Harbour, the Greenland National Museum & Archives is a fascinating place to delve into the country's history and culture. \"The museum is absolutely worth visiting,\" Hammond says. \"It's well organised and it's doing a lot of archaeological excavations in remote places in Greenland.\"\nThe best of 2025\nGreenland was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list\u00a0here.\nThe museum's exhibitions cover a vast span of Greenland's history, from the first Paleo-Eskimo cultures that arrived thousands of years ago to a period of Norse settlement in the 10th Century and Thule migration in the 13th Century, followed by Danish colonisation in the 18th Century.\nThe museum is also known for its collection of well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies \u2013 the naturally mummified remains of a family from Northern Greenland's Paleo-Eskimo Saqqaq culture, who lived sometime between 2500 BCE to 800 BCE. \"They are the oldest mummies in the world of Inuit heritage,\" says Hammond, who is Inuit as well as a respected Inuit educator and former commissioner of the\u00a0Inuit Circumpolar Council.\u00a0\"These mummies were found in 1972 in the Uummannaq area of North Greenland, where I'm from.\"\nExhibiting the mummies hasn't been without controversy. \"It was a big discussion back then whether they should belong to a museum or not, and a lot of Greenlanders were not very happy that they ended up there,\" Hammond says. \"Today, everybody's satisfied because [of] world interest on how the Inuit have been living and are living, and what cultural heritage we have. This is the oldest proof.\"\nWebsite:\u00a0https://en.nka.gl/\nAddress: Hans Egedesvej 8, Box 145, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 32 26 11\nInstagram:\u00a0@natmus_gl\nWhen it comes to fine dining in Nuuk, one of Hammond's favourites is Restaurant Sarfalik, which is located on the top floor of the upscale Hotel Hans Egede in the city centre. Sarfalik specialises in showcasing the best of Greenlandic cuisine, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced from local hunters and fishermen. A blend of Inuit tradition and survival, cooking techniques include drying, fermenting and smoking.\n\"Using local ingredients is a trend in Greenland,\" Hammond says. \"We have such great resources, and each town has its own open fish and meat market with a choice of musk ox, reindeer, halibut and cod. Everything is there.\"\nSarfalik has an open layout with a cosy brasserie feel, and the menu features traditional Greenlandic fare with a modern twist as well as internationally inspired creations. There's also a tasting menu that allows for sampling various entrees. \"It's not enormous plates, but very beautiful and wonderfully made,\" Hammond says. \"It's a gastronomic experience.\"\nWebsite: https://hhe.gl/restaurant-sarfalik/?lang=en\nAddress: Hotel Hans Egede, Aqqusinersuaq 1 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 34 80 00\nInstagram: @sarfalik\nA significant cultural hub, Nuuk Art Museum features a mix of Greenlandic and international art. \"Because we have many artists in Nuuk, it's very well-visited, and it's a big museum that's absolutely worth a trip,\" says Hammond.\nA gift from Danish-Greenlandic philanthropists Svend and Helene Junge Pedersen to the people of Nuuk, the museum is situated in city centre in a former Adventist church, striking for its high ceilings, wooden beams and stained-glass windows. In addition to exhibitions, the museum also hosts events, workshops and educational programmes, such as an art walk around the city that can be downloaded as a podcast.\nIts primary focus is to showcase the work of Greenlandic artists and the depiction of Greenland in art. This includes a significant number of works by early 20th-Century landscape artist Emanuel A Petersen, known for his romanticised portrayals of Greenlandic nature. The museum's exhibits showcase a variety of media, including paintings, watercolours, drawings and sculptures made from materials like soapstone, ivory and wood.\n\"Greenlandic art is an expression of Inuit culture, which is deeply connected to the land, wildlife and Arctic traditions,\" Hammond says. \"Our spirits, legends, and traditional beliefs are also often depicted, as well as animals important for survival like seals, whales and polar bears.\"\nWebsite: https://www.nuukkunstmuseum.com/\nAddress: Kissarneqqortuunnguaq 5, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 36 60 33\nInstagram: @nuukartmuseum\nDepending on the time of year, the Northern Lights are literally all around. \"It's like trees,\" Hammond says. \"You don't really notice them unless one specific tree is really beautiful. We don't have trees here, but there's a lot of Northern Lights.\"\nTip\nTo view Greenland's Northern Lights, \"from September until February is a perfect time\", says Hammond. \"Greenland has long, dark nights during this period, and clearer skies compared to other seasons. When we know that there's going to be a very good Northern Lights night, we put on a lot of clothes, bring our tea and take a hike around the village. Then we just sit there and enjoy it. And nobody says a word for a very long time, because this beauty is so much more than 1,000 words.\"\nDespite their frequent occurrence, the Northern Lights are also a reminder of Hammond's heritage, so she never takes them for granted.\n\"The Northern Lights have both entertainment and cultural value,\" she says. \"We know who they are \u2013 that's our ancestors, and that's why we love watching them. We honour our ancestors a lot, and we can always see them in our environment. In Greenland, you can see them in the sky.\"\nWitnessing the Northern Lights is especially meaningful at the Ilulissat Icefjord, a deep sea inlet filled with massive icebergs. A Unesco World Heritage site, it is one of the fastest moving and most active glaciers in the world, moving around 40m per day.\n\"It's very easy to walk out to the Icefjord at night because there's a boardwalk and you can take it out to a bench with the best view in the world,\" Hammond says. \"Sit on that bench and you'll be right in front of the icebergs. The Northern Lights give a special light to the icefjord, and the icebergs get another glow, another colour. It's the ultimate Northern Lights experience.\"\nLocated on the west coast, Ilulissat is about 250km north of the Arctic Circle. Historically a fishing village, it is also known for its sled dogs. The Icefjord is a short bus ride from town and the boardwalk is easily accessible as it extends from the car park.\nThe Ilulissat Icefjord Centre is situated on the edge of the icefjord and provides interactive displays, artefacts and scientific data.\nWebsite:\u00a0https://isfjordscentret.gl/en/ilulissat-icefjord-centre/\nAddress: Sermermiut Aqqutaa B 2089, 3952 Ilulissat\nPhone: +299 55 55 88\nInstagram:\u00a0@ilulissat_isfjordscentret\nGreenland is as famous for its epic wildlife as it is for its stunning Northern Lights. Depending on the region, you might see reindeer, musk oxen, polar bears, Arctic foxes and a variety of whales \u2013 including elusive narwhals with their unicorn-like tusks.\nHammond suggests admiring the island's wildlife via both land and sea by combining a city break with an expedition cruise like Adventure Canada, which offers six Greenland itineraries with plans to expand to East Greenland in 2025.\nThe best chance to spot polar bears is in East Greenland because, according to Hammond, \"the big impact of the North Pole ice melting is that they are all going that way\". Arctic wildlife \u2013 both marine and mammal \u2013 can be spotted via a small ship cruise or by hiking the Arctic Circle Trail. Because polar bears are powerful predators, observing them from a ship provides a safe vantage point and minimises risks. Arctic cruises are the best ways to spot marine wildlife, especially whales, seals and walruses.\n\"Fly into Greenland first, and then take your own trip, maybe from Nuuk to Ilulissat or vice versa, and go on from there,\" she says. \"You can come in a few days ahead of time and experience the authentic Greenland for yourself by partaking in activities like hiking before you embark on the cruise. Greenland has incredible hiking trails, and the further you venture into the wilderness, the more likely you are to encounter animals.\"\nWebsite: https://www.adventurecanada.com/\nPhone: +1 800 363 7566\nInstagram: @adventure.canada\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Elina M\u00e4kinen was the first Finnish woman to complete the Ice Mile. Here are her top ice bathing experiences, from plunges under the Northern Lights to paying homage to Arctic gods.\nFrom the technicolour sky dance of the Northern Lights to freely roaming reindeer, Finnish Lapland is a true winter wonderland. Its frozen Arctic landscapes, pristine natural waters and rich sauna tradition also provide the ideal backdrop for ice bathing \u2013 the traditional holistic practice of submerging the body either fully or partially in ice-cold water.\nWe spoke with Finnish ice swimmer Elina M\u00e4kinen to learn more about this hallowed self-care ritual. Though M\u00e4kinen is renowned for breaking records in distance ice swimming, she stresses that ice swimming \u2013 and ice bathing \u2013 are a personal, not competitive experience. \"I only have the need to compete with myself,\" she says. \"The ice hole is a place to learn about yourself and your reactions.\"\nElina M\u00e4kinen, based in Muonio, Lapland, in winters, is the first Finn to complete the Ice Mile \u2013 a mile swim in 5C or colder water. One of only six women globally to do so, she shares her ice bathing experiences on TikTok and features in the documentary Cold.\nFinland's sauna culture, part of Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, dates back thousands of years, and ice bathing has always gone hand in hand with wintry sauna sessions. In recent years, the practice has become more mainstream and its health benefits have become better known.\n\"Its popularity surged during and after the Covid-19 pandemic,\" says M\u00e4kinen. \"While many once practiced it to relieve from ailments like rheumatism, today, no specific reason is needed to take the plunge. Ice bathing now stands alongside yoga, meditation and other practices focused on self-discovery. People use it for various benefits \u2013 some to improve sleep, others to wake up in the morning.\"\nIn cities like Helsinki or Tampere \u2013 the sauna capital of the world \u2013 many saunas offer ice bathing, with both traditional public saunas and modern lakeside spas providing safe environments for taking your first dip in frozen waters. In more remote locations, such as Lapland, many hotels and cottages offer the unique experience of pairing a steamy sauna session with a frosty plunge into an ice hole.\nHere are M\u00e4kinen's top five Arctic winter wonderland spots for ice bathing.\nDue to very little light pollution, Finnish Lapland \u2013 a sparsely populated region with about 176,000 inhabitants in an area roughly the size of Scotland and Wales combined \u2013 is one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights. And according to M\u00e4kinen, home to wonderful lakes for ice bathing.\nTip\nM\u00e4kinen urges people to make ice \u00a0bathing a safe and enjoyable experience. \"The safest way to practice ice bathing is never to do it alone,\" she says. \"Take on challenges but do it carefully.\" For beginners, the best way is to start slowly, by brushing cold water on the skin or alternating sauna sessions with brief dips. M\u00e4kinen advises people to listen to their bodies and go at their own pace. Ice bathing is personal, and finding a comfort zone is key to safely enjoying the experience.\n\"I start my ice bathing season in S\u00e4rkitunturi, because the small lakes up on the tiny mountain freeze faster,\" says M\u00e4kinen. \"I have often swum here under the Northern Lights.\"\nS\u00e4rkitunturi is a 492m-tall mount with sweeping views of the gently rounded slopes of the Pallastunturi fell; recognised in 1994 as one of Finland's top national landscapes. Arriving is relatively easy \u2013 by Lapland standards. A drive from Muonio takes 20 minutes with parking available along Route 79 to begin the hike up.\nM\u00e4kinen often makes her own ice holes in the Arctic wilderness using an ice saw, a drill, tongs, ice pick or rope in case the ice block has to be lifted on top of the ice \u2013 and a motor saw on very special occasions. But she also has a tip for a more easy-going dip: \"If you prefer a sauna and a ready-made ice hole, just call to S\u00e4rkij\u00e4rven majat [lodges].\" These rustic lakeside cabins offer accommodation and a wood-fired sauna by the lakeside \u2013 borrow the provided woollen socks to stay warmer while dipping in the water.\nWebsite: https://sarkijarvenmajat.fi/ \n Address: S\u00e4rkij\u00e4rventie 40, 99300 Muonio\n Phone: +358 400 905 863\n Instagram: @sarkijarvenmajat\nKuusamo, a city of about 15,000 inhabitants with an airport near Finland's eastern border, lies just below the Arctic Circle and is home to some of the country's most dramatic scenery scenery, featuring canyons, waterfalls and vast forests that create a sense of limitless wilderness. \"It's very [impressive], and you get away from the hustle and bustle of city life,\" says M\u00e4kinen.\nJust a 50-minute drive north-east from here, to an area even more remote, you'll find Isokenk\u00e4isten Klubi. \"It is a wilderness lodge,\" says M\u00e4kinen. \"A fabulous log cottage in the middle of nowhere.\"\nOriginally built as a winter retreat for Finnish presidents and prime ministers, the lodge combines tradition with modern comfort, offering both a traditional smoke sauna heated up with birch logs and a modern electric sauna. Naturally, there is an ice hole for a refreshing Finnish experience. The club is also part of the Sustainable Travel Finland (STF) programme, a framework of sustainable tourism establishments in Finland.\nIsokenk\u00e4isten Klubi was featured in the documentary Cold,\u00a0as this is where M\u00e4kinen built a 10m-long practice pool for her Ice Mile swim.\nWebsite: https://www.ikk.fi/en/\nAddress: Heikinj\u00e4rventie 3, 93800 Kuusamo\nPhone: +358 400 972 260 /+358 40 706 6839\nInstagram: @isokenkaistenklubi\n\n\"The Arctic Sauna World is the paradise of the north,\" says M\u00e4kinen, describing the cluster of four saunas by the scenic shores of Lake Jerisj\u00e4rvi, close to the\u00a0Pulju Wilderness Area in northern Lapland. Jerisj\u00e4rvi is a sacred lake for the indigenous S\u00e1mi people of Finland, with a sacrificial and burial ground close by, and is known for its abundance of fish.\nJeris Arctic Sauna World hosts various types of saunas, from smoke sauna to a sauna with an upper floor for viewing the Northern Lights, all named after Finland's traditional gods: Tapio (the revered god of forests), Ukko (god of weather, harvest and thunder), Ilmatar (goddesses of the air) and Vellamo (goddess of water). From the saunas, it\u2019s an easy \u2013 yet chilling \u2013 dip into the ready-made avanto (ice hole), just a few steps away.\n\"You can see the Olos fells [in] the background, and many stunning sunsets and golden hours in January happen especially here. This might be the world's most beautiful ice hole,\" says M\u00e4kinen.\nThere are hotels in the area, and even if your accommodation is further away, a bus will connect you to the site. \"In the Yll\u00e4s-Pallas-Levi-Olos region, everyone can get here,\" says M\u00e4kinen. \"Even if it takes an hour to drive, in these regions, that's a short trip.\"\nWebsite: https://harriniva.fi/en/arctic-sauna-world/\nAddress: Jerisj\u00e4rventie 91, 99300 Muonio\nPhone: +358 400 155 100\nInstagram: @arcticsaunaworld\nFor a winter hike, M\u00e4kinen calls Lake Hietaj\u00e4rvi in the northern parts of Pallas-Yll\u00e4stunturi National Park a \"hidden gem\" and \"worth the adventure\" with its crystal-clear water and outdoor fireplace \u2013 a \"laavu\" \u2013 to warm up after a swim, with firewood on-site provided by the Finnish government. \"For us Finns, lakes with clear water are magnificent as our lakes are often very humic,\" says M\u00e4kinen. \"The light-coloured sandy beach makes an impression. It's a real reward just to find this place.\"\nThe lake is far from any habitation and somewhat difficult to reach, although there are route signs for hiking from the Ketomella bridge parking spot. However, you are likely to spot many of the furry, hooved locals during your hike here. \"You have to pass reindeer roundup sites and you might encounter a lot of reindeer,\" says M\u00e4kinen. Fun fact: there are more reindeer (around 200,000) living in Finnish Lapland than there are people.\nM\u00e4kinen notes that this experience is for advanced ice swimmers as you need your own equipment, such as an ahkio (a long sledge for snowy conditions) and an ice saw, to create the ice hole. \"Whenever you go for a hike to find ice bathing spots, you need to make sure of safety and warm up after [the plunge],\" she says. \"But for sure, you'll be the only person in winter to make up an ice hole here.\"\nIn the northernmost reaches of Arctic Lapland, Lake Kilpisj\u00e4rvi and Mount Saana, the 1,029m mountain rising on its shore, form a revered landscape, lauded in songs and paintings.\n\"I lived in Kilpisj\u00e4rvi (village) one winter for three months,\" says M\u00e4kinen. \"Normally, there are about 100 inhabitants. It's a very communal place and immensely beautiful \u2013 you'll also get a little piece of the Swedish and Norwegian mountains. If I could live anywhere in the world, it would be here.\"\nFor those planning to visit these Arctic reaches of Finland, there are accommodation options that make it a breeze to take a dip in lake Kilpisj\u00e4rvi. \"In case you don't have your own gear to cut an ice hole, you can visit Kilpisj\u00e4rvi Lapland Hotel's sauna and their ice hole, which is kept open with pumps,\" M\u00e4kinen says.\nHowever, M\u00e4kinen tends to cut her ice holes herself, and made more than 10 of them here last year.\n\"While you can cut an ice hole in the middle of an Arctic lake, you should always pay attention to locals moving with snowmobiles, make sure the ice hole is properly marked and that no ice blocks are left on the lake,\" warns M\u00e4kinen. When asked if she's ever met other ice swimmers on her trips to Arctic lakes, M\u00e4kinen laughs: \"No, not swimmers. But ice hole fishers, yes. They walk over and say that I've made quite a big hole for fishing.\"\nWebsite: https://www.laplandhotels.com/FI/lapin-hotellit/kilpis/lapland-hotels-kilpis.html\nAddress: K\u00e4sivarrentie 14206, 99490 Kilpisj\u00e4rvi\nPhone: +358 16 323 300\nInstagram: @laplandhotels_kilpis\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.\nBesides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice. \nThis was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams. \nBut dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.\n1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.\nHyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four. \nLater, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.\nHyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.\nEventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea. \nIt took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk. \nOnce in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.\nWriting was the one thing he found solace in, he says. \nHe started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d\nAt first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap. \nGrowing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project. \nHyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself. \nBut it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle. \n\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South. \nBut gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine. \nKim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.\nComing from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.\nDue to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.\nBoth boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.\nUnlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.\n\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.\nBut their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.\nApart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d\nBut after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says. \n\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling. \nBut what do the other two boys think of their bandmates? \n\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.\nKenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.\n\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"\nLate last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group. \nThey aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans. \nDozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.\nSo it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs. \nWith human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.\nTo avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nKim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.\nA rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.\nOne academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit. \n\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.\nBut his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success. \n\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk. \n\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d",

        "article_text": "Following a TikTok ban in the US, phones and iPads with the TikTok app preinstalled are up for sale, and it seems some people are buying. Experts say it's a security disaster waiting to happen.\nIt may not seem like it, but TikTok is indeed banned in the United States. A law that bars the app went into effect on 19 January, causing it to brielfy go dark in the US before President Donald Trump issued an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension.\nBut Trump's order doesn't actually overturn the ban. Instead, it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now. And that has meant that some key organisations are still being cautious \u2013 including the app stores that allow users to download it in the first place. The\u00a0Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u00a0makes it illegal for app stores and internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance or updates of TikTok.\nAnd so far, Apple and Google are complying. In other words, you can still use TikTok if you already have it downloaded on your device. If not, you're out of luck.\nBut this has led to some people seeing an opportunity. Across the US, people on online marketplaces such as eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Esty and elsewhere are listing used phones with the TikTok app preinstalled \u2013 often for astronomical prices. In some cases they are asking for sums more in line with what you'd pay for a new car. You can pick one up for yourself, if you've got the money. The only question is how much of your digital security you're willing to risk.\nSome see an opportunity to cash in. One eBay seller, who spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity, has a Samsung Galaxy Note9 up for grabs. It's an older model that would normally expect to sell for around $250 (about \u00a3200). But with the TikTok app installed, the seller is asking for $50,000 (\u00a340,145). The price is negotiable though. \"The lowest I'll go is $15,000,\" the seller says. So far, they haven't seen any bids.\nOn TikTok, a number of American users have posted videos encouraging others to try and sell old devices with the app installed, promising big pay days. A Facebook Marketplace seller in New York says the videos inspired him. \"I don't know whether the app is really getting banned, but I'm going to try to get something from it,\" the seller says. His admittedly ancient iPhone is also marked at $50,000. \"I did it to see if I get lucky,\" he says.\nDo a simple search on an online marketplace and it is possible to find countless other iPhones, iPads and Android devices with TikTok on them for sale at similar prices. It seems unlikely anyone is going to shell out five figures, but many have sold for more reasonable sums already, at least according to a search of completed items on ebay. But in most cases, phones with TikTok installed aren't fetching any more than their usual price, few hundred to just over $1,000, depending on the model. It is also worth remembering that completed listings shouldn't always be taken at face value. But they can give you an idea of where the market has landed.\nThe listings make for an amusing anecdote, but there are real consequences at stake, according to Ryan McGrady, a researcher who studies the internet at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in the US.\u00a0\n\"You might think 'this is just an app,' but people become attached to online services and act out of desperation when they suddenly get taken away,\" McGrady says. And where there's desperation, you're sure to find criminals taking advantage. \"You just have to go back to the lesson of Flappy Bird,\" he says.\nFlappy Bird was a mobile game where users controlled a bird as it tried to fly between green pipes without hitting them. In 2013, Flappy Bird became such a sensation that the developer Dong Nguyen was reportedly making $50,000 (\u00a330,467) a day, until, out of nowhere, he pulled the game from the app store. At the time, Nguyen said he couldn't handle the stress of managing an \"addictive product\".\nAlmost immediately, scammers pounced. Phones with Flappy Bird installed flooded the market, as did copy-cat apps that promised to restore the lost game. The problem was many came loaded with viruses and malware. Some apps took control of the phone's text messages and started texting premium phone numbers, racking up charges on people's phone bills.\n\"It's a bad actor's dream to sell someone a phone that you know they're going to use all day without wiping it first. There could be anything loaded on these devices,\" McGrady says. \"If people were willing to take risks for Flappy Bird, you can bet they will cut the same corners to reconnect with people on TikTok.\"\nForlorn TikTok refugees are also sure to encounter instructions online for VPNs, jailbreaking techniques and other promised roads to bring back the app. It would be simple to steer unsuspecting users into a digital trap, McGrady says.\nIt's an unfortunately predictable outcome, particularly considering what the law banning TikTok was designed to do in the first place, he says.\u00a0\nThe US government's concerns about TikTok centred around its Chinese ownership. Specifically, lawmakers warn that China might use the app to harvest data, or influence the content users are seeing.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok: What happens when a social media app is banned\n\u2022\u00a0How America's porn wars could change your internet\n\u2022\u00a0What dies with TikTok? As a ban looms, Americans face a cultural void\nThe laws governing what companies can do with personal data in the US are a cluttered patchwork of rules.\u00a0Unlike Europe, there is no comprehensive privacy law in the US. By the same token, lawmakers across the world haven't shown any real movement towards meaningful laws about\u00a0algorithmic transparency, which could assuage fears about the content users are being served.\nIn TikTok's case, the potential issues haunting people who are looking to skirt around the ban may be short lived. On Monday, President Trump said Microsoft was in talks to make a deal with TikTok that would save the app, and many other buyers are reportedly on the line as well. In the meantime, though, you may want to think twice before you take out a loan for that $50,000 iPhone.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This ancient snack is synonymous with Tibetan New Year and will soon be prepared by millions of families.\nAt the entrance of the Kemgun Gumba monastery in Lukla, Nepal, an indigo-blue sign reads \"dining\". Inside, nearly a dozen women and a few men are hard at work, hunched over long tables, deftly mixing, rolling and slicing dough into thin rectangular strips. Each strip is slit in the middle, and one side of the dough is pulled into a ribbon-like bow. The rhythmic pounding of dough punctuates the crackle of oil sizzling in a large vessel outside, as boys and girls transform the doughy strips into deep-fried khapse (kha zas\u00a0in Tibetan), a sweet, crunchy snack central to Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists.\n\"Kha means 'mouth', and sey means 'snack',\" said chef Yeshi Jampa, co-author of the book Taste Tibet and founder of the eponymous Taste Tibet restaurant in Oxford. \"It's a symbol of [Tibetan] New Year,\" or Losar, he added.\nEvery year, millions of Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, India and elsewhere celebrate Losar (lo\u00a0means \"year\" and\u00a0gsar means \"new\"). The 15-day festival (which starts 28 February 2025) occurs on the first day of the Tibetan Lunar calendar and celebrates renewal and new beginnings. The first three days of the festival are considered the most important when followers visit monasteries, offer ceremonial scarves, receive blessings from Rinpoches (respected Tibetan teachers or lamas) and prepare special dishes with friends and family \u2013 especially khapse.\nEating khapse on Losar is thought to bring warmth, peace and tranquillity in the new year, and preparing it is both an art and a labour-intensive process. The dough (made of wheat flour, butter, sugar and oil with an optional egg) is kneaded, rolled and shaped into designs like flowers, knots and braids before being and fried in ghee (clarified butter).\nAccording to Geshema Delek Dolma, a nun at Dolma Ling Nunnery in northern India's Himachal Pradesh state, the history of khapse is intertwined with early Bon rituals \u2013 the indigenous religion practised across the Tibetan plateau before the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th Century CE \u2013 where blood offerings were made to deities.\n\"[Instead] of animal sacrifice, the custom evolved into offering khapse, which was sometimes coloured red as a symbolic gesture,\" Dolma said. \"The practice eventually spread to the other two provinces [Amdo and Kham] of\u00a0Tibet.\"\nKhapse-making is a communal activity.Itrequires many hands to prepare the honey-golden pastries in large quantities so it can be distributed to friends, family and across the community. So in the days ahead of Losar, family members come together to prepare large batches of khapse.\n\"It depends on how much quantity [of khapse] you have to make,\" said Kanchhi Maya Sherpa, who runs the Hotel Sherwi Hyul in Kathmandu. \"It's impossible for one [or] two people to make it as we need to knead the mixture together for a long time. Working together in the Gumba [monastery] is community work.\"\nFollowers first offer khapse to the deities as part of their religious practice, and afterwards, the crunchy treat is shared with others, including the poor, as a means of charity. \"This is always the tradition because Tibetans believe in the service of others before self,\" said Jampa.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Chhurpi: The world's hardest cheese?\n\u2022 The world's higest train line\n\u2022 After 100 hours in Tibet, I knew it was time to leave\nAs Jamyang Norbu, author of the book Echoes From Forgotten Mountains, notes on his blog, the first piece of khapse isn't actually eaten or offered. Instead, it's customary to shape the dough in a scorpion-shaped cookie, fry it and then place it outside the kitchen until \"the 15th day of the New Year to ward off bad luck and possible accidents that could take place during the [khapse]-making\".\n\"Traditionally, it was believed that making khapse could predict success for the upcoming year,\" explained Dolma. For example, oil spilling during the frying process was considered a bad omen. Jampa recalled an accident from his childhood that ruined his family's New Year celebrations. \"[It meant] evil,\" he said, noting how preparing the snack is steeped in cultural beliefs.\nKhapse recipes and the shapes the snack takes vary across regions and families. In Tibet's Markam County, where Jampa grew up, khapse was traditionally sweetened with organic honey from their beehives instead of sugar. Khapse made with honey \"makes the biscuit a little softer\", he explained. \"The sweetness of honey-made khapse arrives more slowly.\" In contrast, recipes that call for sugar have a crunchier texture.\n\"Different parts of Tibet mould khapse differently [and] in different shapes,\" Jampa said. \"I am from Kham. In my village, we make less ornate\u00a0khapse, known as\u00a0kong-chen \u2013 a narrow rectangular piece of dough with a cut in the middle through which one side of the\u00a0khapse\u00a0is pulled through.\" Another style, the hrug-hrug, \"are basically just small rectangles or triangles of dough that require no further work\", Jampa explained.\nKhapse is also deeply connected to Buddhist rituals. During Losar, flowers, fruits, grains, nuts, salt, butter and water are placed on the altar, as offerings to deities, alongside stacks of khapse arranged in towers called derga.\n\"Derga khapses are different shapes, compared to the khapses that we eat,\" my Tibetan friend, Tenzin Diki, told me. \"We add khapse in the shape of a crescent moon and a sun on the derga. We also add beautiful kharu (smaller, ornately designed pieces of khapse) on the derga, and decorate it with chhurpi [traditional cheese], sweets [and] rock sugar.\"\nToday, these fried cookies have evolved in style and shape and are eaten throughout the year. Khapse is sold year-round at stores in Kathmandu and many families prepare it as a snack outside of Losar. A quick online search for \"khapse\" or \"khapsey\" shows legions of home chefs and food bloggers experimenting with moulding the cookies and preparing them with additional ingredients like banana, beetroot, spinach and more.\n\"These days, people have modernised khapse, using their creativity, adding motifs to shape it differently,\" Sherpa explained. \"The shapes now depend on how much creativity one has. You can make it in any shape you want.\"\nYet, not everyone embraces these innovations. \"We have to keep traditional things traditional,\" said Jampa. \"[Khapse] is a special ceremony snack, a symbol of family effort and [it] reminds us that it is something special.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.\nEveryone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.\nBut there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.\nLamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.\nWhen the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\". \nBut he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"\nThat lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity. \nIn playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.\nThe performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.\nDrake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.\nSunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.\nBut the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight. \nHe performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).\nActor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.\n\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie. \n\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"\nIt was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience. \n\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.  \n\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set. \n\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d\nAnd whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying. \nEarly highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.\nThe set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.\nUnlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.\nSZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.\nNot Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\". \nHe was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".\nFor fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies. \nCasual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.\nAnd it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.\nThe phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.\nMany had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake. \nNonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.\nThe only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.\nThe NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.\nThe career-spanning set crammed 11 songs into 13 minutes. Here's what Kendrick played.\nBefore the show, it had been rumoured that Taylor Swift might swoop down from her VIP suite to join Lamar on stage.\nThe pair duetted on a remix of her single Bad Blood in 2015 - and fans hoped they might perform it live for the first time at the Super Bowl.\nIn the end, Swift opted just to watch the show, along with other celebrity attendees including Paul McCartney, Stormzy, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Ice Spice, Doechii, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Winnie Harlow.\nMaybe it was for the best: Some reports suggested that Swift had been booed at the stadium, where almost 80% of fans supported the Philadelphia Eagles, rather than her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team.\nBefore kick-off, Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance on Bourbon Street, in the middle of New Orleans' historic French Quarter.\nThe star, who played her own Super Bowl half-time show in 2017, played a touching rendition of her song Hold My Hand, honouring the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack that claimed the lives of 14 people in the city.\nGaga was surrounded by first responders as she played a black baby grand piano in the middle of the road.\n\"Here on Bourbon Street, always the heart and soul of New Orleans, this year began with a terror attack that tried to shatter its spirit,\" said former American footballer Michael Strahan during the pre-filmed segment. \n\"But the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country.\"\nMusical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.\nMusician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful - giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.\nAnd just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano.",

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump's fortunes took a downturn in the 90s and he needed to raise cash fast, he sailed his 282ft (85m) superyacht, the Trump Princess, to Asia hoping he could attract Japan's wealthy.\nIt wasn't the first time the businessman had sought out Japanese buyers or lenders for his projects.\nIn the cut-throat world of New York real estate, Trump had a front-row seat from his Fifth Avenue skyscraper of Tokyo's buying spree in the 80s of iconic US brands and properties, including Rockefeller Center.\nIt was then that his worldview on trade and America's relations with its allies was formed, and his fixation on tariffs, a tax on imports, began.\n\"He had a tremendous resentment for Japan,\" says Barbara Res, a former executive vice-president at the Trump Organization.\nHe watched with jealousy as Japanese businessmen were viewed as geniuses, she says. He felt America wasn't getting enough in return for assisting its ally Japan with military defence.\nTrump often complained that he had difficulties doing deals with large groups of Japanese businessmen.\n\"I'm tired of watching other countries ripping off the United States.\"\nThat Trump quote could've been pulled from 2016, but it's actually from the late 80s when he made an appearance on CNN's Larry King Live, around the time he first floated his name as a potential presidential candidate.\nFresh from sharing his business philosophy in his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, Trump went on a tirade against America's trade policies in national interviews.\nIn an animated interview with Oprah Winfrey before a live studio audience on The Oprah Show, he said he would handle foreign policy differently by making the country's allies \"pay their fair share\".\nHe added that there wasn't free trade when Japan was \"dumping\" products into America's market but making it \"impossible to do business\" there.\nJennifer Miller, an associate professor of history at Dartmouth College, said others shared his concerns about the economy at the time.\nJapan provided competition for US manufacturing, particularly in consumer electronics and cars. As US factories were shuttering and new Japanese brands entered the market, pundits were talking about Japan surpassing the US as the world's leading economy.\n\"Trump is sort of symbolic of a lot of people who were kind of questioning American leadership in the American-led international order, and whether it actually served the United States,\" Prof Miller says.\nBefore his Oprah appearance, Trump had spent almost $100,000 to release an \"open letter\" in full-page ads in three major US newspapers. \nThe headline read: \"There's nothing wrong with America's Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can't cure.\"\nIn it, he said Japan and other nations had been taking advantage of the US for decades. He claimed \"the Japanese, unimpeded by the huge costs of defending themselves (as long as the United States will do it for free), have built a strong and vibrant economy with unprecedented surpluses\".\nTrump believed the obvious solution was to \"tax\" these wealthy nations.\n\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help,\" he wrote.\nANALYSIS: The tariff wars have begun - buckle up\nEXPLAINER: Why is Trump threatening tariffs?\nGLOBAL: Trump hit China hard before. This time it's ready\nCONSUMERS: Six things that could be more expensive in US\nVOICES: Canadians 'snap' as rift with US widens\nThe ad served as a potent introduction to Trump's foreign policy vision, according to Prof Miller. One built on the zero-sum belief that allies are freeloaders and that the liberal internationalist approach which had dominated since World War II was weak and foolish in a competitive world. The solution, he argued, was a more aggressive, protectionist trade policy.\n\"I think that's one reason he likes tariffs so much, is they fit not only with his transactional ideology but his sense of himself, which is very deeply rooted as this successful dealmaker,\" she said. \"And the fact that tariffs can be threatened; they can be dangled over another country.\"\nClyde Prestowitz headed negotiations with Japan during the Reagan administration as counselor to the secretary of commerce. A longtime critic of free-trade policies, he said nobody who was intellectually serious was affiliated with Trump or his simplistic approach at the time. He argues that the president hasn't offered a real solution to the problems he's raised.\n\"Tariffs are kind of a showy thing that you can say, look what I did, I banged those guys\u2026 so you know, you can be a tough guy. Whether or not they are effective in any way is really open to discussion.\"\nMr Prestowitz believes the real problem then and now is that the US doesn't have a strategic manufacturing policy, despite complaining about unfair trade.\nOf course, fears of Japan's rise calmed over time and now it's an ally. Instead it's China that is the US's fiercest corporate competitor. This week Trump welcomed Japan's prime minister into the Oval Office as one of his first foreign visitors.\nBut Donald Trump's governing philosophy is still the same as when he was a young real estate developer. He still believes just as strongly in tariffs as a tool to pressure other countries to open their markets and reduce trade deficits.\n\"He just says this all the time to anybody who will listen whenever anybody asks, and that's been true for 40 years. And in fairness to him, you know that is a very natural way to view international commerce,\" said Michael Strain, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\nHe says students often share Trump's intuitive thinking about the economy, and one of the big challenges that professors face is convincing them that their understanding is wrong.\nMr Strain says despite Trump's hold on the party, with a stance that has upended decades of Republican embrace of free trade, he doesn't think he's convinced sceptical lawmakers, business leaders and economists.\nThe sticking points remain that his views that foreign imports are bad, that the size of the trade deficit is a useful measure of policy success or that the ideal state for the US economy is to only import goods that cannot physically be made in the US.\nMr Strain believes threats to increase tariffs on US allies could reduce business investment and weaken international alliances.\nJoseph LaVorgna, a chief economist of the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, believes there's been too narrow a focus on tariffs and not enough of an attempt to understand the big picture of what Trump is trying to accomplish.\nHe says the president wants to galvanise domestic industry, in particular high-tech manufacturing. \nThe administration, he explains, feels they can encourage more corporations to come to the US using tariffs, combined with deregulation, cheaper energy and lower corporate taxes, if enacted by Congress.\n\"I think that President Trump understands something which is very important, being a businessman and being transactional, and that is free trade is great in theory but in the real world you need to have fair trade and that's a level playing field.\"\nHe is betting Donald Trump is right. Few Republicans have publicly opposed the president as he demands loyalty to his agenda. \nStill, some who have remained silent understand that their constituents could be impacted by rising prices, and are hoping they can convince Trump not to follow through with his beloved tariffs.",

        "article_text": "Manchester City protested the awarding of Leyton Orient's goal\nFootball fans have become accustomed to debating the use of technology in the game over recent years - but in the FA Cup fourth round, its absence has provided a frequent talking point.\nWith video assistant referee technology only in use from the fifth round onwards this season, there have been a number of controversial incidents to dissect.\nAnd after incidents on Friday and Saturday, there was another on Sunday when Dominic Hyam's header was disallowed for offside in Blackburn's defeat by Wolves - when replays suggested he was onside.\n\"My initial thought was they'll check that,\" said ex-Rovers goalkeeper Paul Robinson on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"It looks extremely tight. If there was VAR they'd be drawing the lines.\"\nSome liked VAR's absence, such as Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler, whose side might have had their winner against Chelsea disallowed for a Tariq Lamptey handball.\n\"But that's it. That's football,\" he told BBC Sport. \"With VAR, football is getting not that emotional like it was today. \n\"Everyone agrees with me that today was a great atmosphere. You can celebrate a goal because you are certain it's a goal. I'm happy it was like that.\"\nSome were less convinced, including his Chelsea counterpart Enzo Maresca - whose side might still be in the FA Cup with VAR.\n\"I think the handball is quite clear.

        "article_text": "Home to the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US, this desert-bound city boasts a fascinating food scene all its own.\nThe shady portico of San Xavier del Bac Mission, a whitewashed oasis set against the cactus-studded mountains of the Sonoran Desert, offered a brief reprieve from Arizona's scorching summer sun as I walked with local chef Ryan Clark. The stucco mission, known as the \"White Dove of the Desert\", was founded in 1700 when this part of Arizona belonged to New Spain, but Clark was more excited to arrive at nearby San Xavier Co-op Farm on the Tohono-O'odham reservation.\n\"The ground you're standing on is where agriculture in the United States began,\" Clark told me. \"Approximately 4,200 years ago, the ancestors of the Tohono O'odham transitioned from hunting and foraging in the desert to planting corn. These plots hold the oldest continuously cultivated soil in our nation.\"\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of when Tucson became the first city in the US to be named a Unesco City of Gastronomy, joining the ranks of Parma, Italy; Chengdu, China; and Lyon, France as a centre of global culinary importance. The Unesco designation was a nod to the city's deep-seated agricultural roots and has transformed Tucson into a culinary travel destination while also inspiring chefs, bakers, brewers and distillers to incorporate the area's traditional ingredients in new ways. Today, alongside iconic staples like birria tacos and Sonoran hot dogs, you'll find American Single Malt whiskey smoked in mesquite, artisanal chocolate made with chiltepin chilli and Michelin-worthy tasting menus showcasing the desert's bounty.\nTucsonan cuisine reflects the many disparate peoples who have called the Sonoran Desert home over the centuries \u2013 a colourful stew of influences from Indigenous nations, Spanish settlers, Anglo American cowboys and Chinese railroad workers. As Carolyn Niethammer, the author of the book A Desert Feast: Celebrating Tucson's Culinary Heritage, writes: \"Tucsonan cuisine was fusion long before fusion became popular.\"\nSince 1983, Native Seeds/SEARCH, a Tucson-based seed bank, has preserved hundreds of near-extinct seeds from the American Southwest, often in partnership with Indigenous communities.In recent years, annual culinary celebrations like the Agave Heritage Festival (10-13 April) and Sonoran Restaurant Week (6-14 September) highlight chefs and distillers working with traditional desert ingredients.\nThe best of 2025\nTucson, Arizona was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list here.\nAccording to Niethammer, the foundation of Tucsonan cuisine took shape four millennia ago, when Sonoran Indigenous societies foraged the desert for cacti, small game, wild seeds and grasses.\n\"Sonoran hunter-gatherers were remarkable botanists, capable of identifying hundreds of edible plants from this seemingly inhospitable land,\" Niethammer said. Mashed mesquite pod porridge sweetened with prickly pear fruits was a staple, and cholla cactus buds sustained Indigenous groups during lean times. Cholla buds were crucial staples in March, a time the Tohono-O'odham called \"the month without food\", due to dwindling food stores and plunging temperatures. To season game like jackrabbits, javelina and mule deer, the Tohono O'odham turned to chiltepin chillies, blisteringly hot peppers and mesquite wood, which infused meat with sweet, piquant smoke.\nMany of these ancient ingredients remain mainstays in contemporary Tucsonan kitchens. At The Hub Restaurant and Ice Creamery, chef Kayla Draper, a local resident and member of the Navajo Nation, adds ground mesquite pods into tiramisu to add a nutty, molasses-like flavour to the classic Italian treat. Draper pairs her mesquite tiramisu with scratch-made prickly pear sorbet. A dram from Whiskey Del Bac, a local distillery smoking malt with mesquite wood, adds a final exclamation point to the desert dessert. In homage to the food of her Navajo ancestors, Draper makes blue corn macarons and corn masa ice cream encased in a chocolate-chiltepin shell.\nMeanwhile, cholla buds are a favourite salad topping for chef Clark. \"We call cholla buds 'desert asparagus'. They have a chewy bite like a semi-cooked beet,\" Clark said. \"The clean, herbaceous flavours pair well with a light vinaigrette.\"\nAs Niethammer explained, the diet of the Sonoran desert's early residents transformed with the advent of agriculture here in roughly 2200 BCE, which likely came from contact with Mesoamerican cultures. \"Corn was the first crop the ancestors of the Tohono-O'odham planted,\" Niethammer said. \"Ancient corn, domesticated from a Oaxacan wild grass called teosinte, was only about three inches long, and the Tohono O'odham still relied on foraging and hunting even after adopting agriculture.\"\nSquash became part of the Sonoran diet around 800 CE and shortly thereafter, beans. \"Beans require a heat-resistant vessel to cook, so they likely only became a Sonoran staple after the Indigenous people learned how to make pottery,\" Niethammer told me. Squash, beans and corn became known as The Three Sisters: a nutritious trio still relished in Tucson from roadside diners to white-tablecloth dining rooms like Maynards Kitchen, located near the the historic Hotel Congress.\nTucsonan cuisine evolved again in the late 16th Century, when Father Eusebio Kino and a small group of Spanish missionaries settled in the Santa Cruz Valley. Pork, beef and Mediterranean crops like figs, quince, olives, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 wheat joined The Three Sisters and desert herbs in Sonoran larders.\n\"The primary goal for the Spanish was to convert the Indigenous people to Catholicism, and they needed wheat for communion wafers,\" Niethammer said. \"Father Kino planted a desert-adapted grain called [white Sonora wheat]. Today, you'll still find [it], a relative of winter wheat, across Tucson.\" Low in gluten content, white Sonora wheat is ill-suited for making bread but adds a delightful nutty flavour to biscuits and tortillas. At Barrio Bread, a Tucson bakery specialising in heritage grains, head baker Don Guerra mixes the wheat into his dough to make ciabatta rolls, bolillos (soft, torpedo-shaped bread rolls), and baguettes. In 2022, Guerra won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Baker.\nMore like this:\n \u2022 France's most elaborate and macabre recipe\n \u2022 The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n \u2022 The return of Cambodia's banned cuisine\nAnother major culinary transformation happened when the US acquired what is now Tucson in 1854. Soon after the Gadsden Purchase, in which the US acquired Arizona from Mexico, the Southern Pacific Railroad reached Tucson. Anglo American ranchers poured in, introducing canned fish and meats and cowboy barbecue. Chinese railroad workers also brought new ingredients and dishes.\n\"Many rail workers had been farmers in China, and they pioneered the cultivation of new crops like strawberries, lettuce and soybeans in the [nearby] Santa Cruz Valley,\" Niethammer said. Adjusting to available ingredients and the palates of their customers, Chinese grocers sold Chinese chorizo, pork sausage seasoned with soy sauce, rice wine and chilli. Today, the annual Chinese Chorizo Festival (held in October), celebrates this Sino-Sonoran sausage in sushi, fried rice and even cocktails.\n\"Tucson may not have as many glitzy restaurants as Phoenix or Scottsdale,\" Draper told me. \"But our food is more distinctive and soulful, and we Tucsonans take pride in our culinary heritage \u2013 especially after the Unesco recognition.\" For visitors eager to learn about Tucsonan cuisine, she recommends tours with Taste of Tucson, which leads gourmet excursions through the city's historic downtown as well as off-the-beaten-track neighbourhoods.\nDraper also recommends Zio Peppe, which has been attracting pizza aficionados from across the US with pies made from mesquite-flour and garnished with pickled cholla buds since it opened in 2021. Elsewhere, BATA, one of Bon Appet\u00edt's best new restaurants in 2022, has garnered national buzz for its live fire cooking and creative Sonoran dishes like squash ice cream. Tucson's distillers and brewers also are embracing heritage ingredients. Crooked Tooth Brewing Co. crafts a prickly pear sour beer, and on the harder side of the ABV spectrum, Whiskey del Bac produces a Scotch-style whiskey with barley smoked with mesquite wood rather than traditional peat.\nOn my last night in Tucson, chef Clark and I knocked back a round of prickly pear margaritas at Ventana Canyon before heading to Fourth Avenue, the so-called \"heartbeat of Tucson\", lined with elegant Mission Revival architecture and boisterous bars. After dark, food carts selling Sonoran hot dogs, a classic late-night snack, congregate here. As the franks sizzled on a small grill and the cook heaped beans, cheese and salsa on a steamed bolillo bun, Clark waxed poetic.\n\"You see all the culinary layers of Tucson in a Sonoran hotdog: beans and chillies from the Indigenous Sonorans; bolillo buns from the Spanish; and bacon, cheese and tubed meat from Anglo Americans.\" And Chinese influences? Clark suggested I return next October for the Chinese Chorizo Festival. Spooning pickled jalapenos onto his hot dog, Clark said, \"A cheesy dog with beans and salsa: quintessentially American and quintessentially Tucsonan.\"\nTucson, Arizona was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.

        "article_text": "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.\nCarbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.\nIn October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.\nBut on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.\n\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.\nSpeaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.\n\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said. \nHe added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals. \nThe UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.\nBut a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.\nBoth the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\nBy 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.\nThe funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.\nDr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.\n\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.\nAlthough there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.\nBut Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.\nThe committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.\nThe committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.\nBut it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.\n\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.\nHis committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.\nThe government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.\n\nMirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.\n\"We argue that carbon storage mandates on fossil fuel producers are fair whilst also providing the kind of investment certainty that companies need,\" she said.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed never visited India, his artworks are set to be displayed in the country for the first time. \nStarting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings.\nThe collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dal\u00ed's friend and publisher.\n\"Dal\u00ed was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,\" Ms Argillet told the BBC.\nSome of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests.\nDal\u00ed's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. \nIn his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. \n\"Appreciating Dal\u00ed's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,\" Ms Argillet says.\nBringing Dal\u00ed's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition.\n\"The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,\" Ms Aggarwal says. \nStrictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dal\u00ed's creations have come to India. In 1967, Dal\u00ed famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers.\nIn return, Dal\u00ed demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed.\nShe finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dal\u00ed had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out).\nDal\u00ed's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality.\nBorn in Spain in 1904, Dal\u00ed grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Andr\u00e9 Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dal\u00ed.\nThe surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by Andr\u00e9 Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was \"dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason\", according to Breton.\nDal\u00ed was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges.\nConsequently, Dal\u00ed's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. \n\"Dal\u00ed was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,\" Ms Argillet says.\nThe artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dal\u00ed revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache.\n\"Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,\" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache.\nIn the same interview, he described his moustache as being \"very gay, very pointed, very aggressive\".\nMs Argillet, who knew Dal\u00ed intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dal\u00ed being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and \"shocking the bourgeois\".\nHe once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover.\n\"At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,\" Ms Argillet says. \nBut she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dal\u00ed's shyness that made him over-perform in public.\n\"He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dal\u00ed, just like his paintings,\" Ms Argillet says.\n\"The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dal\u00ed.\"\nThe exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March.",

The first half was far from perfect, we should have scored at least three tries. Had we done so, the match would have been completely different.\n\"They were pragmatic - every time they entered our half, they scored.

They were clinical, they controlled how and where the game was going to be played.\"\nJohnson added: \"Scotland didn't really have any attitude in the first half, they almost didn't believe they could win the game, they made mistakes and they made it too easy for Ireland.

In June 1992, just a month or two after the Muslic family left Bihac, it fell under a three-year siege by Serb-led forces during a bitter civil war. \n\"We had to leave Bosnia, and Bihac, our hometown, literally overnight, grabbing things you can grab with your hands,\" he explains powerfully to BBC Sport.\n\"That's where our journey, or our new life, started.\"\nThousands were forced to flee Muslic's hometown of Bihac when it came under siege in 1992\nMuslic, his sister and parents fled 400 miles (650km) to Innsbruck in Austria with no idea what they would find and unable to speak the language with the local German accent, particularly hard to understand.\n\"We struggled our whole life, and this part of struggling is part of my journey, and that's why I'm always very optimistic and very positive,\" says Muslic, who guided Cercle Bruges to the Uefa Europa Conference League this season.\n\"I've been in more challenging situations in my life than being a head coach and facing a possible draw or a defeat at the weekend.\n\"And that's also the message I want to deliver consistently towards the players, that life is a struggle with beautiful surprises, and there is always something worth fighting for.\n\"Nothing was easy for me, or for my family or for my sister. We became refugees, and it's not a pretty thing, but I never had the feeling that I missed something in my life.\n\"My parents tried very hard to provide us with the things that we needed - my father worked for over 30 years as a waiter, my mother was a cleaning lady, and they tried very hard to give us a good life.\n\"All the things that have happened over the last 30 years helped me become who I am today and also achieve some things that maybe have been impossible.\n\"But nothing is impossible if you truly believe, if you commit, if you convince, and if you go really, really fully.\"\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

        "article_text": "Copenhagen's once-industrial port has been planned to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes.\nWhile cruising the canals of Copenhagen in the summer of 2023, my guide pointed out Nordhavn, the city's once-industrial neighbourhood, excitedly claiming it would become the coolest new city in Europe. From the boat, I couldn't see much beyond a few residential buildings and lots of giant construction machinery, but, as an architect, I was interested to know more.\nSo, 12 months later, I returned to Copenhagen and headed back to Nordhavn, just a 15-minute metro ride from Copenhagen's central station.\u00a0\nThis time, standing at \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, the core of the new development, I could see gleaming apartment buildings, high-end office spaces and a cafe-lined boardwalk along the previously industrial harbour. Dozens of people were lying on colourful beach towels spread across the waterfront, all soaking in the Scandinavian summer sun. It was a peaceful, serene scene, with none of the morning commuter chaos I was used to seeing in cities around the world.\nAnd that's because Nordhavn has been specifically designed to make life easier.\n\"Although it looks like any modern district, it's the world's first five-minute city,\" explained my guide, Bente Hoffman from immersive cultural tour company Slow Tours. \"When the project is complete, everything you need will be within a 400m walk.\"\nCommuting is one of the biggest challenges of modern life as it adds so much time into the daily routine. Nordhavn (officially a district of Copenhagen, but described as a city due to its scale and scope) has been designed to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes. It is setting a blueprint for a world where residents can fit in a morning workout before strolling to the office, grab lunch at a cute cafe, have a quick swim at the harbour and still make it home in time to take your kids to the playground \u2013 all before enjoying a cosy candlelit dinner at home.\nImagine doing all of this without driving from one point to another, without feeling exhausted, and being able to repeat it every day while staying carbon neutral.\n\"We are creating a neighbourhood that meets everyday needs and special occasions,\" explained Peter Bur Andersen, an architect from BRIQ Studios that played a crucial role in zoning Nordhavn. \"Everything is within walking or biking distance, minimising the need for commuting. The area also promotes a mostly car-free lifestyle, connected by cycle paths and the metro.\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nCopenhagen is currently the Unesco World's Architecture Capital (until 2026) and innovative solutions for smart living have been brewing across the Danish capital: from Paper Island, designed to focus on public spaces and housing for all income groups; to Carlsberg City District that's built on four pillars of beer production: science, innovation, art and culture.\nHowever, Nordhavn's five-minute city concept is unique. While there are a few 10-minute cities being developed around the world, including one in Seoul, South Korea, Nordhavn's one-of-a-kind concept is the most ambitious urban development project in Scandinavia. It is also the only new urban district anywhere in the world to receive a gold certification for sustainability from the German Sustainable Building Council, or DGNB (the largest network for sustainable building in Europe), according to Andersen.\nIn Nordhavn, sustainability is about more than reducing energy consumption. Every building constructed must consider its social, economic and environmental impact. For example, the Big Bio Cinema \u2013 the city's newest theatre \u2013 is constructed from recyclable materials such as aluminium in case the building ever needs to be demolished.\nTop tips:\nWhen to go: June-August for warmer weather.\nWhat to do: Take a guided walking tour. Explore the design shops in the harbour area. Head to Konditaget L\u00fcders, a carpark rooftop that serves as an open-air public gym. Watch a movie at Big Bio Cinema.\nWhere to stay: Audo House, a former warehouse transformed into a boutique hotel with a caf\u00e9 and concept store.\nWhere to eat:\n- Located on the 17th floor of a former grain silo, Restaurant Silo has impressive views and a seasonal menu.\n- Headed by Rosio Sanchez, a former dessert chef from Noma, Hija de Sanchez Cantina\u00a0is a two-minute walk from the Sandkaj Harbour.\n- Palmar\u00e8s Bike Caf\u00e9 is a unique spot for cyclists, offering coffee, croissants and a bike workshop, with bike parts as d\u00e9cor.\nAnd, according to Anderson, social and economic inclusion has been at the core of all planning. \"It is important to bring back what worked well in history,\" he said. \"We used to have the butcher, craftsman, baker and cheese shop \u2013 that diversity in everyday encounters. The future city should mix recreational, cultural and commercial spaces, all easily accessible within the neighbourhood.\"\nBut until relatively recently, no one would have considered living in this once-industrial district. Irshia Nasreen, an engineer born and raised in central Copenhagen, says, \"While I was trying to find a new neighbourhood to move out of the city centre, I never thought I'd move here.\"\nBente adds, \"I didn't think I would do tourist walks in Norhavn. There was nothing to see.\"\nAfter all, for centuries Nordhavn was a free port filled with cargo ships, grain silos and metal containers. The buildings that existed were warehouses and industrial shipping structures. Then, in 2008, a competition was held to create a sustainable neighbourhood for Copenhagen's future: 179 proposals were submitted and a group of four architectural firms, COBE Architects, Sleth, Ramb\u00f8ll and Polyform were winners.\nThey designed an urban area of \"soft mobility\", where it is easier to walk, bike or use public transport than it is to drive; and put the idea of hybrid spaces \u2013 something that \"avoids creating lifeless spaces and fosters community among residents, employees and visitors\", according to Andersen \u2013 at its heart. For example, in Nordhavn, a multi-storey car park might have a gym on its roof; an apartment building could include a public restaurant; and a hotel could house a concept store.\nAlthough the entire Nordhavn project won't be finished until 2060, it is being developed in islets (small islands), with key areas such as Nord\u00f8 and \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, already complete and full of life, brimming with locals and tourists. A metro extension to Nordhavn and Orientkaj opened in 2020, providing easy access from the city centre.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0Kamikochi: Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n\u2022\u00a0How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nAs Hoffman and I walked through Nord\u00f8, I admired the ingenuity of using once-unassuming buildings to create chic destinations. Audo House, a warehouse from 1918, is now a boutique hotel, concept store and cafe. Across the road, MENY food supermarket was once a factory for building guns. Because of the building's protected status, MENY had to use the same walls, windows and ceilings as the former World War Two gun factory to create what is now a futuristic food market. Nearby, the raw steel surface of The Silo still resembled its days as a grain silo. But it has now been transformed into a luxurious 17-storey residential building with a public restaurant.\n\"The beauty of Nordhavn lies in the blend of old and new architecture standing side by side,\" said Hoffman. \"Sustainability is also about preserving the past by repurposing old buildings for modern use.\"\nNasreen moved to Nordhavn in 2023 and says the calm, car-free environment has transformed her lifestyle. \"I love walking around here,\" she said. \"After living in the city centre for 40 years, not hearing the hums of vehicles is refreshing. The proximity of water to all residential areas gives a sense of peace and fresh air. My nephew is awed by the fact that he can swim in the harbour, walk back home for a shower and then go back to the waterfront to enjoy coffee in a cool caf\u00e9. Isn't that amazing?\"\nCarbon emissions:\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 1.57 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nShe added: \"I work from home, and when I need a change of scenery, I head to The Audo House. It's a multifunctional space, so you see tourists checking in the hotel and people shopping for art and furniture while I have a coffee in its cafe on a winter afternoon.\"\nIn the early 20th Century, when legendary Danish designer Arne Jacobsen said, \"Architecture is not just about creating buildings; it's about shaping the environment and enhancing people's lives,\" it was theoretical. A century later, Hoffman is leading curious designers and architects like me on walking tours around Nordhavn. As curious as I am, and perhaps with the same intent, they are looking for answers to the question: can architecture be one of the keys to creating a happier urban environment?\u00a0\nFor Nasreen and many others living in Nordhavn, the answer is a resounding yes.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.\nA night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How opera can be 'open to everyone'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is the 'land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera House cut ties with its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to a UK study conducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work \u2013 and opera houses are no exception.\nThe pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive the Theatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes \u2013 sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations \u2013 spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.\nA key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. \"Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,\" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentary Take Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne. \n\u00a0\nIn 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: \"I know that many opera companies\u2026 don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.\"\nGlyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the global Race to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. \"We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,\" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. \"We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine.\" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. \"Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,\" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. \"This way everything goes back into the ground.\"\nClimate action\nGlyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.\nThe rooftop of the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, for example, is host to an urban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.\nThe Sydney Opera House \u2013 a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 \u2013 has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021, a survey by the UK's Theatres Trust found that it would cost more than \u00a31bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.\nIn the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than \u00a0630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recent New York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting.\nElsewhere, the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon, G\u00f6teborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on a new project investigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first \"green season\", using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new \"eco-entertainment\" work titled Masque of Might.\nAs the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.\nTake Me to the Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne is on BBC News Channel and on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The 'missing middle' of small businesses\n\u2022\u00a0Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love\n\u2022\u00a0Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things\nWhere do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?\nMy perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.\nI'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "Dubai is synonymous with luxury and pampering, and Huda Beauty founder Huda Kattan knows where to find it. Here are her Dubai picks, from heavenly massages to crystal shopping.\nIn just half a century, the Emirati city of Dubai has gone from a small fishing village on the banks of the Dubai Creek to a thriving metropolis synonymous with over-the-top luxury. It's home to the Burj Khalifa \u2013 the world's tallest tower \u2013 and Deep Dive Dubai \u2013 the world's deepest pool \u2013 and it's now building the $2bn (\u00a31.64bn) mega-mall Dubai Square, the largest in the world.\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nBut even though it plays hard, Dubai doesn't forget to take care of itself; it was recently named the World's Best Spa Destination 2024 at the World Spa Awards.\nTo get to the heart of this burgeoning capital of self-care, we spoke to makeup artist-turned beauty mogul Huda Kattan, who has called Dubai home since 2008.\nThe SpeciaList\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nFor Kattan, who was born and raised in the United States but lived in the UAE for two years as a child, moving to Dubai was a homecoming. \"It's an extremely fast paced, multicultural environment,\" says Kattan, who travels endlessly around the globe for her work as the founder and CEO of Huda Beauty cosmetics. \"It's probably one of the fastest-moving [cities] I've ever seen. When I go to New York, New York is way too slow for me.\"\nKattan, whose brand headquarters is in Dubai, loves hitting the spa in her downtime. \"[It's] the best,\" she says. \"It's about going to the spas, enjoying the massages, doing the hammams, the facials. It's about investing in yourself for sure.\"\nAnd Dubai's foothold in the beauty world is also growing. Dior opened its first spa in the city in 2024 and the five-star Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab hotel with its three-storey spa will open in 2025. \"Dubai is definitely getting a lot more credibility in beauty,\" says Kattan. \"I have big celebrities asking me, 'What is happening in Dubai? What are all the treatments that people are doing?'\"\nBut self-care in Dubai isn't just about spa treatments; its glamorous shops are a strong prescription for retail therapy, while its stunning coastal panoramas refresh mind, body and soul.\nHere are Kattan's favourite ways to indulge in self-care in Dubai.\nKattan experienced her first-ever massage in Dubai 16 years ago and was instantly hooked. \"I'd never had a massage in my life until I moved here,\" she says. \"When I got my first massage, I fell asleep and was snoring and slobbering. I was like, 'What is this? This is the best experience of my life'. I now have them regularly.\"\nVisitors will find a massage to suit every budget, from designer spas to at-home mobile massages. Kattan is a fan of both, but enthuses that those looking to splurge can\u2019t go wrong with the Guerlain Spa at the One&Only The Palm hotel found on the tip of the manmade Palm Jumeriah island.\nThe Guerlain Spa features a leafy Arabic courtyard resplendent with regal fountains and a marble lobby with its own mini Guerlain boutique. Kattan was smitten from the moment she first stepped through the door. \"[It's] like a movie. It's amazing,\" she says.\nKattan usually goes for a deep tissue massage, while her husband, Portuguese businessman Christopher Goncalo, prefers the Thai massage technique. Kattan says she used to enjoy Swedish massages, but now she seeks out a sports massage treatment. \"I don't even want the relaxation anymore. I want them to work me out,\" she says. \u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.guerlain.com/ae/en-ae/guerlain-spa-one-and-only-the-palm-dubai.html \n Address: One&Only The Palm West Crescent, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai\n Phone: +971 4 440 1040\n Instagram: @guerlain/\nHammams \u2013 steam-filled public bathhouses \u2013 have been part of Middle Eastern culture as early as the 7th Century, serving not only as a place to wash off the desert sand, but a space to socialise.\nWhile modern plumbing has since been introduced, getting scrubbed clean in a room full of steam is still a hallmark of the Middle Eastern spa experience.\nTip:\n\"It's a very classy society,\" says Kattan. \"People will not look at you if you are dressed a certain way, but [they might] if you're maybe acting a little loud.\" Kattan says that she also had to take it down a notch: \"I'm American; we're very loud and I learned to adjust.\"\nKattan recommends the Talise Ottoman Spa on the West Crescent of The Palm. \"I went on my birthday. It was just the best experience,\" she says.\nThe cleansing ritual at Talise Ottoman Spa takes place in a domed marble room decorated in mosaics, where clients recline on a heated marble bed to have their skin exfoliated with a kese mitt, then revived with their choice of a honey, lavender and mint mask, or one made with purifying rose or gold.\nAfterwards, visitors can relax in one of the private majlis (cabanas) that surround a pool lit by a glittering chandelier. \"You sit there and they bring you a yogurt drink, dates and apricots,\" says Kattan. \"I was, like, I'm sure I'm in the 1600s and I'm a princess.\"\nWebsite: https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/dubai/jumeirah-zabeel-saray/wellbeing/signature-talise-ottoman-spa\n Address: Jumeirah Zabeel Saray, West Crescent, The Palm Jumeirah, Dubai \n Phone: +971 4 453 0455\n Instagram: @jumeirah \nTo truly indulge her senses, Kattan loves visiting fragrance stores.\nBedouins have been crafting seductive fragrances like heady oud from resinous woods or earthy frankincense from the gum of the Boswellia tree for centuries. \"Abdul\u00a0Samad Al Qurashi is I think the most luxurious, and they do really beautiful fragrances,\" says Kattan of the historic Saudi Arabian fragrance house, known for crafting fine fragrances since 1852. \"And Ajmal has a really beautiful store in Dubai Mall. There's also Hind Al\u00a0Oud. [Fragrance is] a big part of the culture.\"\nBut Kattan says visitors don\u2019t always need to splurge on expensive scents; they can seek out lesser-known brands: \"You can go to the souqs and buy little ones,\" she says. \"They're not necessarily ones you want to wear on a daily basis, but [the bottles are] cute trinkets. I would go to the souqs and buy the oils [and] ouds, and have [those] on my dresser.\"\nEmiratis enjoy layering their fragrance, starting with a base of oil on the pulse points, then spritzing fragrance all over the body and, finally, capturing the scent of bakhoor incense made from wood chips soaked in fragrant oils. \"They put their abaya (robe) on [the bakhoor]. Sometimes their hair will just take a little bit of smoke and it's quite beautiful,\" says Kattan. \"I've experienced it. It's amazing.\"\nWebsite: https://en-ae.ajmal.com/ \n Address: Ajmal Perfume, first floor, Dubai Mall\n Phone: +971-4-457-4111\n Instagram: @ajmalperfumes\nDubai has a global reputation as a go-to destination for luxury jewellery at tax-free prices, but when Kattan craves something sparkly, she splurges on decorative crystals.\n\"I have crystals everywhere. I'm a big crystal person,\" says Kattan, who loves placing them on windowsills and in bowls around her home in Dubai. Of the numerous glitzy crystal boutiques scattered throughout town, Kattan has a favourite: \"There's one crystal store called OOAKSTONES (One Of A Kind stones).\"\nLocated in Dubai's Alserkal Avenue arts district,\u00a0OOAKSTONES offers a highly curated selection of crystals, ranging from artisanal jewellery and statement pieces to home decor.\nKattan notes that in Dubai, crystals often cost around one-tenth the price one might spend elsewhere, and she believes visitors should make time for crystal shopping in their schedule. \"It's overwhelming and it's amazing and if you're coming to the Middle East [it's definitely something] you should do,\" says Kattan.\nWebsite: https://ooakstones.com/ \n Address: Warehouse 20 (Inside Kave), Alserkal Avenue, Dubai\n Phone: +971 52 481 6700\n Instagram: @ooakstones\nFrom dive-in cinemas and air-conditioned cabanas to loungers emblazoned with fashion brands, Dubai's beach clubs are an unabashedly glamorous affair.\nTip:\nDuring November and December, the desert temperature drops to a cool 25C. This Mediterranean-style weather can attract the crowds, so Kattan suggests choosing a hotel wisely during the high season. \"You're going to need to find a hotel in a really good location,\" says Kattan. \"I would not recommend The Palm [during peak months]. Getting in and out of it is a nightmare. I would recommend something more central.\" Kattan says that October and March are still great options for cooler months, but if you still want to go during peak season, Kattan jokes: \"Go to a hotel where you don't need to leave.\"\nKattan's go-to beach experience is SAL on the terrace of the seven-star Burj Al Arab Hotel, overlooking the Persian Gulf. \"It has a beautiful and calm setting with an amazing view. [It's the] perfect [place] to relax for the day,\" she says.\nSAL is open year-round, though Dubai's beach clubs are most popular during the cooler winter months. The trendy oasis features a stunning infinity pool and is home to the brand-new Sunset Lounge, a chic space with eye-catching mirrored walls. Guests can relax on the club's submerged pool loungers or hole up in one of the private air-conditioned cabanas complete with their own balconies and ensuite bathrooms. SAL also offers several poolside dining menus, with treats ranging from chilled starters and Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes to decadent desserts, as well as a luxe cocktail list and full shisha bar. Complimentary ice lollies and gazpacho shots add a touch of whimsy to the Gulf's glorious sunsets, and summertime visitors are welcome to stay until dark for a dip under the stars.\nWebsite: https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/dubai/burj-al-arab-jumeirah/dining/burj-al-arab-sal\n Address: Ground Mezzanine Floor, Burj Al Arab, Jumeirah Street, Dubai\n Phone: +971 800 323232\n Instagram: @sal_burjalarab\nThe upscale neighbourhood of Jumeriah is home to Lucia Aesthetic Dermatology Clinic; founded by renowned dermatologist Dr Radmila Lukian.

        "article_text": "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career. \nPop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times. \nThe trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison. \nA$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.\nHere's what you need to know about the case. \nA$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles. \nThe rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood. \nAuthorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.\nThe victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors \nThey were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.\nTheir relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous. \nIt all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021. \nMr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting. \nAuthorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement. \nThey met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \nProsecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\". \nCourt documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away. \nMr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show. \nThat's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.\nCourt documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles. \nAuthorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting. \nSome of this footage has been played in court already for jurors. \nThere are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries. \nThe rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers. \nHis lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident. \nCourt documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.\nHe also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.\n\nProsecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty. \nProsecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself. \nThere were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot. \nAt one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court. \nAnother associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture. \nWhen asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"\nTwelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.\nMr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\". \nMr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges. \nThe trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.\nAfter his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate. \nHe could. \nDuring court proceedings on Monday, his attorney told the judge that the rapper may take the stand on Tuesday or they would close their defence arguments - setting up the end of the trial. \nThe rapper is not legally obligated to testify. It's a risky move that would open him up to cross examination from prosecutors, but Mr Tacopina previously stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\". \nIf he testifies, the rapper is expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons. \nYes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks. \nA panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate. \nRihanna has continued to appear at the trial. \nBefore the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him. \nAt some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared. \nDuring the Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer. \nShe ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.\nDuring jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.\nRihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby. \nRocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of the cameras in the courtroom.",

Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.\nBut there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.\nLamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.\nWhen the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\". \nBut he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"\nThat lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity. \nIn playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.\nThe performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.\nDrake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.\nSunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.\nBut the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight. \nHe performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).\nActor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.\n\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie. \n\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"\nIt was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience. \n\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.  \n\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set. \n\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d\nAnd whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying. \nEarly highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.\nThe set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.\nUnlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.\nSZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.\nNot Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\". \nHe was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".\nFor fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies. \nCasual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.\nAnd it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.\nThe phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.\nMany had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake. \nNonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.\nThe only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.\nThe NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.\nThe career-spanning set crammed 11 songs into 13 minutes. Here's what Kendrick played.\nBefore the show, it had been rumoured that Taylor Swift might swoop down from her VIP suite to join Lamar on stage.\nThe pair duetted on a remix of her single Bad Blood in 2015 - and fans hoped they might perform it live for the first time at the Super Bowl.\nIn the end, Swift opted just to watch the show, along with other celebrity attendees including Paul McCartney, Stormzy, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Ice Spice, Doechii, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Winnie Harlow.\nMaybe it was for the best: Some reports suggested that Swift had been booed at the stadium, where almost 80% of fans supported the Philadelphia Eagles, rather than her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team.\nBefore kick-off, Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance on Bourbon Street, in the middle of New Orleans' historic French Quarter.\nThe star, who played her own Super Bowl half-time show in 2017, played a touching rendition of her song Hold My Hand, honouring the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack that claimed the lives of 14 people in the city.\nGaga was surrounded by first responders as she played a black baby grand piano in the middle of the road.\n\"Here on Bourbon Street, always the heart and soul of New Orleans, this year began with a terror attack that tried to shatter its spirit,\" said former American footballer Michael Strahan during the pre-filmed segment. \n\"But the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country.\"\nMusical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.\nMusician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful - giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.\nAnd just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano.",

        "article_text": "Ahead of Kendrick Lamar's headline performance at the Super Bowl half-time show in New Orleans, we explore the rapper's journey from the unforgiving streets of Compton to pop culture ubiquity.\n\"I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death?\" ponders a fiery and fed-up Kendrick Lamar on fan-favourite song Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst. Sounding like he's on his knees pleading to the man in the sky, the always-probing rapper finally answers his own question: \"Maybe it's because I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death!\"\nThe song considers how an inner-city experience within a racially-divided US tends to be based around constantly grappling with feelings of impending doom: a toxic cycle that's difficult to break free of. Filled with chest-deep empathy; a combination of hyper-animated lyrical perspectives (including a hopeless young man lost in gang activity as well as a sexually-abused girl damaged due to the foster care system); and an underlining morose wit, these raw, confessional lyrics signify why the Compton, Los Angeles rapper is regarded as one of hip-hop's greatest ever songwriters.\nThe esteemed North Carolina rap producer 9th Wonder\u00a0\u2013 who composed arguably the 20-time-Grammy-winning MC's most experimental song with the three-act psychodrama of DUCKWORTH\u00a0\u2013 told me back in 2023: \"Kendrick Lamar is more like a documentarian than an MC. Kendrick chooses to rap about everything and everyone across the social strata. People might call it 'woke' or 'deep', but I think of it as straight-up reporting. Some rappers leave out a certain section of people in their lyrics, right? Well, Kendrick tries to rap from everyone's perspective.\"\u00a0\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning artist\u00a0\u2013 who will perform as the half-time headliner for this Sunday's Super Bowl at the New Orleans Superdome, with R&B star SZA confirmed as a guest\u00a0\u2013 is that rare artist capable of making you see through the eyes of a troubled soul searching for salvation (How Much A Dollar Cost? reimagines God as a homeless man on Skid Row; Auntie Diaries considers the struggles of a transgender relative).\nHe can also consistently create loose, trunk-rattling hood anthems (see Money Trees) that convert highly chantable regional slang terms into trending words. For example, aside from a brilliant DJ Mustard beat that sonically feels like a tank blasting out quaking g-funk basslines while riding out to war, it's fair to say Lamar's urgent 2024 single tv off also went viral due to the hilarious yet highly-meme-able way the lead artist screamed out the word: \"Mustarrrrrrrrrddddddddddd!\"\nSuch was the success of this moment that Heinz are releasing a limited run of condiments, essentially turning Lamar's battle cry ad-lib into a slogan to sell mustard for hot dogs. This illustrates how the artist has always been able to consistently juggle rapping about social injustice\u00a0\u2013 even making a song with an earworm refrain (\"We're gonna be alright!\") that became an anthem for the global Black Lives Matter protest movement\u00a0\u2013 with approval from corporate and mainstream America.\nLamar can stand up for women's rights on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage one minute, then insinuate that rap rival Drake had relationships with underage women (something the Canadian artist denies) on a vicious but ubiquitous diss song, which followed a protracted feud between the two rappers, the next.\u00a0Last weekend, Not Like Us won the 2025 Grammy for song of the year; meanwhile Drake has taken legal action against record label Universal Music over the track.\nLamar adopts different guises much like his hero Tupac Shakur, playing both preacher and soldier \u2013 giving weight to both Martin Luther King's pacifism (LOVE), but also Malcolm X's \"by any means necessary\" approach to politics (The Blacker The Berry). It is ultimately this duality and versatility that makes the artist the perfect choice for this Sunday's Super Bowl half-time show, says Marcus J Moore, the music journalist and author behind The Butterfly Effect: How Kendrick Lamar Ignited The Soul of Black America. \"Sadly, there's still a segment of the [American] population that doesn't consider rap a viable genre in music, despite its popularity,\" he tells the BBC. \"Such thinking suggests racism and classism, but with Kendrick Lamar, he's the type of rapper who can make fans out of anyone. He's a rapper's rapper with a pop sensibility on stage. And while he's tremendous on his own, he's also had the benefit of guesting with bigger stars like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. I think Kendrick has done a great job over the years of making himself undeniable.\"\nTo understand what Lamar's upcoming Super Bowl performance might look like, you must go back to the artist's humble origins. Raised on 1612 West 137th Street in Compton, Los Angeles, Lamar was surrounded by a community filled with members of rival gangs the Bloods and the Crips, that always felt on the verge of chaos. One of his earliest memories was of the 1992 Watts riots, which were triggered by anger around the filmed beating of Rodney King by LAPD officers and the fact a trial ultimately failed to result in any tangible convictions. More than 50 people lost their lives because of this uprising.\n\"There was smoke everywhere and my dad had a bunch of stolen car rims [he had looted] in the back seat he took from the Compton Swap Meet,\" Lamar reflected in an interview with Signed Media. \"My pops and my uncle were both involved in the Watts riots! LA is very sensitive and prideful of its people. We literally burned down our old neighbourhoods because of our anger over Rodney King.\"\nThis rebellious spirit seeped directly into Lamar's raps, with the artist getting sharper and sharper with each new mixtape and album release. It was 2011's Section.80 that really turned industry heads, thanks to its playful tongue twisters (Rigamortus) and cryptic revolutionary songs (HiiiPoWeR) that dared people in Compton to \"get off that slave ship [and] build your own pyramids\". Turning the heads of Dr Dre and Interscope Records, Section 80 was quickly followed by Lamar's stunning major label debut LP, 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d city.\nAlmost instantly heralded as a classic, the album's three-dimensional, Dickensian storytelling reflected the tug-of-war experience of Lamar's own childhood, where staying on the righteous path was a constant battle, especially when drive-by shootings were going on outside the family's living room window. One of the key factors that made this Top Dawg Entertainment (the label that also hosts Doechii, SZA, and Schoolboy Q) record so great, according to 9th Wonder, was how it subverted gangsta rap cliches. \"Some rappers do come from good homes with loving moms and dads!\" he says. \"Not everyone comes from a hardback struggle, or has to be a bad kid just because they come from a bad place. Kendrick knows the power of telling simple American stories about ordinary people doing their best.\"\nThe importance of no album sounding the same as the last seemed to be a rule Lamar followed to the letter. In the years that followed his debut, he consistently took bold left turns, experimenting with avant-garde jazz on 2015's To Pimp a Butterfly and a psychedelic stadium rap sound (PRIDE) on 2017's DAMN. Arguably the biggest risk came with 2022's double album Mr Morale & The Big Steppers, where Lamar brutally dissected his own psyche, admitting to cheating on his partner while touring overseas in Scandinavia and urging fans not to treat his raps too much like dissectible prophecies.\n\"The cat is out the bag, I am not your saviour!\" was one of many of this project's fall-on-your-own-sword lyrics, while the sound felt far more wounded and piano-based than previous iterations. With last year's swaggering GNX album, however, Lamar seems to be most preoccupied with having fun, using the project as a victory lap for gutter Los Angeles rap and its ability to \"squabble up\" to invaders. Although it wasn't featured on the project, the aforementioned five-Grammy-winning Drake diss Not Like Us definitely set the sharp-tongued tone that GNX possesses.\u00a0\n\"Artists of Kendrick's stature don't usually rock the boat [and change their sound too radically] once they become famous,\" says Moore. \"But he's done so with many of his releases, no matter how popular the previous albums were. He's encouraged others to take creative risks for their music. I think, more than anything, this courage has helped change popular music.\"\nMoore also credits Lamar's ability to turn big performances into public statements that dominate social media conversation for cultivating such a crossover popularity. For the 2016 Grammys, for example, Lamar's performance evoked the chains of slavery and America's prison-industrial complex, as the rapper tap-danced alongside prisoners. By hiring Lamar, then, the NFL are sure to make an enduring live statement, much as they did with Beyonc\u00e9's Hurricane Katrina-referencing Super Bowl performance from 2016. \"I would prepare for anything!\" predicts Moore. \"If there's any message that could emanate from Kendrick's Super Bowl performance in New Orleans, I think it could be about the wildfires in Los Angeles and the city's resilience.\"\nSeb Joseph, a marketing expert and editor at Digiday, believes the NFL's decision to have Lamar as a half-time performer is supposed to reflect the changing values of their brand and business itself, which has endured accusations of racism in the past. He says it doesn't matter if Lamar doesn't have a song with a catchy chorus embedded as deeply in the collective psyche as say Purple Rain or Crazy in Love, because his selection for the Super Bowl \"isn't a risk \u2013 it's a statement\".\u00a0\nJoseph adds: \"If previous Super Bowl performers like Prince, Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna embodied pop ubiquity, Kendrick represents something just as powerful: cultural gravity. His music isn't always designed for casual singalongs but rather it's built for reflection, resistance and resonance. And in a moment when the NFL is still navigating its own complicated relationship with race, protest and black artistic expression, Kendrick isn't just an artist\u00a0\u2013 they're inviting a movement to the main stage.\"\nLamar may help the NFL with its image problems, but the bigger question mark is around whether he will perform the Drake diss track. For many it's a song that reflected a changing of the guard in mainstream rap supremacy and solidified Lamar at the very top of the competitive ladder. Crowning it the best song of 2024, Pitchfork's Paul A Thompson wrote: \"In the third verse, Kendrick casts Drake as a parasite who leeches off of younger, more inventive rappers in a quest for pyrrhic streaming statements. But by that point he's already turned the biggest pop star on the planet into a punchline.\"\nThe Canadian artist has an ongoing legal action against his and Lamar's shared label Universal Music for releasing the song, but with Not Like Us now a five-time Grammy winner it's hard to imagine it not being performed. Could a half-time Super Bowl performance featuring the song represent a risk to all the lucrative advertisers? Not according to Digiday's Joseph.\n\"The song has transcended the beef. It's fun, it's infectious and it's already been embraced far beyond the hip-hop world. Instead of just a diss track, it's a cultural jolt \u2013 one that taps into regional pride, black joy and the communal energy that makes music feel alive. Brands love to co-opt hip-hop culture when it's convenient. They'll put rap lyrics on ad campaigns or with tweets; partner with artists for limited-edition sneakers' and drop hip-hop-inspired Super Bowl commercials\u00a0\u2013 all while keeping a safe distance from the actual violent tensions that shape the genre.\"\nWith or without Not Like Us making an appearance, Kendrick Lamar is risking a lot by even gracing that stage. \"The Super Bowl half-time show isn't just a performance \u2013 it's the single biggest branding opportunity in music. It's a 12-minute global ad for an artist's catalogue, cultural impact, and marketability, all broadcast to an audience of over 100 million people,\" says Joseph.\u00a0\n\"And here's the kicker: performers don't get paid! Instead, the exposure itself becomes the currency, often translating into massive streaming hikes, album sales and brand deals. Take Rihanna in 2023: her streams rose 640% after her performance, and Fenty Beauty reportedly pulled in more than $5 million in media impact value from that subtle but game-changing mid-show makeup touch up. But with the rewards come massive risks.\"\nJoseph continues: \"The Super Bowl is a high-stakes, zero-margin-for-error stage where the scrutiny is relentless, the expectations sky-high. If an artist miscalculates, whether it's the energy, the production or the cultural moment they're stepping into, the fallout can be brutal.\"\nMoore admits some of Lamar's day one fans might see a contradiction in an artist who has a hit single, Swimming Pools, criticising hip-hop alcoholism also performing at a show where alcohol brands pay millions for advertising slots. His advice? Embrace Lamar for who he is now, not in the past. \"Sure, some of his core fans might see his Super Bowl performance as a sell-out move, but I would encourage those listeners to go back and revisit his 2022 album, Mr Morale & The Big Steppers, where he shot back against the notion of being a paragon of virtue,\" Moore says.\n\"Though listeners may want him to be the same artist and person he was on albums like good kid, m.A.A.d. city and To Pimp a Butterfly, they have to realise that was a decade ago, and if they want that guy, they have to play those albums.\"\u00a0\nWhatever the fallout from Sunday's performance might be, it will at the very least represent something special for the people of Compton, with a good kid from a \"mad city\" rubber-stamping his musical legacy. Joseph just hopes to see Lamar perform Alright, believing the protest song's simple message of perseverance is needed now more than ever before.\nJoseph concludes: \"At a time when history feels like it is repeating itself, when the same battles for justice and dignity are being fought yet again, Kendrick standing on that stage, leading millions in the chorus of \"We gon' be alright,\" would be a powerful message. It would say: 'we're still here\u2026 and we're not going anywhere.'\"\u00a0\nThe Super Bowl LIX takes place on Sunday 9 February.\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.\nIn 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn\u2019t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like Jos\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico \u2013 New Spain \u2013 were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.\u00a0 \n \n - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder\n \n -\u00a0The world\u2019s most mysterious silver cups\n-\u00a0How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence\nThe ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi \u2013 the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years \u2013 is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.\nArchaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account.\nArchaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The a\u00f1il plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn\u2019t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue\u2019s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the a\u00f1il plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered.\nRhapsody in blue\nMaster painters from the Americas are discussed in art history \u2013 if they\u2019re mentioned at all \u2013 as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Ju\u00e1rez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico\u2019s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Ju\u00e1rez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale \u2013 and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Ju\u00e1rez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens\u2019, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue \u2013 if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Ju\u00e1rez died in poverty.\u00a0 If Ju\u00e1rez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe?\nOn the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' \u2018fear of space\u2019 \u2013 the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident \u2013 thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result \u2013 the same as his peers in Mexico \u2013 was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.\nBaltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as \u2018El Echave de los azules\u2019 (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home.\nThe lack of written evidence of the use of a\u00f1il or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren\u2019t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from a\u00f1il by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries.\nThis cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

The rare blue the Maya invented17 August 2018Devon Van Houten MaldonadoFeatures correspondentMuseo Nacional de Arte de MexicoThe colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.In 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.Getty ImagesThe 1,600-year-old murals at the Mayan temple at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 still have vibrant colours, including blue, which usually fades (Credit: Getty Images)Archaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD).",

        "article_text": "The world's only museum dedicated to the history and culture of the Gulf of Mexico may be in hot water following Trump's decision to change the name of the planet's largest gulf.\nLast year Karen Poth decided it was time to rename the museum she runs in Mobile, Alabama, to better reflect its unique status.\nTo do so, she first had to line up support from elected officials and her board of directors before raising money for the project. Next, she needed to update the museum's website, logo and printed materials. Then in April 2024, she finally unveiled the new name in letters stretching 50ft across the eight-storey building: the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, the only museum in the world dedicated to the history, folklore and culture of the largest gulf on Earth.\nSo, imagine her response when US President Donald Trump recently announced that he planned to rename the body of water to the south of the US from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. \"My personality is to laugh,\" Poth said. \"Or else you cry.\"\nThe name change, which was signed into law on 20 January and is part of a broader Trump effort to \"honour American greatness\", has created an international firestorm. After Google recently announced that it would follow Trump's executive order and also change the Gulf's name on Google Maps in the US, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argued that Trump alone cannot legally do that.\nPoth says she's not taking sides, but admits she's overwhelmed at the thought of what would happen if the museum had to change every reference to the Gulf of America. \"It would be a complete redo of the entire museum. If you think about it, every audio, every video, every digital, every sign\u2026 that will be very, very expensive.\"\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nSince the museum is owned by the city of Mobile, Poth said she will ultimately follow city officials' leads. \"If I need to change the name of the museum, we'll be up there changing the signage on the top of the building.\" The museum still carries debt from its opening a decade ago, and Poth estimates that changing the museum's name in 2024 cost nearly $100,000.\nBut as visitors to the museum learn, the Gulf has actually had many names throughout its multi-cultural history. The name Gulf of Mexico, for example, first appeared on Spanish maps in the mid-1500s as a way of honouring the Mexica people who founded the Aztec empire. Yet, the 218,000-sq-mile oceanic basin \u2013 which borders five US states and a longer stretch of shoreline along the eastern coast of Mexico, along with the north-west coast of Cuba \u2013 has had other names too.\nAccording to John Sledge, the museum's maritime historian in residence, when the Spanish first reached the Gulf in 1513, they thought they had found a route to Asia and initially called it the Chinese Sea (a name unlikely to appeal to Trump, Sledge noted). Other early explorers called it the Gulf of Cort\u00e9s or the Gulf of New Spain.\n\"It was really a Spanish sea throughout the 1500s and the 1600s,\" Sledge said. The Spanish were followed by the French, who founded Mobile and New Orleans in the early 1700s. The British gained control of the eastern edge of the region in the 1760s, before the United States finally seized the area in the 1810s.\nThe massive ship-shaped museum, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, is set on a commanding waterfront location in downtown Mobile's Cooper Riverside Park, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mobile's port and bay, which feeds directly into the Gulf. Interactive displays highlight the area's multi-layered history, as well as its global influence. Visitors learn how the first European settlement in the US wasn't in St Augustine, Florida, as is commonly thought, but some 450 miles west on the Gulf in Pensacola. Exhibits also show how the Gulf's waters have become one of the world's most productive fisheries and one of the US's largest oil-producing regions. In addition, the Gulf Stream, which originates here, influences transatlantic shipping routes and moderates the weather in Western Europe by bringing warm tropical waters north.\nOther popular exhibits include a simulator that lets guests practice piloting ships, models of famous shipwrecks, a multi-storey screen tracking European voyages and towers of shipping containers, which hold exhibits. The city of Mobile, museum curators like to say, changed the world when a local company helped launch the first containerised ships in the 1950s.\nMost people have no idea about the region's complex history, says Jack E Davis, whose 2017 book, The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea, won a Pulitzer Prize. \"They associate it with oil spills and hurricanes.\"\nIn recent weeks, Davis says friends have teased him that his 592-page book might have inspired Trump's executive order to rename the body of water. But Davis says he's not happy with the US's official new name for the Gulf, and when he saw the phrase \"Gulf of America\" used last month in an official pronouncement from Florida's governor, he had a physical response. \"I almost puked, it was just awful. It's so wrong.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only town in the US built for Chinese people\n\u2022 The first free Black town in the US\n\u2022 The first king to travel around the world\nGiven that the Gulf has been central to many cultures over the centuries, Davis claims the new name is just too confining. \"It's not just us,\" he said. \"[The name Gulf of Mexico] takes my mind beyond what we call America, beyond the US to other people to other places.\"\nDavis, who grew up along the Gulf Coast, urges travellers to get to know its museums, historic homes and natural scenery. One of his favourite spots is Padre Island National Seashore in Texas. \"If you go to Padre Island and you don't feel emotionally moved, check your pulse, because it's just really this otherworldly place.\"\nAccording to Davis, the Gulf's first residents arrived 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Early European visitors were astonished when they encountered the Calusa people who thrived along what is now south-west Florida. The tribe harvested the Gulf's abundant seafood, and piled up mounds of oyster shells that stretched for miles. Tribe members were so well-nourished they towered over the Europeans.\nThe next several hundred years saw Spain, France and England competing for influence, said Deanne Stephens,a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi and executive director of the Gulf South Historical Association. \"It was quite an amalgamation of players in the region.\"\u00a0\nSince the 19th Century, the Gulf has attracted immigrants from around the world, ranging from fruit-selling Sicilians in New Orleans to Greek sponge divers in Florida. Along Stephens' Mississippi coast, the seafood industry has attracted workers from places as varied as Poland, Croatia, Vietnam and now Latin America. \"Regardless of who was here, it was always recognised by people as a place of opportunity,\" she said.\u00a0\nLikewise, Poth says her museum consistently surprises visitors. \"They had no idea how important the Gulf of Mexico is to the world.\"\nShe's excited about plans for a new exhibit devoted to another Gulf global influencer: the late singer and Mobile city native Jimmy Buffett, whose hits like Margaritaville introduced many around the world to the coast's laid-back lifestyle. Yet, she admits that the project may bring up a host of issues. \"What are we going to call it? Every one of his songs is about the Gulf of Mexico.\"\nSledge, meanwhile, says if Trump wants to change the Gulf's name, a better choice might be to call it the Gulf of the Americas, which would acknowledge its geographic breadth and its enormous challenges. Scientists say the zone faces many threats in the coming century from pollution, coastal erosion and climate change.\n\"It's a shared resource,\" he said. \"We all depend on it, and it's in our interest to take care of it \u2013 whatever we call it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "He's an expert on all of NOLA's iconic foods but has a special place in his heart for gumbo. Here are his favourite bowls \u2013 from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine \u2013 unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\u00a0\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of\u00a0Acadian\u00a0descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\u00a0\nThe SpeciaList\nEmeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a\u00a0YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of\u00a0opinions on the\u00a0right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game \u2013 or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra \u2013 a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse \u2013 famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live \u00a0\u2013 has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo \u2013 served over rice \u2013 Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant, Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit\u00a0since\u00a0the space first opened in 1990. \"It used to be made with seafood,\" he says, \"then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.\"\nIt's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the\u00a0presentation\u00a0has too. \"The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,\" he says, \"that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux.\" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.\nHere are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.\nCommander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.\nPo'boys\nPo'boys (sometimes also written \"poor boy\") are one of NOLA's classic sandwiches \u2013 meats or seafood stuffed into crisp, light French bread. Lagasse's favourite? The po'boys at Domilise's. Inside the little yellow house on Annunciation Street, customers can choose from a whole menu of classic po'boys,\u00a0but Lagasse's top picks are fried shrimp, fried oysters or roast beef. \"You need about 20 napkins to eat the roast beef po-boy. It's soaked in gravy on NOLA-style French bread,\" he says. \"People debate whether to get it dressed\u00a0or not. I go for the dressed\u00a0po'boy, with\u00a0lettuce, tomato and pickles.\"\nIn the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct\u00a0blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of \"haute Creole cuisine\", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo.\u00a0\nEven though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. \"Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,\" he says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.commanderspalace.com/\nAddress: 1403 Washington Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: +1 504-899-8221\nInstagram: @commanderspalace\nCaf\u00e9 Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.\nLagasse's Insider Tips\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde\u00a0in the French Quarter is iconic but crawling with tourists; locals get their hot sugar-dusted beignets at Caf\u00e9\u00a0du Monde's other location on\u00a0Dreyfous Drive\u00a0instead.\u00a0\nAnd for Lagasse, NOLA's best fried chicken comes from\u00a0Popeye's Chicken, the international fast food chain, founded in New Orleans in 1972. \"I don't know why, it's the same formula. But I think NOLA has the best Popeye's fried chicken, no matter which one you go to.\"\u00a0\nWhile most of the hundreds of interns who have been through the 14-week programme go on to work in restaurants, others become nurses, mechanics, technicians and more. What's consistent is that they all learn to cook classic New Orleans fare like red beans and rice, po'boys and gumbo. \"Caf\u00e9 Reconcile's chicken and sausage gumbo has a rich roux with lots of okra,\" says Lagasse, \"and it always hits the spot.\" It's a win-win, according to Lagasse. \"Your meal helps support the workforce development,\" he says. \"What could be better?\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://cafereconcile.org/\nAddress: 1631 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70113\nPhone: +1 504-568-1157\nInstagram:\u00a0@cafereconcile\nKnown as the Queen of Creole cuisine, chef Leah Chase was the heart behind legendary Dooky Chase Restaurant, first opened\u00a0in 1941 by\u00a0her in-laws and later evolving into a meeting place for excellent food, music and dialogue.\nJambalaya\nWhen Lagasse craves jambalaya \u2013 a rice dish cooked with a variety of proteins \u2013 he goes to one of two places for what he defines as the best: \"one that's not too dry and not too wet.\" The first is Toups' Meatery where the jambalaya is prepared with chicken and smoky andouille sausage. He also likes the jambalaya at Dooky Chase, which includes three kinds of pork, such as smoked ham, smoked chorizo and sausage. \"In the city of New Orleans, jambalaya is primarily made in a Creole style, so you'll often find tomato in it, but out in the country there's no tomato\".\nIn the upstairs dining room, many influential leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr and the Reverend\u00a0A L Davis, met to discuss crucial issues affecting the African American community.\nStarting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday),\u00a0Chase would\u00a0cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens.\u00a0\"They do a traditional style of gumbo,\" explains Lagasse, \"but during Lent it has lots of greens \u2013 mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens\u00a0and okra, and it's finished with gumbo fil\u00e9.\"\u00a0\u00a0For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted\u00a0New Orleanians from all over the city.\u00a0Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar \"Dook\" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition. Some say it is the best in New\u00a0Orleans.\nWebsite: https://www.dookychaserestaurants.com/\nAddress: 2301 Orleans Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119\nPhone: +1 504-821-0600\nInstagram: @dookychaserestaurant\nFamily-owned since 1919, Casamento's on Magazine Street is primarily known for its briny Gulf Coast oysters, which peak during cool autumn and winter months. \"Locals love to go there whenever they see the open sign, which is only when the oysters are great,\" says Lagasse. He enjoys eating the plump oysters alongside their much-loved seafood gumbo, which is replete with shrimp, tomatoes and okra. Other Casamento's must-haves include their oyster stew and sandwiches, made with their signature \"pan bread\" instead of traditional French bread.\nWebsite: https://casamentosrestaurant.com/\nAddress: 4330 Magazine Street, New Orleans, LA 70115\nPhone: +1 504-895-9761\nInstagram: @casamentosrestaurant\nChef Frank Brigtsen also started his culinary career as an apprentice under Paul Prudhomme, who helped him and his wife Marna open\u00a0Brigtsen's\u00a0in 1986 in NOLA's Riverbend\u00a0neighbourhood, where he serves classic\u00a0Cajun-Creole cuisine.\u00a0\n\"Frank is an excellent cook,\" says Lagasse, \"and I really like his fil\u00e9 gumbo, which is Cajun-style, meaning it has no tomatoes.\" Cajun gumbo also doesn't include okra. Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with fil\u00e9 powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. \"The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,\" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour. This cuts the cooking time significantly and yields a deep, complex flavour.\u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://brigtsens.com/\nAddress: 723 Dante Street, New Orleans, LA 70118\nPhone: +1 504-861-7610\nInstagram:\u00a0@frankbrigtsen\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "League One side Leyton Orient are hoping to cause one of the biggest shocks in the FA Cup's illustrious history when they host defending Premier League champions Manchester City on Saturday.\nYou can watch the tie live on BBC One and also listen to Chris Sutton's co-commentary from Gaughan Group Stadium on BBC Radio 5 Live - but is our predictions expert expecting an upset?\n\"City boss Pep Guardiola always takes the FA Cup seriously,\" Sutton said. \"He will have to this season, because it is the best chance they have got of winning a trophy.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all 16 fourth-round ties and given his verdict on who will make it into round five.\nFor this week's matches he is up against two guests who definitely don't want to see an Orient win make the headlines - Jez and Andy Williams from indie band Doves, who are both City fans.\nDoves' new album, Constellations For the Lonely, is released on 28 February. Their latest single, Cold Dreaming, is out now and they tour the UK in February and March.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nConstellations For the Lonely is Doves' sixth studio album. The band's first two albums, Lost Souls and The Last Broadcast, were nominated for the Mercury Prize, while their third, Some Cities, and fourth, Kingdom of Rust, debuted at numbers one and two in the UK charts respectively\nDrummer Andy and guitarist Jez are both lifelong City fans - or, almost lifelong in the case of Jez - who admits he very briefly supported Manchester United.\n\"Andy went for City and, because we were twins, I went for the opposite because I wanted to be my own person,\" Jez told BBC Sport.\n\"It was when we were six or seven and I was like well, I am having Red if he is Blue! So, I went Red, but then I saw the light and switched to the correct side pretty quickly.\"\nTheir first heroes were City legends Colin Bell and Mike Summerbee - who Andy once impressed with his penalty-taking prowess.\n\"Bell and Summerbee were a bit before our time as players, but they were still such big figures in Manchester,\" Andy explained.\n\"We went to Mike Summerbee's Soccer School once, and I won a penalty contest - it is the only football trophy I have ever won, and I have still got it in my studio, this plastic thing.\n\"Summerbee went in goal and I had this technique where I would zig-zag with my run-up and then just boot it. I think everyone was laughing at me so much that he just let them in.\n\"I thought I was being really clever, but I probably looked a bit of a plonker!\"\nJez was briefly a Red, but Andy has always been a Blue.\nThe current City squad is full of superstars but, even during the club's less successful period in the 1990s, there were still players that got Andy and Jez off their seats.\n\"We went to watch them a lot then, to Maine Road, and I think our next hero was Georgi Kinkladze,\" Andy said. \n\"And Paul Dickov and The Goat [Shaun Goater],\" added Jez. \"They were all brilliant.\n\"Obviously they were around in what I would call the dark days, but they were inspirational weren't they? When they shone, they really shone. Especially Kinkladze and his runs like the goals he scored against Leicester and West Ham in the FA Cup.\"\nYou can watch Kinkladze's solo goal against the Hammers  from 1998 below. His goal in a replay against Leicester in 1996 saw him pick up the ball in his own half and accelerate past three players before firing into the bottom corner.\n\"I was there,\" Andy said. \"They were such difficult days for City but when Kinkladze or Uwe Rosler did something special like that, the whole place would light up. We needed players like that to give us those moments. \n\"There have been a few like them down the years - not just great players, but also City though and through.\"\nChris Sutton, Jez Williams and Andy Williams were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThis video can not be played\nArchive: Kinkladze scores 'magnificent' FA Cup goal for Man City\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nManchester United 2-1 Leicester City\nWhat a story it is to see Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has won the FA Cup with Manchester United as a player, going back to Old Trafford with Leicester.\nHe was in charge of United when they beat the Foxes there twice in the space of two weeks earlier in the season, but he will want a different outcome this time.\nLeicester are struggling at the moment but this still won't be straightforward for United. \nIt's amazing how many surprise results there have been in the Premier League this season, but the one constant has been that United have been awful throughout.\nI have absolutely no confidence in this prediction but, based on how poor Leicester have been recently, and also their heavy defeat by Everton last time out, I think the holders will find a way of winning this tie in 90 minutes to make it into the draw for round five.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJez: So, we can choose what we want to happen as well as what we think might happen? Good! Leicester to beat United, then - even if Leicester are having a terrible time at the moment.\nAndy: United are not having a good time either!\nDoves' prediction: 1-2\nLeeds 0-2 Millwall\nThis is an awkward one to call because of Leeds' situation. \nThey are five points clear at the top of the Championship after beating Coventry on Wednesday but four teams are going for the two automatic spots. Promotion is their priority, and I think their manager Daniel Farke will make quite a few changes here.\nI don't agree with that thinking, but I can kind of understand it. I'd love to see Leeds really have a go in the FA Cup but they play Watford in the Championship next Tuesday. Their schedule is relentless, and the financial rewards of going up - or the consequences of missing out - are huge.\nFarke is not the only former Norwich boss involved here - Alex Neil is a pretty shrewd manager who is on a good little run with Millwall and they have just won three games in a row to put themselves on the fringe of the play-off race.\nI had to think quite a lot about this one, but I am going to go with Millwall to cause an upset.\nThey have already beaten Leeds this season, at The Den in November, and Leeds have only lost one of their 18 games since.\nBut this prediction is based more on the kind of team I am expecting Leeds will put out, because I think Farke is more likely to put out a weakened team than Neil.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\nDoves' prediction: 1-2\nLeyton Orient 1-2 Manchester City\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola will probably make some changes with his side's Champions League tie against Real Madrid coming up on Tuesday, but he won't just field a load of kids.\nInstead it will probably be Kevin de Bruyne and Jack Grealish who come into the side, so City are hardly going to be lacking experience.\nLeyton Orient have already been one of the stories of this season's FA Cup, thanks to  goalkeeper Josh Keeley, who went up for a stoppage-time corner in their second-round win over Oldham and scored a 99th-minute equaliser to force extra time, then Dan Agyei got their winner in the 121st minute.\nOrient went on to knock out Championship side Derby County on penalties in round three to earn this tie, but I feel a bit sorry for them because they won't be at full strength here.\nThey had a good January in terms of making signings but lots of the new players won't be eligible here, and they have some injuries to contend with too.\nSaturday's loss at home to Stockport was their first defeat in 13 games and while they have been in excellent form, they have lost a bit of momentum.\nTheir manager Richie Wellens is a boyhood Manchester United fan who started his career with the Reds and would love to get one over City, but I don't see it happening for him.\nCity won't get as many as they did against Salford City in round three, but they are going through. Orient will get a goal, but that's all.\nSutton's prediction: 1-3\nThis video can not be played\nMan City put eight past Salford to progress to fourth round\nJez: We just did not realise how much of an influence Rodri was on the rest of the players until he got injured in September. His presence must have a psychological, calming, effect because everyone looked better and more confident when he was in the team. It's only in the past few weeks that we have started to look ourselves, apart from last weekend of course, when we got absolutely trounced. I think everyone is enjoying our wobble.\nAndy: Rodri is one of the best midfielders in the world, that's why we've missed him.\nJez: My personal ambition for the season now is I want to finish in the top four and as long as we make that, I'd be happy. The Champions League you can forget - obviously I want us to win it, but you've got to be realistic. An FA Cup win would be nice, and that is definitely doable.\nAndy: Of course we can win it. We've got to beat Orient first, but that's what we've gone for. Pep always shows every team massive respect, and that's why complacency never comes into it for us in games like this. He will field a strong side.\nJez: The beauty of the FA Cup is seeing the shocks. We'd all like it if United or Liverpool lost to a smaller club, but you just don't want the upset to be you!\nDoves' prediction: 0-4\nCoventry 1-4 Ipswich\nIpswich are on a terrible run in the Premier League, with their worst result coming with their home defeat by Southampton on Saturday.\nCoventry have been doing much better under Frank Lampard in the Championship, winning four games in a row before they lost to leaders Leeds on Wednesday.\nOn the face of it, this looks like a possible upset, especially if Ipswich rest players, but I actually think they will go strong.\nThe Tractor Boys are a team who need a result to kick on after losing their past four matches.\nKieran McKenna's side are have got games coming up against Aston Villa, Tottenham and Manchester United and they need to win a game first to give themselves some confidence and try to find some rhythm again.\nSutton's prediction: 0-1\nDoves' prediction: 2-1\nEverton 0-2 Bournemouth\nI went with Bournemouth to beat Liverpool last weekend, and they gave it a really good go. The Cherries hit the woodwork twice and they were unlucky to lose in the end.\nI can see Everton making a few changes here, because they play Liverpool in the rearranged Merseyside derby on Wednesday.\nAfter three straight wins, Everton manager David Moyes will still want a good performance to keep the momentum going, but I am going to stick with my policy of backing Bournemouth.\nThe Cherries have already beaten Everton twice this season - firstly with that incredible finish to their game in August, when they came back from being 2-0 down after 87 minutes to win 3-2, and then at the start of January when they won 1-0 in Sean Dyche's last game as Toffees boss.\nI would love Andoni Iraola to go strong in the FA Cup this season and go all out to win it - the possibility is there, even with their current injury problems.\nOn that basis, I am going for them to get the better of Everton again, and make it a hat-trick of wins over them.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nDoves' prediction: 2-1\nPreston 0-0 Wycombe (4-2 pens)\nI watched Preston lose against my old club Blackburn last week, and I was quite disappointed by what I saw.\nBasically they went 2-0 down and only then did they start to play, and have a go.\nTrue, there was a decision at the end where I can understand why Preston boss Paul Heckingbottom felt harshly done by to not get a penalty, because of the one Blackburn had been awarded earlier.\nSo, I get why he was frustrated with the referee, but he must have been frustrated with his players as well because they had been on such a good run, and still have the possibility of the play-offs.\nThis won't be easy for Preston, because Wycombe are flying at the top of League One and have the best away record in their division, but I still think home advantage will count for a lot.\nI'm told Wycombe are also the top scorers in League One, and that in fact only Liverpool and Leeds have scored more league goals than them in England's top four divisions this season, but my gut feeling was Preston will win this 1-0, and I am sticking with it.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nDoves' prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Wycombe to win 16-15 on penalties\nSouthampton 0-1 Burnley\nBurnley's defensive record is unbelievable, but they have got a problem at the other end of the pitch. \nThey don't score many goals and it appears there is an element of Burnley fans who are quite bored watching Scott Parker's team.\nTheir situation is the same as Leeds, in that they are one of four teams chasing one of the two automatic promotion spots in the Championship.\nAgain, they have got a midweek league game coming up, at Hull City on Wednesday, which will be their priority. I think Parker will make changes here and they will fall foul of that.\nSouthampton will not be complaining, because they have won so few games against anyone this season.\nSaints picked up a rare win at Ipswich last weekend, and at home they have managed only three victories in all competitions - Stoke in the Carabao Cup, Everton in the league and Swansea in the FA Cup third round.\nTo say they have momentum after beating Ipswich is probably pushing it, and they are still a long way adrift at the bottom of the table, but a decent FA Cup run would give their fans a bit of escapism in what has been a miserable season.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nDoves' prediction: 2-1\nStoke 3-3 Cardiff (2-4 pens)\nI really wish I could have been on Final Score last Saturday alongside my friend Jason Mohammad, who had a day to forget.\nJason posted on X at the start of the show that there would be live updates from Leeds against his team - Cardiff - who ended up losing 7-0.\nCardiff had been on a decent run of form until that defeat but I am afraid I have got more bad news for Jason because I think his side are going out of the FA Cup on Saturday.\nStoke have turned the corner of late too, under my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, although both sides are only a few points above the Championship relegation zone.\nRobins had an amazing run to the FA Cup semi-finals - and almost the final - with Coventry last season, of course, but the scoreline I am going with is more a case of me wanting to rub Jason's nose in it, rather than based on science the way my predictions usually are.\nSutton's prediction: 4-0\nDoves' prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Cardiff to win 2-1 on penalties\nWigan 1-2 Fulham\nWigan boss Shaun Maloney says he learned a lot about management from Fulham boss Marco Silva when he played under him at Hull City, but I am surprised he has not said the same about me.\nShaun had an outstanding playing career, and he has a lot to thank me for about that - I helped him a lot when he was a youngster at Celtic, both technically and psychologically.\nBeing serious, fair play to him for the job he has done at Wigan because he has had a lot to contend with there. He also had a tough time in charge of Hibs, where he was wrongly sacked and was not given long enough.\nSo, I have a lot of admiration for what Shaun has done as a manager and Wigan are doing all right under him, but this is a tough game for them.\nFulham are like Bournemouth in that they are in the top half of the Premier League and I want to see them give the FA Cup a real go.\nWe talked about Silva's side on the Monday Night Club this week actually, as having a brilliant bench that can make a contribution most weeks.\nAt the start of the season I thought Fulham's home form was impressive but it has dropped off recently, and it is their away form that is exceptional at the moment.\nI think they will carry that on in the FA Cup, and they will be too strong for Wigan.\nThis game could see twin brothers Ryan and Steven Sessegnon play against each other for the first time in their careers - Ryan for Fulham and Steven for Wigan.\nI played against my younger brother, John, when we were both up in Scotland and he tried to kick me but did not get near me - it was a bit like when we played each other in the garden when we were kids, although I was 10 years older than him.\nSutton's prediction: 1-3\nDoves' prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Fulham to win 2-1 on penalties\nBirmingham 2-3 Newcastle\nThere were raucous scenes at St James' Park on Wednesday night after Newcastle had beaten Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-finals.\nWhat a brilliant result over two legs against the Gunners, and why wouldn't Magpies fans want more of the same in the FA Cup as well?\nThey want to end their long wait for a trophy and they will head for St Andrew's on a high.\nI do wonder if Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will rest one or two of his key men, because his side are going for a top four finish in the Premier League too.\nBut if I were him I would not be resting anyone against a Birmingham side who are in fantastic form at the top of League One.\nI am a big fan of Birmingham boss Chris Davies, who spent time working with Brendan Rogers at a few clubs, including Celtic, but has stepped up as a manager himself. I always admire people who do that.\nDavies has signed a few players from north of the border for the Blues, and also spent more than \u00a310m on Jay Stansfield from Fulham in August.\nThat is a bit of clout for a League One club to have, but Birmingham wanted to go straight back up after being relegated last season, and it looks like it will pay off.\nThis is a shot to nothing for them against Newcastle, and I think they will give them a good game - but I am going with Newcastle to come out on top.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nDoves' prediction: 1-3\nBrighton 2-1 Chelsea\nThis is not an easy tie to call.\nBrighton need to bounce back from losing 7-0 to Nottingham Forest, while Chelsea have been very up and down in recent weeks.\nSeagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler is quite an interesting character to watch on the touchline because of how emotional he is during the game. \nHe has had five yellow cards and a red already this season and he has got to be careful, because that kind of indiscipline can rub off on your players.\nI think this game will be tight - I certainly don't see Brighton capitulating the way they did at Forest, but the key thing for them is Yasin Ayari and Carlos Baleba being fit to return in midfield.\nEven if they both return, I still feel like Chelsea will find a way of winning the tie. It may go all the way to penalties but I am going to say Enzo Maresca's side will win it in extra time.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\nDoves' prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Brighton to win 5-4 on penalties\nBlackburn Rovers 0-2 Wolves\nI am co-commentating at this game for the iPlayer, and I am really looking forward to going back to Ewood Park.\nPeople there always tell me the great Alan Shearer was lucky to play alongside me when we won the Premier League together, and I know Al says the same himself regularly too.\nThis is one of the ties where you think there is a chance of an upset, because of what Wolves boss Vitor Pereira might do - does he go full pelt, or rest a few?\nPereira will make some changes, I am sure of that, because staying in the Premier League will be his priority.\nRovers manager John Eustace has a different dilemma because I bet he would love to shuffle his squad to help their play-off bid, but he does not have the players to do it.\nEustace has done a phenomenal job to have them in and around the top six, despite not being given any help in terms of signings.\nScoring goals is Rovers' problem - Yuki Ohashi is out injured and Makhtar Gueye is not very prolific - and Andreas Weimann is their top scorer this season with eight.\nThey are solid enough, though, with the likes of Callum Brittain, who has probably been Blackburn's best player this season, alongside Dom Hyam and Danny Batth at the back. They have all been colossal. \nGetting Lewis Travis back from injury has been important too. He is their real driving force in the middle of the park.\nAs I say, I am not sure what the Wolves team selection will be like, but Pereira might want to build on last weekend's win over Aston Villa.\nBased on that, and the fact Blackburn play some good stuff but are not ruthless enough, this is another tie which could go the distance.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\nDoves' prediction: 1-0\nPlymouth 1-0 Liverpool\nPlymouth got their first league win since the start of November when they beat West Brom on Saturday, and they have brought a couple of players in under their new manager, Miron Muslic.\nEven so, you cannot see past Liverpool's quality getting them a win here.\nArne Slot's side are going strong in Europe as well as the Premier League and I suppose the question is whether the number of games they play takes its toll eventually.\nSo far, though, Slot has managed their schedule so well, and their squad is very strong. For example, Trent Alexander-Arnold is out at the moment, but Conor Bradley can come in at right-back - problem solved.\nI am speaking before they play Tottenham in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, but even defeat there would not derail their season. They have dropped points here and there, but unlike every other team at the top of the Premier League, they have not had a dodgy period.\nWhatever team that Slot puts out here, my feeling is that Liverpool are pretty unstoppable. They have this relentless nature, and they will find a way of beating Plymouth.\nSutton's prediction: 1-3\nDoves' prediction: 1-4\nAston Villa 2-1 Tottenham\nThursday's Carabao Cup semi-final is enormous for Tottenham's season.\nIf they win, the pressure is not off their manager Ange Postecoglou but they would be into a major final and he would be one step away from their first major trophy since 2008 - their fans will be thinking very differently.\nIf they lose, the pressure going into this tie would be heightened.\nThe way Spurs beat Brentford was more 'Ange-Wall' than 'Ange-Ball' but it worked, and they might need more of the same to get through here.\nIt will help Aston Villa that they don't have a midweek game before this tie and, as well as the result against Liverpool, one of the things that will affect Tottenham is fatigue and how many players they have got fit.\nWhen these two teams met in November, Spurs won 4-1 but it was a strange game and it could actually have gone either way. The same applies here too.\nLike Tottenham, Villa also have a problem keeping clean sheets - they have managed only one in their past 13 games - so I think there will be goals in this tie.\nIt will be interesting to see if Villa's new loan signing, Marcus Rashford, gets one of them. \nBringing Rashford in is a gamble, but I know myself from my career how a change of scenery can reinvigorate a player. This is essentially a trial for him - if he does well, they will sign him. If not, he will be going back to Manchester United.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Villa to win 12-11 on penalties\nDoves' prediction: 2-1\nEco-Power Stadium, 20:00 GMT\n2nd in League Two v 12th in Premier League\nGap = 58\nWatch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nDoncaster are the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup but they won't be left in after they have played Crystal Palace.\nPalace have really improved in the past couple of months and, after a slow start to the season, they are now safe from relegation.\nI'd love to see the Eagles give it a go in the FA Cup this season. With Jean-Philippe Mateta up front they are a threat to anyone, and they will have too much for Doncaster to deal with.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nDoves' prediction: 1-3\nSt James Park, 20:00 GMT\n17th in League One v 3rd in Premier League\nGap = 58\nI know it is being televised but I don't really understand why this game has to be on a Tuesday night, and I don't like it.\nThe timing might affect Nuno Espirito Santo's team selection before Nottingham Forest go to Fulham on Saturday. It seems unfair they cannot play at the weekend like everyone else, and have a clear week before travelling to Craven Cottage.\nIt won't stop 'The Wood-Chopper' [Chris Wood] from sending Forest through, but it could mean Nuno makes more changes for this tie. I hope he doesn't, but I think he might - although they should still have too much for Exeter.\nThis is the first time that Exeter have reached the fourth round since 1980-81, and they went on to lose to eventual winners Tottenham in the quarter-finals.\nI'd love to see Forest - have I mentioned they were my boyhood team? - repeat that feat and go all the way to the final this season. If they do make it to Wembley, I will definitely be there cheering them on.\nSutton's prediction: 0-3\nDoves' prediction: 0-4\nChris and his guest, actor Billy Bob Thornton, both correctly picked the winner in 22 of the 32 FA Cup third-round ties.\nThe BBC readers did slightly better, and were right about 23 of the ties.\nNot many of you saw Plymouth's win at Brentford coming, however. Out of more than 38,000 predictions, only 4% of you went with Argyle to progress.\nChris got three correct results from the 10 Premier League games in week 24, with one exact score, giving him a total of 60 points.\nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, the BBC readers got five correct results but with no exact scores, giving them 50 points.\nThe winner was Chris's guest, Squid guitarist Anton Pearson. He got four correct results with one exact score, giving him a total of 70 points.",

        "summary": "Their schedule is relentless, and the financial rewards of going up - or the consequences of missing out - are huge.Farke is not the only former Norwich boss involved here - Alex Neil is a pretty shrewd manager who is on a good little run with Millwall and they have just won three games in a row to put themselves on the fringe of the play-off race.I had to think quite a lot about this one, but I am going to go with Millwall to cause an upset.They have already beaten Leeds this season, at The Den in November, and Leeds have only lost one of their 18 games since.But this prediction is based more on the kind of team I am expecting Leeds will put out, because I think Farke is more likely to put out a weakened team than Neil.Sutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra timeDoves' prediction: 1-2What information do we collect from this quiz?Leyton Orient 1-2 Manchester CityManchester City boss Pep Guardiola will probably make some changes with his side's Champions League tie against Real Madrid coming up on Tuesday, but he won't just field a load of kids.Instead it will probably be Kevin de Bruyne and Jack Grealish who come into the side, so City are hardly going to be lacking experience.Leyton Orient have already been one of the stories of this season's FA Cup, thanks to  goalkeeper Josh Keeley, who went up for a stoppage-time corner in their second-round win over Oldham and scored a 99th-minute equaliser to force extra time, then Dan Agyei got their winner in the 121st minute.Orient went on to knock out Championship side Derby County on penalties in round three to earn this tie, but I feel a bit sorry for them because they won't be at full strength here.They had a good January in terms of making signings but lots of the new players won't be eligible here, and they have some injuries to contend with too.Saturday's loss at home to Stockport was their first defeat in 13 games and while they have been in excellent form, they have lost a bit of momentum.Their manager Richie Wellens is a boyhood Manchester United fan who started his career with the Reds and would love to get one over City, but I don't see it happening for him.City won't get as many as they did against Salford City in round three, but they are going through. We'd all like it if United or Liverpool lost to a smaller club, but you just don't want the upset to be you!Doves' prediction: 0-4What information do we collect from this quiz?Coventry 1-4 IpswichIpswich are on a terrible run in the Premier League, with their worst result coming with their home defeat by Southampton on Saturday.Coventry have been doing much better under Frank Lampard in the Championship, winning four games in a row before they lost to leaders Leeds on Wednesday.On the face of it, this looks like a possible upset, especially if Ipswich rest players, but I actually think they will go strong.The Tractor Boys are a team who need a result to kick on after losing their past four matches.Kieran McKenna's side are have got games coming up against Aston Villa, Tottenham and Manchester United and they need to win a game first to give themselves some confidence and try to find some rhythm again.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Doves' prediction: 2-1What information do we collect from this quiz?Everton 0-2 BournemouthI went with Bournemouth to beat Liverpool last weekend, and they gave it a really good go. He also had a tough time in charge of Hibs, where he was wrongly sacked and was not given long enough.So, I have a lot of admiration for what Shaun has done as a manager and Wigan are doing all right under him, but this is a tough game for them.Fulham are like Bournemouth in that they are in the top half of the Premier League and I want to see them give the FA Cup a real go.We talked about Silva's side on the Monday Night Club this week actually, as having a brilliant bench that can make a contribution most weeks.At the start of the season I thought Fulham's home form was impressive but it has dropped off recently, and it is their away form that is exceptional at the moment.I think they will carry that on in the FA Cup, and they will be too strong for Wigan.This game could see twin brothers Ryan and Steven Sessegnon play against each other for the first time in their careers - Ryan for Fulham and Steven for Wigan.I played against my younger brother, John, when we were both up in Scotland and he tried to kick me but did not get near me - it was a bit like when we played each other in the garden when we were kids, although I was 10 years older than him.Sutton's prediction: 1-3Doves' prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Fulham to win 2-1 on penaltiesWhat information do we collect from this quiz?Birmingham 2-3 NewcastleThere were raucous scenes at St James' Park on Wednesday night after Newcastle had beaten Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-finals.What a brilliant result over two legs against the Gunners, and why wouldn't Magpies fans want more of the same in the FA Cup as well?They want to end their long wait for a trophy and they will head for St Andrew's on a high.I do wonder if Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will rest one or two of his key men, because his side are going for a top four finish in the Premier League too.But if I were him I would not be resting anyone against a Birmingham side who are in fantastic form at the top of League One.I am a big fan of Birmingham boss Chris Davies, who spent time working with Brendan Rogers at a few clubs, including Celtic, but has stepped up as a manager himself. I think Parker will make changes here and they will fall foul of that.Southampton will not be complaining, because they have won so few games against anyone this season.Saints picked up a rare win at Ipswich last weekend, and at home they have managed only three victories in all competitions - Stoke in the Carabao Cup, Everton in the league and Swansea in the FA Cup third round.To say they have momentum after beating Ipswich is probably pushing it, and they are still a long way adrift at the bottom of the table, but a decent FA Cup run would give their fans a bit of escapism in what has been a miserable season.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Doves' prediction: 2-1What information do we collect from this quiz?Stoke 3-3 Cardiff (2-4 pens)I really wish I could have been on Final Score last Saturday alongside my friend Jason Mohammad, who had a day to forget.Jason posted on X at the start of the show that there would be live updates from Leeds against his team - Cardiff - who ended up losing 7-0.Cardiff had been on a decent run of form until that defeat but I am afraid I have got more bad news for Jason because I think his side are going out of the FA Cup on Saturday.Stoke have turned the corner of late too, under my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, although both sides are only a few points above the Championship relegation zone.Robins had an amazing run to the FA Cup semi-finals - and almost the final - with Coventry last season, of course, but the scoreline I am going with is more a case of me wanting to rub Jason's nose in it, rather than based on science the way my predictions usually are.Sutton's prediction: 4-0Doves' prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Cardiff to win 2-1 on penaltiesWhat information do we collect from this quiz?Wigan 1-2 FulhamWigan boss Shaun Maloney says he learned a lot about management from Fulham boss Marco Silva when he played under him at Hull City, but I am surprised he has not said the same about me.Shaun had an outstanding playing career, and he has a lot to thank me for about that - I helped him a lot when he was a youngster at Celtic, both technically and psychologically.Being serious, fair play to him for the job he has done at Wigan because he has had a lot to contend with there. The Cherries hit the woodwork twice and they were unlucky to lose in the end.I can see Everton making a few changes here, because they play Liverpool in the rearranged Merseyside derby on Wednesday.After three straight wins, Everton manager David Moyes will still want a good performance to keep the momentum going, but I am going to stick with my policy of backing Bournemouth.The Cherries have already beaten Everton twice this season - firstly with that incredible finish to their game in August, when they came back from being 2-0 down after 87 minutes to win 3-2, and then at the start of January when they won 1-0 in Sean Dyche's last game as Toffees boss.I would love Andoni Iraola to go strong in the FA Cup this season and go all out to win it - the possibility is there, even with their current injury problems.On that basis, I am going for them to get the better of Everton again, and make it a hat-trick of wins over them.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Doves' prediction: 2-1What information do we collect from this quiz?Preston 0-0 Wycombe (4-2 pens)I watched Preston lose against my old club Blackburn last week, and I was quite disappointed by what I saw.Basically they went 2-0 down and only then did they start to play, and have a go.True, there was a decision at the end where I can understand why Preston boss Paul Heckingbottom felt harshly done by to not get a penalty, because of the one Blackburn had been awarded earlier.So, I get why he was frustrated with the referee, but he must have been frustrated with his players as well because they had been on such a good run, and still have the possibility of the play-offs.This won't be easy for Preston, because Wycombe are flying at the top of League One and have the best away record in their division, but I still think home advantage will count for a lot.I'm told Wycombe are also the top scorers in League One, and that in fact only Liverpool and Leeds have scored more league goals than them in England's top four divisions this season, but my gut feeling was Preston will win this 1-0, and I am sticking with it.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Doves' prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Wycombe to win 16-15 on penaltiesWhat information do we collect from this quiz?Southampton 0-1 BurnleyBurnley's defensive record is unbelievable, but they have got a problem at the other end of the pitch.",

        "article_text": "The actress has deep Hawaiian roots and loves sharing her culture via music, films and moments spent with family. Here are her favourite ways to find \"ohana\" in Hawaii.\nTwenty-three years after lending her voice to Lilo's big sister Nani in the Lilo & Stitch animated film, Tia Carrere is coming full-circle as she stars in the upcoming live-action Lilo & Stitch film as a new character, Mrs Kekoa, a no-nonsense social worker. But the role is also a chance for Carrere to do one of the things she loves most: showcase her Hawaiian heritage.\n\"I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii,\" Carrere tells the BBC from Maui's pristine Napili Bay, where she's joined longtime musical collaborator Daniel Ho to perform in George Kahumoku Jr.'s Hawaii Masters Tour. \"It informs everything about me.\"\nThe SpeciaList\nHonolulu-born actress and singer Tia Carrere is forever beloved as the \"babelicious\" rocker Cassandra in Wayne's World and the voice of Lilo's big sister Nani in the animated 2002 film Lilo & Stitch. She has won two Grammy Awards for her Hawaiian music albums with Hawaiian multi-instrumentalist Daniel Ho and will be appearing as Mrs Kekoa in the Lilo & Stitch live-action film in theatres starting May 2025.\nCarrere's Hollywood career famously began when she was discovered at a supermarket in Waikiki as a 17-year-old. \"I always say that people come to Hollywood from somewhere else to become something else,\" she muses. \"I think because I was born and raised in Hawaii, it's really grounded me. It's my grandma's homespun knowledge; the golden rule, very simple\u2026 and that's Hawaii. I love Hawaii.\"\nCarrere has lived in Los Angeles for decades but has never forgotten the concept or the feeling of ohana (family). \"Family to Hawaiians means a solid base that you can trust to have your back \u2013 always,\" says Carrere, who returns regularly to visit. \"\u2026 [And] Hawaii is a great place to vacation with your family, because the most delightful things about Hawaii don't have to cost you anything more than just flying here and staying here\u2026. Because you walk out your door and you're in the ocean. The kids can build sandcastles on the beach. They can collect flowers. They can go hiking through a bamboo forest. They can see birds that they've never seen anywhere before. They can snorkel and see fishes and coral that they've never seen before. Anywhere you go, it's absolutely delightful, and it's all just right there\u2026 It's the Earth.\"\nHere are Carrere's favourite ways to enjoy ohana in Hawaii.\n\"I love this place for families,\" says Carrere \u2013 mother to 19-year-old Bianca and auntie to several nieces and nephews. \"You get off the plane here [in Maui] and [a sign says], 'Maui has eight of the 10 most-dangerous beaches in Hawaii for spinal cord injury.' I guess it's the way the water sucks up and comes down. It's a wicked shore break. So it makes it very dangerous, particularly for kids. That's why I love Napili Bay. It's cove-like, it protects you.\"\nCarrere loves staying at Napili Kai Beach Resort in Napili Bay, an idyllic half-moon-shaped resort beach in West Maui that's refreshingly less-crowded than many of its sister beaches. Napili Kai Beach Resort's vintage gabled wooden structure is likewise a throwback to a simpler time.\nGot little kids?\nHead to Carrere's pick, Ala Moana Beach Park Magic Island in Waikiki.\"It's a very protected, super-chill beach for little, tiny kids,\" she says. \"It's a safe haven for them to just sit and play on the sand. You don't have to worry about current coming in.\"\n\"It reminds me of when I was a kid,\" says Carrere of the boutique resort; originally built in the 1960s. \"It's not luxe; it doesn't have elevators to get to the second floor with your luggage. But I like it. It's got refrigerators in the room, and whatever you need for kids, but it's mostly about the bay and how simple and charming it is. It's the best quaint time capsule of a hotel in Hawaii.\"\nNapili Kai offers spacious one-room suites with oceanfront, beach and garden views. Visitors can swim, snorkel or relax on the beach, and dine at the property's casual snack bar or award-winning Sea House restaurant. Best of all? The resort offers dining and activity programmes that are free for kids. \u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.napilikai.com/\nAddress: 5900 Lower Honoapiilani Rd, Lahaina, HI 96761, United States\nPhone: +18086696271\nInstagram: @napili_kai\nA geologist's paradise, Hawaii's eight main islands are home to 15 volcanoes; six of which are active. Seasoned adventurers can take volcano expeditions and hike past cavernous craters and eerie eruption sites, culminating in jaw-dropping views of the Pacific Ocean.\nCarrere believes Hawaii's volcanoes can be kid-friendly as well when you visit the Unesco-listed Volcanoes National Park on Hawaii's rugged Big Island. The park, a designated International Biosphere Reserve, is also the site of K\u012blauea and Mauna Loa \u2013 two of the world's most active volcanoes. But for Carrere, the park is a fantastic place for young people to learn about Hawaii's unique volcanic geological features \u2013 like lava tubes; natural tunnels formed by solidified lava flow.\nInsider tip:\nClimate conditions can change quickly in Hawaii, so be sure to check business and local weather websites to make sure that your planned activity is safe to visit \u2013 or if it's been temporarily cancelled to deal with tourist overflow. \"That's the hard thing,\" says Carrere. \"The caveat is you have to check to see if they're open for visitors, because sometimes places get overwhelmed with tourists. That's why I hesitate even to share my most intimate places.\"\n\"You can go through a lava tube,\" she says. \"It sounds scary, but the lava tube is long extinct. You walk through and there's water dripping, and there's ferns growing off the side. That lava tube is going to be fascinating for kids.\"\nVolcanoes National Park is also where you'll find another of Carrere's favourite family-friendly spots; the Volcano House Hotel. Sitting 1219m above sea level on the edge of the Kilauea Crater, the historic property offers vintage bungalows and cabins on the nearby campsite, allowing visitors to explore the park's natural beauty in comfort.\n\"There's another part of the volcano that has steam vents. It's freezing cold, and sometimes misty and rainy,\" warns Carrere. \"You have to wear a raincoat. The hot steam could burn your legs if you're not careful. But it's a fascinating place to share science with kids.\"\nWebsite: https://hawaiivolcanohouse.com/\nAddress: Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park, 1 Crater Rim Drive, P\u0101hoa, HI 96718, United States\nPhone: +18087569625\nInstagram: @hawaiivolcanohouse\nWhenever Carrere returns to Hawaii she has one goal: \"I'll eat my way around the island,\" she laughs. \"Every place that I ate when I was a kid!\"\nHawaiian cuisine is a reflection of the islands' multicultural heritage. \"[There was] a huge plantation culture here,\" explains Carrere. \"All the different cultures came from the Philippines, China, Japan, Portugal. They couldn't speak each other's languages, so the way everybody came together was with their food. Portuguese sweet bread, Filipino rice and fish dishes, Chinese noodles. All the flavours became this delicious m\u00e9lange of local cuisine.. If you have a macaroni salad here, it's not gonna taste like any macaroni salad you've had anywhere else. The roast pork is a different flavour. Those flavours are just different.\"\nCarrere's Hawaiian culinary picks involve the kid-friendly experience of curating your own meal, like Gina's Hawaiian-style Korean barbeque or St Louis Delicatessen, a Japanese okazuyaestablishment selling prepared foods to pack into a bento (lunch) box. For sweet tooths, Carrere loves shave ice. \"I always go to the School Street shave ice off the freeway. But by new favourite is Ululani's,\" she says. \"They have the most delicious all-natural flavours like guava and coconut. They're meticulous with their shave ice. It's very, very fine. I can't stand shave ice that's hard and crunchy\u2026 it should melt in your mouth, like the softest snow. That's what shave ice is; a huge block of ice that's scooped around and shaved. That's the only correct way.\"\nBut Carrere's first stop off the plane is always Liliha Bakery in Honolulu. \"It's the same counter that I grew up at when my grandma took me there; I must have been maybe eight the first time,\" she says. \"I like the hamburger steak plate with rice and macaroni salad and a butter roll and fruit punch\u2026. my grandma used to have the cheeseburger \u2013 and of course, the bun is divine, because [it's] homemade. They have the best pancakes for breakfast. The bakery goods, like ensa\u00efmada and lady fingers. Ensa\u00efmada is fantastic; it's a golden sweet bun with butter and sugar on top.\" She pauses. \"I'm dying right now just thinking about this.\"\nWebsite: https://www.lilihabakery.com/\nAddress: 515 N Kuakini St, Honolulu, HI 96817, United States\nPhone: +18085311651\nInstagram: @lilihabakery\nThe human history of the Hawaiian islands began with settlement by Polynesian peoples between 940 and 1200 AD. In the late 18th Century, Kamehameha I unified the islands and became the first ruler of the new Kingdom of Hawaii. The arrival of Europeans in the 17th Century led to the settlement of plantations and, eventually, a forced overthrow of the monarchy in the late 19th Century. Hawaii became a US state in 1959 and attracts millions of visitors with its spectacular beaches, towering volcanoes and laid-back lifestyle.\nCarrere recommends families visit Honolulu's Bishop Museum, \"if you want to learn about Hawaii and Hawaiian culture. They have an observatory too, with a whole thing about how to circumnavigate when you're on a boat and follow the stars. Bishop Museum for kids, 110%.\"\u00a0\nDid you know?\nQueen Lili'uokalani (1838-1917), the last reigning monarch of Hawaii, also composed the iconic Hawaiian song, Aloha 'Oe. \"The most famous song of love and heartbreak,\" says Carrere, wistfully. Listen to Carrere's achingly beautiful rendition here.\nFor a dive into Hawaii's imperial past, Carrere also recommends families with older children visit Honolulu's 'Iolani Palace; an opulent structure built in the \"American Florentine\" style which served as the Hawaiian royal palace.\n\"It's not my most favourite part of Hawaiian history,\" says Carrere. \"It's poignant and painful, but also fascinating [because] it's the only place in the US that was a royal palace. It's where Queen Lili'uokalaniwas imprisoned when [white businessmen] overthrew her monarchy. It's a fascinating period in Hawaiian history, but incredibly painful also to know that sugarcane plantation owners overthrew a sovereign nation by force.\"\nVisitors can explore the palace's first and second floors, which include reception rooms and bedrooms, as well as Queen Lili'uokalani's Imprisonment Room, where she was held under house arrest for nearly eight months after the coup.\nWebsite: https://www.bishopmuseum.org/\nAddress: 1525 Bernice St, Honolulu, HI 96817, United States\nPhone: +18088473511\nInstagram: @bishopmuseum \n\nWebsite: https://www.iolanipalace.org/\nAddress: 364 S King St, Honolulu, HI 96813\nPhone: +18085220832\nInstagram: @iolanipalacehi\nThe views, perfumes and sounds of Hawaii have remained with Carrere her entire life, and even more so since she moved to Hollywood. \"I used to take this for granted,\" she says. \"The colours, the blue of the ocean, the green of the trees and the grass. Everything is more vibrant. The air smells more beautiful\u2026. the Earth is much more inviting; it invites you to her pleasures.\"\nFor an unforgettable, memory-making sight, Carrere suggest families head to the Hale'mau'mau Crater overlook.\n\"I love [it],\" says Carrere. \"I went up there when my kid was small. You have to wake up before dawn to go up to see the sun rise over the caldera. It's stunning.\"\nInsider tip:\nIf you're looking for a way to give back to the land during your visit to Hawaii, Gohawaii.com hosts ongoing volunteer experiences; listed island by island.\nThe Hale'mau'mau Crater is located within the larger Kilauea Caldera. Closed in 2008 due to perilous volcanic activity, Hale'mau'mau's floor sunk 457m after a volcano eruption in 2018. Visitors with kids can drive up to the overlook point, where they can peer down at the immense, otherworldly gaping hole below. Or descend through the rainforest to the Halema'uma'u Trail; a moderate-level hike that takes you to the floor of the caldera.\n\"It's the adventure of going up there before dawn and up this windy, windy road, and just to stand there and see the majesty of the earth again,\" says Carrere. \"It just takes your breath away\u2026 the mountain moonscape of the volcano. It's the way the light hits it. It's magic. It just \u2013 poof \u2013 opens up before you.\"\nViews like this can create family memories that last a lifetime.\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

        "article_text": "In 1966, the BBC's Tomorrow's World visited a party in New York organised by the electronic dating service Tact, or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing. Around 2,000 singles were invited to Manhattan to try out this modern method of matchmaking.\nIn 1788, a man going by the name of \"AB\" placed New York's first known personal ad in the Impartial Gazetteer, according to historian Francesa Beauman. He was seeking a woman \"under 40, not deformed, and in possession of at least one thousand pounds\". Describing himself as \"a young gentleman of family and fortune, who is lately come to town\", the ad was the Tinder bio of its day. Whether AB had any replies to his ad is unknown. But nearly 200 years later, New York was the home of another novel approach to dating \u2013 computer matchmaking.\nInvented by Bob Ross (a computer programmer at IBM, not the painter), and accountant Lewis Altfest, Tact \u2013 or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing \u2013 launched in New York 60 years ago, in 1965. First confined to the Upper East Side, it soon expanded to the entire city and had thousands signing up to be matched by computer. Each hopeful had to pay $5 (\u00a32) and fill in a questionnaire, which would then be used to match people \"on three levels\", according to Ross: socio-cultural factors, opinions and values, and psychological factors. The answers were fed into the computer, which would then spit out supposed matches of the opposite gender. Same-sex dating was not an option. \"Tact is not a lonely-hearts club,\" Ross told the BBC's Tomorrow's World. \"It's not a marriage brokerage service. It's a new fun way of meeting new people.\" He pointed out that it was open to \"all fun-loving people between 18 and 45\", and added: \"People go into Tact for a number of reasons. Some of the people go into it just to meet new people, to get a lot of dates\u2026 some people want to get more serious, they are interested in forming a more lasting relationship, and then there are people who just want to get married.\"\nThe matchmaking questions were approved by psychologist Dr Salvatore V Didato, who felt there was \"a great social need\" for services such as Tact. He complained of other services, \"They say that they match people on many, many variables, but it winds up that they match them only on age, sex, religion, and height, or something like that.\" The Tact questionnaire went further by including a series of statements with which respondents had to either agree or disagree. The BBC report features responses from a typical customer: \"I worry over my relationships with people \u2013 yes. I enjoy people who express affection freely \u2013 yes. Most of the time I act as an independent \u2013 no. I enjoy going to parties \u2013 yes.\"\nWhile Tact was at the crest of a new technological wave, it was not quite the first computer-aided dating service. The two inventors had been inspired by Operation Match, which had been started earlier that year by Harvard students \u2013 decades before some students at the same university would create another computer-powered way for people to connect: Facebook.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nIn 1965, computers were still novel. Operation Match had to rent one of the university's computers for $100 an hour. It quickly proved popular, with thousands of students sending in questionnaires. \"You thought the computer was god, and the computer knew all,\" co-creator Jeff Tarr told the BBC's\u00a0Witness History\u00a0in 2014. Coincidentally, Tarr's daughter would go on to marry one of the creators of Match.com, one of the first internet dating sites. The computer provided reassurance: instead of relying on luck when finding your partner, you could be algorithmically matched to your soulmate.\nThe 1960s were a time of revolution. In the United States, the civil rights and second wave feminism movements were in full flow. Social norms were changing, and technology was developing quickly, too: the arrival of the computer coincided with society's increased permissiveness. By 1969, computer dating \u2013 or at least the idea of it \u2013 was mainstream enough to feature as a storyline in Bewitched, the supernatural sitcom. Samantha's cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery plays both characters) signs up to a computer dating service to find a mortal to marry, only to be matched with a warlock. Even Bob Ross himself found love through Tact \u2013 although it wasn't thanks to the computer. According to a New Yorker article published in the New Yorker in 2011, he eventually married a journalist who interviewed him about the project.\nTact's thousands of willing customers signalled a shift away from the more formal courtship culture of the first half of the century, and towards more modern attitudes. However, these early computer matchmaking services did not last long. While some people found their perfect partners, the services had a few fatal limitations. Because the services were primarily aimed at middle-class college students and graduates, there was a finite pool of potential matches. Also, the system was inefficient \u2013 it could be weeks between sending off your questionnaire and receiving your matches, who you then had to contact by phone or post. The parties organised by Tact were an attempt to get matches to mingle despite the distances that might be involved. Even then, it could still be awkward. The BBC's report pointed out that even \"a public relations man present couldn't get this party going until after dark,\" despite a prize of \"a big night out on the town\" for the most compatible couple present. Possibly the paper sign hung between two bins did not inspire confidence in the service.\nThe questions left something to be desired, too. As well as all the basic demographic and attraction-related queries, the form's \"dislikes\" section had options such as \"homosexuals\" and \"interracial couples\". The questionnaire also played to stereotypes: according to the New Yorker, men were asked to rank women's hairstyles, whereas women could specify where they could find their ideal man: chopping wood, painting in a studio, or in a garage.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The risqu\u00e9 romcom that defined a genre\n\u2022\u00a0The man behind the puzzle that 99% can't solve\n\u2022\u00a0Gloria Steinem on the trailblazing Ms Magazine\nWhile the creators were proud of the detail in their \"three levels\" of compatibility testing, their Cupid's arrows weren't always on target. \"We matched an older brother with his younger sister,\" admitted Ross. \"That didn't work out too well.\" He also said they'd had \"a number of people who weren't too satisfied after they've gone out\". On Tomorrow's World, one potential client quizzed Dr Didato on the robustness of the matching computer, after a bad experience with another service. \"She specified an age limit and gets some guy 20 years older!\"\nStill, while Tact, Operation Match and other similar services now seem comparatively quaint, people keep using technology to guide them towards romance \u2013 from the first personal ads in newspapers to video dating services, from online dating sites to AI-aided apps. According to Pew Research, one in 10 people who had partners in the US in 2023 met them via online dating. When it comes to matters of the heart, it seems, we can't help falling in love with the latest innovations.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Ramon Diaz spent only six months of his near 30-year managing career working in Europe - at Oxford United\nTwenty years ago a Copa Libertadores-winning legend turned up to manage mid-table fourth tier side Oxford United.\nSix months later Ramon Diaz and the rest of his seven-man entourage were blocked from even entering the ground.\nIt seems unlikely anybody will ever join the former River Plate manager, who played for Argentina, Inter Milan, Monaco and others, in winning South America's top tournament - and the League Two manager of the month award.\nBBC Sport tell the story with help from former players Steve Basham, Chris Tardif and Lucas Cominelli, BBC Oxford editor Jerome Sale, and Jean Marc Goiran, the man who brokered the deal and acted as assistant manager, translator and unofficial chief executive.\nFitness coach Pablo Fernandez, translator Guilliano Iacoppi, boss Ramon Diaz, coach Horatio Rodriguez and assistant Jean Marc Goiran (pictured from left to right) were five of the seven-strong party\nIt was December 2004. \nOxford United, the 1986 League Cup winners, were in a slump, having dropped from the second tier to the fourth since 1999 - and were sliding down League Two when owner Firoz Kassam sacked Graham Rix.\nKassam, the club's unpopular owner, invited out-of-work manager Chris Turner to watch their 1-0 defeat by Swansea - and most people thought he was the new manager, including the Oxford Mail, external and some players.\nBut instead... \"It was quite bizarre,\" said former U's striker Basham. \"Five or six guys came in, in a line. They all stood in front of us and none of them spoke a word of English, apart from one translator.\"\nGoiran said \"all the players had wide-open eyes wondering 'who are these guys?'\".\nThose guys were Diaz, head coach Horacio Rodriguez, another coach Raul Marcovich, Goiran, fitness trainer Pablo Fernandez, doctor Rafael Giulietti and translator Giuilliano Iacoppi.\nBut wait, how did it come to this? It all starts in Monaco - where Kassam and Goiran lived and Diaz also had a home having played for the club.\nKassam approached a friend of a friend, Goiran, who has worked as a football agent and consultant, to help him find a manager and the Monegasque suggested Diaz - who had left River Plate in 2002.\nAt the time it was widely reported that Diaz was not being paid to be Oxford manager - and Kassam said he had \"promised him shares in the club in return for success\".\nBut Goiran, speaking 20 years on, says Kassam's company Firoka, but not the club, instead paid Diaz and Goiran consulting fees in Monaco.\nAnd the question many have asked - why did a manager with five Argentine titles and the Copa Libertadores come to League Two Oxford? \nGoiran says it was part of a project to get to the Premier League in five years - but after a bitter ending, Diaz, who is now Corinthians manager in Brazil, never worked in England or even Europe again.\n\"When they first came in, there were grand talks about redeveloping the stadium, putting a new stand behind the goal and taking us into the Premier League,\" said goalkeeper Tardif.\nBack in 2004 there was less foreign involvement in the lower leagues in England, so it was an even big culture shock then than it is now.\nBut many of the players bought into the new training ideas, although some struggled to adapt.\n\"They brought something very new and very fresh to Oxford United at that time,\" said Basham, who played for the club between 2002 and 2007.\n\"It was way before its time. They came in with ideas and the philosophy that probably hit the English game two, three, four years later, certainly in the lower leagues.\"\nRodriguez would be hands-on - with Diaz overseeing things. To some around the club Rodriguez was seen as the traditional boss of the team with Diaz almost a director of football.\nDiaz and his coaches only spoke broken English, so had to communicate via their translator.\nBut Goiran, who was involved on the training pitch too, says Diaz was the manager and had the final say in everything. \nBasham said: \"He [Diaz] would come in amongst the team as we were laid out in our shape and he would take us through with movements. Very different, but it worked. \n\"He'd physically move you, he would then have you alongside him and he'd make the runs and you would make those runs with him.\"\nGoiran said: \"It was a very nice atmosphere. It was a great adventure. We changed the way they trained, the mentality. We taught them they are football players.\"\nThey were popular figures off the pitch too.\nBBC Oxford's Sale said: \"Ramon and his staff were imposing and impressive, but also gentle and friendly. \n\"He once asked me for $100,000 for interviews. I said the BBC wouldn't stretch that far. He said just to bring him a decent coffee next time then.\"\nRamon Diaz and his entourage were popular with the Oxford fans\nIt all started so well. They had been brought in to help the club avoid relegation but four wins and two draws in January got them dreaming of the play-offs - and Diaz was named League Two manager of the month.\nRemarkably it would take over 17 years for another Oxford manager to win an EFL award like that again - Liam Manning in September 2023.\n\"There was an immediate buzz around the ground,\" said BBC commentator Sale. \"The football went up a notch and the fun came back.\"\nDiaz and co had brought in a proper attacking style of football. Fitness and pressing were a big part of it too.\n\"We changed completely the way they play and they started to win,\" said Goiran.\n\"When a player starts to win they have pleasure, the mentality is better, they have confidence.\"\nBasham said: \"They were very much wanting to play football, which suited most of the team. \n\"I love getting the football down, love playing football, love linking play up and working to a strategy. So it was a bit different, certainly from the Ian Atkins [pragmatic lower-league manager who left Oxford in April 2004] times, which I enjoyed too.\"\nOne of Diaz's innovative strategies was leaving three quick players up the pitch while they were defending a corner in case of a counter-attacking possibility.\n\"It was more of a Pep philosophy in terms of total football even at that level,\" said Tardif, referring to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.\n\"It\u2019s great when it's all world-class players but in the lower leagues it's not always possible. They tried to enforce football at its purest form. We tried it. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it failed.\"\nLucas Cominelli was offered a new deal to stay with Oxford, but new manager Brian Talbot did not want any of the Argentines \nThe new management team wanted to freshen up the squad and brought in a host of trialists - some days about half of the people training were trialists.\nOut of those came a few South American signings - midfielder Lucas Cominelli, winger Juan Pablo Raponi and Uruguayan defender Mateo Corbo. Diaz's sons Emiliano and Michael - who was young and never played for the first team - also joined.\nResults were mixed.\nCominelli played 16 times, scoring a long-range effort against Grimsby, and was seen as one of the successes.\n\"Oxford were fantastic,\" said Cominelli, who had once been on the books of Newcastle without making a first-team appearance.\n\"It was really good. I had a good experience, a good memory of it from the fans, the city, the club.\"\nFull-back Corbo remains a cult hero at the club after eight yellow cards and a red card in 13 games.\nRaponi, who had played for River Plate, was too lightweight for League Two but played 10 times.\nEmiliano Diaz, who played seven times, is often mentioned in discussions about Oxford's worst ever players.\nThat was just one of many times he worked with his dad - having played under Ramon at River Plate and been his assistant manager at over 10 teams since retiring.\nCominelli added there were never issues between the England and South American players.\n\"The team-mates were really OK,\" he said. \"It was really welcome. They helped and everything. We had a good dressing room.\"\nBasham added: \"Some [were] good, some not so good. Some fitted in really well. A couple were superb, really worked hard, good on the ball, really good additions to the side. \n\"And then you had one or two that it didn't quite work out for them.\n\"Raponi was very quick, he made an impact at times, but the physical side of the game sometimes was a bit too much for him.\"\nThe falling out between Firoz Kassam (left) and Ramon Diaz (right) over the ambitions of the club proved to be the downfall of the experiment\nAfter the good run in January, though, Oxford's form took a dip, losing four of the next five games.\nAnd things were unravelling off the pitch too.\nDiaz and Kassam fell out over a difference of opinion in the ambition of the club - and over Diaz not speaking English.\nThe manager, plus some of his coaches, missed a few games for work permit or passport reasons.\nBasham said it just \"fizzled out\" as the club finished 15th - nowhere near the top or bottom.\n\"It's almost surreal looking back,\" said Tardif. \"It was difficult for them coming in our level. They weren't quite ready for having to do the basics over and over again. \n\"I really liked them as people. Do I think it was the right match? Probably not.\"\nGoiran was in discussions with Kassam about how to structure the club's marketing and finding investment. \n\"There were a lot of things to do because the club was not professional for me,\" he said. \"I spent about 12 hours per day minimum working on that and we made a lot of progress. \n\"I was more like a chief executive than other things - but I was still close on the training ground.\n\"The relationship between Ramon and Firoz was difficult. They discussed the future and financial things. Ramon didn't feel that Firoz would like to grow [the club].\"\nBasham said: \"I think they had really big plans for Oxford United. They were all pushing in the right direction.\n\"I think they all thought they were close to some sort of deal with Kassam and for whatever reason it all just ended up... yeah, there was a big fallout, which was a real shame.\"\nOnce it was obvious Diaz would probably leave the club, Goiran tried to find another manager for the project.\nDiaz resigned as manager and he and his sons flew home before the penultimate game of the season. \n\"His decision to leave was unexpected and I am disappointed,\" said Kassam at the time - who added keeping Diaz would have cost the club \u00a31m.\nThe Oxford Mail even reported that Rodriguez was set to become the new manager., external\nBut suddenly the entire experiment was over. Before the final game of the season, at home to Chester, Kassam got rid of Diaz's entire backroom staff and appointed Brian Talbot.\nGoiran was offered the chance to stay but said \"I brought these people in and if they're going out I have to go with them\". \n\"Everything was so OK except the relationship between Firoz and Ramon. We had a lot of good plans for the future, a lot of ideas regarding investors to change the club and grow. But it was a bad ending,\" Goiran said.\nAnd it got very messy as Diaz and his coaches bought tickets to watch the final game of the season against Chester and to say thank you to the Oxford supporters.\nBut Kassam ordered his stewards to refuse them entry and an argument broke out 10 minutes into the game - with fans leaving their seats to ask they be let in.\n\"We had to take the car and left everything there. It was not a good ending,\" said Goiran.\n\"I was very sad to leave the club. It was a fantastic time. I did it with my heart plus everything. The feeling I have with the fans was 'wow'. \n\"It's my club forever - I\u2019m always looking at their results. It's a love story between me and Oxford.\"\nThat was the end of all the South American players too.\nCominelli said: \"The club had offered me a new contract.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is expected to face fierce resistance from Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House today, in their first meeting since the US president proposed moving Gaza's population to Jordan.\nJordan, a key US ally, has been treading a tightrope between its military and diplomatic ties, and popular support for the Palestinians at home.\nThose fault lines, already tested by the Gaza War, are being pushed to breaking point by Trump's plans for Gaza's peace.\nHe has expanded on his demand that Gazans be moved to Jordan and Egypt, telling a Fox News anchor that they would not have the right to return home \u2013 a vision that, if enforced, would contravene international law.\nOn Monday he said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they did not take in Palestinian refugees.\nSome of the fiercest opponents of moving Gazans to Jordan are the Gazans who moved here before.\nSome 45,000 people live crammed into the Gaza Camp, near Jordan's northern town of Jerash, one of several Palestinian refugee camps here.\nSheets of corrugated iron hang over narrow shop doorways, and children rattle along on donkeys between the market stalls.\nAll the families here trace their roots back to Gaza: to Jabalia, Rafah, Beit Hanoun.  Most left after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, seeking temporary shelter. Generations later, they are still here.\n\"Donald Trump is an arrogant narcissist,\" 60-year-old Maher Azazi tells me. \"He has a mentality from the Middle Ages, the mentality of a tradesman.\"\nMaher left Jabalia as a toddler. Some of his family are still there, now picking through the rubble of their home for the bodies of 18 missing relatives.\nDespite the devastation there, Mr Azazi says Gazans today have learned the lessons of previous generations and most \"would rather jump into the sea than leave\".\nThose who once saw leaving as a temporary bid for refuge, now see it as helping Israel's far-right nationalists take Palestinian land.\n\"We Gazans have been through this before,\" says Yousef, who was born in the camp.  \"Back then, they told us it would be temporary, and we would return to our home.  The right to return is a red line.\"\n\"When our ancestors left, they had no weapons to fight, like Hamas has now,\" another man tells me. \"Now the younger generation are fully aware of what happened with our ancestors, and it will never happen again. Now there is resistance.\"\nPalestinians are not the only ones to seek refuge in Jordan \u2013 a tiny superpower of stability surrounded by the Middle East's many conflicts.\nIraqis arrived here, fleeing war in the early 2000s. A decade later, Syrians came too, prompting Jordan's king to warn that his country was at \"boiling point\".\nMany native Jordanians blame the waves of refugees for high unemployment and poverty at home. A food bank by the mosque in central Amman told us it hands out 1,000 meals a day.\nWaiting for work outside the mosque, we met Imad Abdallah and his friend Hassan \u2013 both day labourers who have not worked in months.\n\"The situation in Jordan used to be great, but when there was the war in Iraq, things got worse, when there was the war in Syria, it got worse, now there's a war in Gaza, it's got a lot worse,\" Hassan said. \"Any war that happens near us, we become worse off, because we're a country that helps and takes people in.\"\nImad was blunter, worried about feeding his four children.\n\"The foreigners come, and take our jobs,\" he told me. \"Now I'm four months without a job. I have no money, no food. If Gazans come, we will die.\"\nBut Jordan is also under pressure from its key military ally. Trump has already suspended to it US aid worth more than $1.5 billion a year.  And many here are braced for a growing confrontation between the new US president and their own political leaders, who are pushing back.\nJawad Anani, a former deputy prime minister close to the Jordanian government, says King Abdullah's message to Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday will be clear: \"We consider any attempt by Israel or others to push people out of their own houses in Gaza and the West Bank as a criminal act. But any attempt to push those people into Jordan will be tantamount to a declaration of war.\"\nEven if Gazans wanted to relocate voluntarily, on a temporary basis, as part of a wider Middle East plan, he said, the trust simply was not there.\n\"There is no confidence,\" he said. \"As long as Netanyahu is involved, he and his government, there is no confidence in any promises that anybody makes. Period.\"\nTrump's determination to push his vision for Gaza could end up pushing a key US ally into a critical choice.\nLast Friday, thousands protested here against Trump's proposal.\nJordan is home to US military bases, and millions of refugees, and its security co-operation is crucial for Israel, worried about smuggling routes into the occupied West Bank.\nAny risks to Jordan's stability mean risks for its allies too. If stability is Jordan's superpower, the threat of unrest is its biggest weapon and its best defence.\nAdditional reporting: Mohamed Madi, BBC News",

Porter charged at Scotsmen with ball in hand and at the breakdown all afternoon.\nHis clear-out of the ruck allowed Ireland quick ball for James Lowe to score their third try before his neat hands created the opportunity for Jack Conan to claim the fourth.\nMarler picks Porter as his loosehead of round two, while he also selects former England team-mate Will Stuart.\nLike Porter, tighthead Stuart was influential in the set-piece and from open play as England claimed revenge for their record defeat by Les Bleus two years ago.\n\"I have been really impressed with Will Stuart,\" said Marler. \n\"He has had a number of chances over the last couple of seasons but has not really been able to bring his club form with Bath to the international stage. \n\"He is now putting in some really big performances.\"\nAshton, meanwhile, selects England loosehead Ellis Genge for his tenacity in the loose and leadership as Borthwick's vice-captain. \nThis video can not be played\nSix Nations - Best moments of Week 2\nLions watch: Who impressed in Six Nations round one?\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings & coverage",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis year's tournament marks 25 years since the beginning of the Six Nations era.\nOver the past quarter of a century, the championship has played host to some true greats of the game and, in current France captain Antoine Dupont, has a player seemingly taking the game to another level.\nBBC Sport takes a look at each nation's standout stars since 2000 and the impact they have had on this competition, before giving you the chance to make your selection of who you think is the greatest player in Six Nations history.\nStatistics provided by Opta and correct on 6 February, 2025\nSuch has been Antoine Dupont's impact since making his France debut in 2017, numbers alone do not get close to doing him justice.\nThe frame of a bull, the acceleration of a wing and technical skills from the gods - Dupont's skillset is otherworldly. A scrum-half who matches 20 try assists in the Six Nations with 20 turnovers simply is not normal.\nIt is not just in the XV-a-side game that Dupont has excelled. The prospect of representing his country at a home Olympics last year meant he missed the 2024 Six Nations to focus on sevens, and Dupont scored two tries as France beat favourites Fiji to win the gold medal at the Paris Games.\n\"The boys joke around and call him 'The Martian' as he is not from earth, he is an alien,\" said Toulouse lock Emmanuel Meafou before last year's Champions Cup final. \"The stuff he does in games is only half of what he is capable of.\"\nAnd yet that half is better than virtually anyone else. In France's 43-0 win against Wales on Friday, the 28-year-old's shift lasted barely 50 minutes and yet he became the first player to provide three try assists in two separate men's Six Nations matches.\nThe cross-field kick for Theo Attissogbe's opening score was so casual, it was almost offensive.\nDupont next visits Twickenham's Allianz Stadium, where he masterminded a record rout of seven tries in 2023. The England camp have been keen to stress this week that the 2022 Grand Slam-winning captain is only human, but his reputation is becoming anything but.\nJonny Wilkinson will always be synonymous with drop-kicking England to World Cup glory in Sydney in 2003 but his record in the Six Nations is equally impressive.\nIn 2001, when he won back-to-back titles with England, Wilkinson set overall records for points (89) and conversions (24) that are yet to be surpassed in a single edition of this tournament.\nWilkinson's peerless game management and place-kicking were underpinned by the fiercest of work ethics and desire to put his body on the line, a combativeness that helped the fly-half face down depression and panic attacks during his career.\nEngland's Six Nations win-rate with Wilkinson in the team was 74%, while he made 172 of 211 kicks at goal and ranked fifth of any player for try assists (17).\n\"Jonny instilled confidence in those who played with him and took confidence away from those he played against,\" said former Six Nations team-mate Richard Hill. \"There were many matches we would have lost without him.\"\nThe influence of the most-capped player in history has perhaps been most keenly felt since his retirement.\nSince Alun Wyn Jones officially called time on an 18-year international career in 2023, Wales have won just five of 20 Tests, losing all six in the Six Nations.\nHe made his Six Nations debut in 2007, while his last appearance came against France two years ago. His tally of 67 appearances in the championship is the second-most of any player, while the second-row totem is the top tackler in the tournament's history (752 at 93% success rate).\nThe 2019 Six Nations player of the year has won five Six Nations championships and three Grand Slams - both the most of anybody on this list.\n\"He always strived to be the best and over a long period he has achieved that,\" said Wales' record points scorer Neil Jenkins. \"Wales have had some incredible rugby players and he is up there as one of the best, if not the best.\"\nWatching Brian O'Driscoll dart through defences almost at will was a joyous experience - unless you were among those tasked with trying to stop him.\nElusive and formidable, O'Driscoll played with an ease which belied the sheer seriousness of his numbers; 163 defenders beaten, 82 offloads, 53 turnovers, 45 wins and 26 tries - all of which stand as Six Nations records despite his retirement more than a decade ago.\nThe centre's final Six Nations campaign in 2014 provided a fairytale ending; a knee-knocking triumph in Paris that saw O'Driscoll win his second championship on his 133rd, and last, cap for Ireland.\nIt came 14 years after the 2009 Grand Slam winner burst onto the Six Nations scene by scoring one of the tournament's most iconic hat-tricks against France in the same stadium.\nSometimes moments matter more than statistics.\nWhen Scotland prepared to face England at Murrayfield in 2018, they had not beaten their oldest rivals in a decade. The visitors had lost just once in all 25 Tests under head coach Eddie Jones.\nEnter Finn Russell and one of the standout Six Nations performances.\nScotland's fly-half unfurled his catalogue of unhurried skills to confound English defenders, an overpowering influence personified by his involvement in Scotland's second try.\nA huge miss-pass, sailing over bewildered opponents on the edge of his own 22, led to a Huw Jones break and Russell was involved again, his floated pass finding Sean Maitland to score.\nRussell subsequently added consistency to his mercurial make-up. His success rate of 84.7% from the tee ranks him second only to Dan Biggar of all regular kickers over the past 25 years - he missed one kick in total in 2024 - while his 20 try assists is a tally only bettered by Ireland's Conor Murray (29).\nPerhaps the highest praise that can be paid to Italy's greatest captain is that he would have commanded a starting place in any side during his Six Nations career.\nItaly won just nine games over 16 years with Sergio Parisse in the team but their talisman never stopped - he made 785 carries, 244 more than any other player in Six Nations history.\nThe back-row behemoth also gained a remarkable 3,088m, ranking him second since 2000 - and every other player in the top 10 for carries is a back.\nEighty defenders beaten, 540 tackles at an 88% success rate and 198 line-outs taken.\nParisse was there for Italy's first away point against Wales in 2006, their first back-to-back wins in 2007 - including a maiden away victory in Scotland - and he captained the side to a first win against France in 2011.\nHe also scored one of the great Six Nations tries following a sweeping counter-attack in another win against Les Bleus in 2013 and followed that up several weeks later by starring in the Azzurri's first defeat of Ireland.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT",

        "article_text": "From Colombia's upcycled sewer pipes to spheres suspended in the sky in Canada, capsule hotels have been reinvented for a new generation of travellers.\nBy night, the world's first capsule hotel (founded in Osaka, Japan in 1979) must have looked like a morgue, with neat rows of narrow sleeping capsules each containing a recumbent body. But the following day, the occupants \u2013 mostly businessmen who had worked late - would rise up and head back to the office, grateful for this efficient sleep solution that had saved them a commute home in the early hours.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the concept spread, tourists happy to sleep in a room no bigger than its bed began to bunk up alongside them, eager to sample this unusual aspect of Japanese culture. Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled by years of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the current boom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security.\nWith the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers. They're tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, from upcycled sewer pipes in the Colombian desert to space-age pods with a dashboard of ambient controls in downtown Sydney, Australia \u2013 all promising a unique experience and shareable stories for social media. Meanwhile capsule-cum-bookstores invite book lovers to snooze among the shelves, and boutique versions bring luxury to a traditionally no-frills market with fancy decor or promises of fluffy duck-feather duvets.\nAs the concept continues to reinvent itself, here are eight of the most extraordinary examples.\nNine Hours, a chain of 13 hotels across Japan, from Fukuoka in the west to the north-east island of Hokkaido, has an unusual by-product: sleep data. In the Shinagawa Station (men only) and Akasaka branches, guests can sign up for a \"9h sleep fitscan\" service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report that tracks their heart rate, identifies sleep apnea and even monitors snoring. In a sector where a novel or low-budget stay is often prioritised over comfort, Nine Hours' interest in how well its guests are sleeping sets it apart.\nAcross the franchise, the white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods would not look out of place on the set of a science-fiction movie. The name refers to the hotel's cost-cutting concept that reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Just need a nap? Hourly rates are also available.\nA night in a transparent sleeping pod clinging to a cliff face above Peru's Sacred Valley is not everyone's idea of a relaxing stay, but for adrenaline-lovers, it's hard to beat \u2013 not least for the incredible 300-degree views of the surrounding mountains and the formidable condors that inhabit them.\nA near-vertical climb of 400m is the only way to reach the Skylodge Adventure Suites, but climbing experience is not necessary \u2013 only good health and a head for heights \u2013 and descending is speedier thanks to a series of zip wires. Each capsule includes a private bathroom ensuring that night trips to the toilet are not life-threatening, and when the sun rises, you can enjoy a cup of tea on your private deck. Looking for a little more luxury? A little further down the Urubamba river, sister site, Starlodge, adds hillside hot tubs to the capsule hotel experience.\nThe Tubo Hotel, La Tatacoa is just a 10-minute drive from Colombia's second-largest desert, the eponymous Tatacoa, famous for its clear starry skies. When you've taken in the giant cacti and curious rock formations of the Tatacoa's cinnamon-coloured sands, this rainbow of tiny, air-conditioned rooms with a shared swimming pool offers a welcome oasis. The 37 capsules are fashioned from concrete sewer pipes painted in candy colours, providing just enough room for a double bed. Almost half of the rooms have a shared bathroom, but the room rate is a snip and you've a shady garden, bar and restaurant on your doorstep. \"This innovative and colourful place offers you a unique experience,\" says Ambar Quintana, the hotel's administrator. \"It has everything you need to rest in a natural environment of fresh air and vegetation.\"\nSuspended among the conifers like oversized Christmas baubles, the Free Spirit Spheres on Vancouver Island, Canada, feel \"like you are floating in the canopy among the sleeping birds\", according to owner Tom Chudleigh. The first sphere was introduced 25 years ago, driven by a desire to promote ecotourism and preserve Canada's ancient forests.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\n\u2022 The best travel photographs from around the globe\n\u2022 The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\nThere are currently three spheres, each based on the principle of biomimicry and shaped with a giant seed pod or nutshell in mind: light but with a strong shell. \"Eryn\" is fashioned from Sitka spruce and has a dining area, sink and slightly undersized double bed inside; while more recent additions, \"Melody\" and \"Luna\", are fibreglass and have similar amenities but with full-size double beds that can be stowed. Each sphere is accessed via a spiral staircase wrapped around a tree, and is available to rent in temperatures as low as -20C, when even a trip to the composting toilet at the accommodation's base will feel intrepid.\nThe shape makes bespoke fittings a prerequisite, and every little detail has been meticulously crafted by Chudleigh, from walnut fold-out furniture that maximises the space, to door handles cast from bronze.\nInside a Brutalist building in Singapore's Chinatown lies a surprisingly serene interior. Opened in 2021 and based on an aesthetic it describes as \"soft minimalist\", KINN Capsule offers a Zen take on the capsule concept with walls painted in calming peachy tones and pale wood sleeping chambers fitted with crisp white bed linen. Even the smell of the place seems an antidote to its urban location as a special house fragrance designed to evoke the wildflowers of a Nordic forest hangs in the air. There are 72 capsules in total, sealed off with blackout blinds and spread across seven rooms, but the vibe is more boutique than bunkhouse.\nA traditional mud and wood farmhouse in eastern China's Zhejiang Province got a prize-winning makeover in 2019 when it reopened as a capsule hostel, bookstore and community library, sleeping 20 in tiny single bed-sized compartments concealed between bookshelves made of local bamboo. A smattering of small landings are connected by zigzagging stairways that recall the serpentine paths of the surrounding forests of Tonglu. It's hard to know which is more dramatic: the remote building's transparent floor-to-ceiling panels that light it up like a cathedral at night, or the lush mountainous scenery that's visible through them.\nIn Oud Zuid, one of Amsterdam's most upscale neighbourhoods, guests are paying to sleep in cupboards. The quirky De Bedstee Hotel draws on the 17th-Century tradition of the Dutch bedstee (box bed), a bed concealed behind cupboard doors to create a cosy sleeping nook. The hotel's Art Deco features and acid-coloured wallpapers downstairs give way to a shabby-chic design in the first-floor dormitories, where the bedstee windows are framed by red gingham curtains and little wooden ladders lead to the capsules above. Relax in the hotel's small terrace garden or take a half-hour stroll to the Rembrandt House Museum in the city centre to see several historic box beds in situ.\nAnother hotel with a signature smell is the Resol Poshtel in Tokyo's Asakusa district \u2013 the Resol Hotel chain's first venture into capsule sleeping. The aroma, which includes orange, chamomile and neroli, is said to induce \"a feeling of gentle calm\" \u2013 of benefit, perhaps, given the communal sleeping arrangements. At bedtime, there's nothing but a curtain between you and fellow visitors, but few one-star establishments can match this hotel's cleanliness and functionality, with hairbrushes, slippers and razors included in the freebies. The Edo-era styling \u2212 such as the sleeping cubicles' arched entrance reminiscent of tea ceremony rooms, and the traditional Japanese murals surrounding the bed \u2212 add a hint of heritage to the hotel's modern lines. The city's oldest Buddhist temple, Sens\u014d-ji, is a five-minute walk away, as is the lantern-lined Nakamise-dori street, home to a parade of colourful shops selling souvenirs and street food.\n--\nThis story was first published in August and was one of our most-read Travel stories of the year.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Vittorio Sella was a pioneering Italian photographer whose work at the turn of the 20th Century shaped both mountain photography and mountaineering history. \nHis rare images of the Himalayas remain some of the most iconic ever captured.\nA new ongoing show in the Indian capital, Delhi, called Vittorio Sella: Photographer in the Himalaya brings to life the breathtaking grandeur of the Himalayas through his lens.\nCurated by renowned British explorer and author Hugh Thomson and organised by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), the show is likely one of the largest collection of Sella's Indian views. \nIt features some of the earliest high-altitude photographs of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, and K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, captured over a century ago.\nBorn in Biella, a town known for its wool trade in northern Italy, Sella (1859\u20131943)  made his first ascents in the nearby Alps. \n\"Throughout his career Sella made use of his skills in engineering and chemistry that the wool mills and his father had taught him,\" says Thomson.\nBy his twenties, he had mastered complex photographic techniques like the collodion process, enabling him to develop large-format glass plates under harsh conditions. \nHis panoramic images, crafted with technical perfection, earned worldwide acclaim.\nSella's Himalayan journey began in 1899 when he joined British explorer Douglas Freshfield on an expedition circumnavigating Kanchenjunga.\nAny circumnavigation of the mountain also involved an incursion into Nepal, which was also a closed kingdom.\nWhile the team's climbing ambitions were thwarted by relentless rain, Sella seized the opportunity to capture pristine snow-dusted peaks. He experimented restlessly with technology, trying out telephoto pictures of Kanchenjunga. His images  transported viewers to a world untouched by time.   \nA decade later, Sella reached new heights - both literally and artistically - on a 1909 expedition to K2 with the Duke of the Abruzzi. \nHis photographs of the world's most difficult mountain stand as a testament to his skill and resilience. Carrying a camera system weighing nearly 30kg, Sella crisscrossed treacherous landscapes, creating images that defined mountain photography.\nJim Curran, author of K2: The Story of the Savage Mountain, calls Sella \"possibly the greatest mountain photographer... his name [is] synonymous with technical perfection and aesthetic refinement\".\nSella was known for his extraordinary toughness, traversing the Alps at remarkable speed despite carrying heavy photographic gear. \nHis makeshift camera harness and boots - three times heavier than modern ones - are preserved at the Photographic Institute in Biella. \nHis clothing alone weighed over 10kg, while his camera equipment, including a Dallmeyer camera, tripod, and plates, added another 30kg - more than today's airline baggage limits.  \nOn the K2 expedition, Sella captured around 250 formal photographs with his Ross & Co camera over four to five months; on Kanchenjunga, about 200, notes Thomson.\n\"By modern digital standards, this number is nothing extraordinary -  and even in the last days of analogue film, it would equate to some eight rolls, what a 1970s photographer could have used in a single morning on a single mountain - but when Sella was photographing, this was a considerable number. \n\"This meant enormous care and thought was given to each photograph, both because he had relatively few plates he could shoot.\" \nYears later, the famous mountaineer-photographer Ansel Adams would write that the \"purity of Sella's interpretations move the spectator to a religious awe\".\nHigh-altitude photography came with risks - many of Sella's most ambitious shots were ruined when humid conditions caused tissue dividers to stick to the negatives. \nYet those that survived reveal a masterful eye, notes Thomson. \n\"Sella was one of the first to recognise how tracks in the snow are as much part of the composition as the mountaineers who made them.\"   \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "From the return of HBO's holiday-resort satire to a political thriller starring Robert De Niro and the latest violent period drama from Peaky Blinders creator Stephen Knight.\nAfter Jane Austen died, in 1817, her sister, Cassandra, destroyed many of her letters, guarding her privacy and setting generations of Janeites' and scholars' hair on fire. Miss Austen, based on Gill Hornby's bestselling novel, imagines what might have been behind all that. The series is wonderfully cast, with Keeley Hawes as Cassandra. It begins years after Jane's death, when Cassandra visits Isabella Fowle (Rose Leslie), \u00a0the niece of her long-dead fianc\u00e9, with the secret purpose of trying to find letters from Jane that might be in the vicarage. In flashbacks, Synnove Karlsen is the younger Cassandra and Patsy Ferran the young Jane. Max Irons and Alfred Enoch are also in the cast, because an Austen story always needs romance. Hawes teased the show in an interview with the Guardian, saying: \u201cIt feels like a classic costume drama, in the vein of Colin Firth in\u00a0Pride and Prejudice. Modern takes like Bridgerton are brilliant, but this feels like part of the Austen canon, so her fans will be pleased.\" The Austen industry is in overdrive this year, the 250th anniversary of her birth, but few projects are as tempting as this.\nMiss Austen premieres 2 February on BBC in the UK and 4 May on PBS in the US\nKaitlyn Dever, who has been great at comedy (Booksmart) and drama (2019 miniseries Unbelievable), takes on a bit of both in this fictional version of a true story. She plays Belle Gibson, an Australian influencer and con woman, who falsely said she had brain cancer and was curing it with natural ingredients and lifestyle, turning that lie into a financial empire selling apps and cookbooks. The show goes beyond her to include four other women in her orbit. One of them is under her spell, another becomes a business rival. The series is set in the early 2010s, at the dawn of Instagram, and tackles the rise of social media influencers. You can guess at its appeal. The show seems to echo the Netflix hit Inventing Anna, with Julia Garner as Anna Delvey, who masqueraded as an heiress, and was convicted of grand larceny and theft of services for her cons.\nApple Cider Vinegar premieres 6 February on Netflix internationally\nLaverne Cox stars in one of the last projects executive produced by the comedy legend Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at 101. She plays Desiree, a New York art gallery owner whose business collapses, and who returns home to Mobile, Alabama after 23 years away. Putting a new gender spin on some old sitcom tropes, the premise is that her father, Harry (comedian George Wallace), a car-wash owner she hasn't spoken to in all that time, has no idea that the child he thought of as his son has transitioned. Desiree moves into her old room, and the odd-couple, city-girl-in-a-small-town jokes begin, including one that has Harry putting money in a \"Pronoun Jar\" whenever he accidentally calls Desiree \"son\". Cox has been a staple of red carpet awards coverage lately. However this series turns out, it's probably time to remember how good she was in Orange is the New Black.\nClean Slate premieres 6 February on Amazon Prime\nThis drama about the decades-long aftershocks from a high-school soccer team's plane crash is another show returning after such a long gap, almost two years, that you need a refresher course before watching. Last season, as if being stranded in the woods and resorting to cannibalism when they were teenage girls wasn't enough, the adult versions of the characters faced life-or-death horror at the isolated location where Lottie (Simone Kessell) has formed a cult. As the adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey, the show's anchor) says in the third season trailer, \"Someone wants us dead\". Whoever it is already got poor Natalie in season two. The back-and-forth in time continues, with the main cast returning, including Lauren Ambrose as the adult Van, and Liv Hewson as her younger self, Christina Ricci as adult Misty, always up to something suspicious, and Elijah Wood as Walter, her demented citizen-sleuth colleague. Hilary Swank makes some guest appearances in the present day timeline. All we know so far is that she is already drenched in blood.\nYellowjackets premieres 14 February on Paramount Plus with Showtime in the US and Paramount Plus in the UK\nSeason three of Mike White's mordant social satire is set at the White Lotus resort in Thailand, and now there are snakes and monkeys along with the usual emotional upheaval. Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the spa manager at the Hawaii White Lotus in the first season, returns to take a training course at the new location. This time the guests include three old friends on a girls' trip, played by Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb, along with Jason Isaacs and Parker Posey as a married couple. Lalisa Manobal, better known as Lisa from the South Korean group Blackpink, plays Mook, a health and wellness counsellor at the resort, where health and wellness are undoubtedly in short supply.\u00a0\nThe White Lotus premieres 16 February on HBO and Max in the US and 17 February on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK\nThis political thriller starring Robert De Niro is intriguing and timely. When a cyberattack hits the US, causing devastation and deaths, former president George Mullen (De Niro) is called in to head a commission investigating the source, working against a barrage of problems and forces: big tech, Wall Street, rival political factions and a world of disinformation. Connie Britton plays Mullen's former chief of staff and Jesse Plemons is a former aide with political ambitions of his own. Joan Allen plays Mullen's wife, and Lizzy Caplan their daughter, a member of Congress. The plot deals with the slippery nature of truth itself. \"That's the spine of my character in the show,\" De Niro has said. \"Don't dodge anything. Don't play games. Be honest about what's going on so that the public knows what's going on.\" Angela Bassett plays the US president in casting that would have landed very differently if the US election had gone another way.\nZero Day premieres 20 February on Netflix internationally\nIn this animated family series from Pixar, eight members of a middle-school co-ed softball team, the Portland Pickles, are preparing for a championship game, with Will Forte as the voice of Coach Dan. Each episode focuses on a different character, from the school-age players to parents and coaches, and looks at their individual hopes, fears and insecurities, in a show whose message is to consider other people's points of view. There was recently a flutter of attention to the series for an extraneous reason, though, after word emerged that lines of dialogue identifying one character as transgender had been cut. Chanel Stewart, the 18-year-old trans actress who voices that character, told Deadline she was \"very disheartened\", and that \"I was excited to share my journey to help empower other trans youth\". In a statement, Disney said, \"When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we realize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.\"\nWin or Lose premieres 19 February on Disney+\nSteven Knight, the creator of Peaky Blinders, is right in his wheelhouse with another period piece about a criminal gang inspired by real-life stories, this time set in Victorian London and the world of illegal bare-knuckle boxing. Hezekiah (Malachi Kirby of Small Axe) and his friend Alec (Francis Lovehall, also of Small Axe) are Jamaicans who have come to London and who try to seek their fortunes as boxers. Hezekiah finds himself taken up and exploited by Mary Carr, the leader of the all-female band of robbers known as The Forty Elephants. Erin Doherty, who played Princess Anne as a young woman in The Crown, is far from that role as Carr. Stephen Graham stars as a boxer named Sugar Goodman, determined to defend his turf from the upstart Hezekiah. The stalwart Graham has played plenty of gritty characters, in Peaky Blinders and recently in Blitz, but had to bulk up for this role. \"Five meals a day, loads of protein, ice baths, I became like a proper athlete,\" he told Empire.\nA Thousand Blows premieres 21 February on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\nDavid Attenborough's nature documentaries have proven there is an apparently bottomless appetite for the genre. This variation stands apart because it has Tom Hanks narrating, with a sense of wonder. The series is an ambitious 10-part look at the Americas, with each episode focusing on a different area, ranging from Canada to Patagonia, the Atlantic coast to the Amazon. The production was epic, with 180 expeditions that took five years, making it what is likely the most expensive non-fiction show Universal Studios has ever done. Universal co-produced the show with the BBC, which also produces the Attenborough series. The music is composed by Oscar-winner Hans Zimmer, whose movie scores include Gladiator and Dune. But the soundtrack here also includes animal sounds, waves, and Hanks luring viewers in by saying, \"A wandering salamander. To find a mate he sets out on an extraordinary journey.\"\nThe Americas premieres 23 February on NBC in the US and in 2025 on BBC One in the UK\nAs Taylor Sheridan's prequel to his mega-hit series Yellowstone returns, the presence of either Harrison Ford or Helen Mirren might be enough to make you want to watch, and despite the near-death of Ford's character in season one, this series still has both. They are back as Jacob and Cara Dutton, who are enduring an especially hard winter on that familiar Montana ranch, not to mention the threat from an evil land-baron played by Timothy Dalton. Meanwhile, their nephew Spencer (Brandon Sklenar), is heading back from his African safari to help out, and Spencer's wife, Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer), an aristocrat from the UK, is trying to get across the Atlantic to her new home on the range (culture shock awaits). Ford growls in the teaser trailer, \"This ranch is under attack. Our whole way of life is under attack,\" which is pretty much an all-purpose Dutton line, available to use in any Yellowstone iteration.\n1923 premieres 23 February in the US and 24 February in the UK on Paramount+\nSuits, which ran on cable channel USA Network from 2011 to 2019, turned out to be an ideal show to binge. When the series about a firm of high-powered New York lawyers landed on Netflix, it became one of the most streamed series of 2023. We may never know how much that had to do with one of its stars being Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex. We do know that she is not in this spinoff set on the opposite coast. Neither is the rest of that cast (so far), with the exception of some guest appearances by Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter. The main character now is Ted Black (Stephen Amell), a former federal prosecutor in New York now running a powerful Los Angeles firm specialising in criminal and entertainment law. Aaron Korsh, the creator of Suits, also created the LA version. At first it was a different series, about Hollywood agents, which NBC passed on. He reconfigured that idea to exist in the same universe as Suits, and here we are.\nSuits LA premieres 23 February on NBC in the US\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US in a major expansion of existing trade barriers. \nThe tariffs, which will increase the costs of importing the metals into the US, come despite warnings of retaliation from some political leaders in Canada - America's biggest supplier of the metals - as well as other countries. \nUS businesses dependent on the imports have also raised concerns, but Trump has said his plans will boost domestic production.\nHe warned there would be no exceptions, saying he was \"simplifying\" the rules, which are set to come into effect on 12 March.\n\"This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,\" Trump said. \n\"Our nation requires steel and aluminium to be made in America, not in foreign lands,\" he added.\nWhen asked if tariffs could increase prices for consumers, the US president responded: \"Ultimately it will be cheaper.\" \n\"It's time for our great industries to come back to America... this is the first of many,\" he added, suggesting other tariffs could focus on pharmaceuticals and computer chips.\nThe US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers.\n\nCanada alone accounted for more than 50% of aluminium imported into the US last year. If the tariffs come into force, they are expected to have the most significant impact on Canada.\nLate on Monday, Canada's Minister of Innovation, Francois-Phillippe Champagne, said the tariffs were \"totally unjustified\". \n\"Canadian steel and aluminium support key industries in the US from defence, shipbuilding, energy to automotive,\" Champagne said. \"This is making North America more competitive and secure.\"  \nThe lobby group for Canadian steel makers called on the Canadian government to retaliate against the US \"immediately\", while Kody Blois, a leading MP from Canada's governing Liberal Party, said his country was looking for ways to reduce its trade relationship with the US. \n\"This is completely upending what has been a very strong partnership,\" he told BBC Newshour ahead of the official order.\nMeanwhile, share prices of the major US steelmakers rose on Monday in anticipation of the order, with the price of Cleveland-Cliffs jumping nearly 20%. Prices for steel and aluminium also jumped, while the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell.\nThe response in much of the rest of the market was muted, reflecting questions about how serious Trump is about his plans, given his track record of postponing tariffs, or negotiating exemptions to the rules.\n\"The market I think is beginning to wonder, to what degree is this a negotiation tactic by Trump or to what degree is he really willing to push these tariffs through?\" said Jane Foley from Rabobank.\nIn 2018, during his first term, Trump announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 15% on aluminium, but eventually negotiated carve-outs for many countries including Australia, Canada and Mexico.\n\"This is sort of a replay of 2018,\" said Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. \n\"The biggest question is the uncertainty over whether this is a bargaining tactic or whether he just doesn't want to talk with other countries and really wants to help out the steel industry in that way.\"\nLast week, Trump ordered import duties of 25% on all Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay that plan for 30 days. He also brought in new US levies of 10% on all Chinese goods coming into the US, prompting retaliation from China.\nA tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter a country, proportional to the value of the import.\nThe prospect of higher tariffs being introduced on imports to the US has been concerning many world leaders because it will make it more expensive for companies to sell goods in the world's largest economy.\nThe taxes are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.\nBut there are also concerns about the effect in the US, where many manufacturers inside the US use steel and aluminium in their products and now face the likelihood of added costs.\nIndustry groups from construction to can-makers warned about the hit.\nIn Trump's first term, the tariffs, despite many exemptions, raised the average price of steel and aluminium in the US by 2.4% and 1.6% respectively, according to the US International Trade Commission.\nStephen Moore, who advised Trump's campaign on economic issues in 2016 and is currently a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, said he did not think tariffs on steel and aluminium were effective way to create jobs, noting the experience of the first term. \nHe said while Trump was \"deadly serious\" about trade, he thought the plan was \"about getting the rest of the world's attention\".\n\"Just about everything Donald Trump does in Washington is a negotiating tactic,\" he said.\n\nTrump officials said the latest moves were aimed at stopping countries such as China and Russia from avoiding tariffs by routing low-cost products through other countries. \nThe US president said he was introducing new standards that require steel to be \"melted and poured\" and aluminium to be \"smelted and cast\" in North America. \nNick Iacovella, a spokesman for Coalition for a Prosperous America, which represents steel-makers and supports the tariffs, said his group is most concerned about a surge of steel imports from Mexico, above levels agreed in 2019.\nBut he noted that Canada sends far more goods to the US than it imports - a trade deficit that has been a key issue for Trump. \n\"There are still imbalances with the Canadian and United States trading relationship that should be addressed,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I don't think they're planning to take a one-size-fits-all hammer approach to this, but I think early on, in the beginning at least right now, I do think what the president is saying ... [is] both of those countries [Canada and Mexico] are abusing their relationship with the US and we're going to do something about it.\"",

Then he received surely the best advice he's ever had: \"Why don't you play a sport that appreciates your size?\"\nAt 6ft 8in and 365lb (166kg), that sport was American football and he joined the NFL's fledgling International Player Pathway programme in 2018.\nFormer English rugby player Christian Scotland-Williamson was also on that year's intake for the intensive 10-week training programme.\n\"His agility and speed for a person of his size, who hadn't grown into his full frame yet, it was so impressive,\" he said.\nHurts wins MVP as Eagles dominate Chiefs to win Super Bowl - as it happened\nEagles outclass Chiefs to win Super Bowl - in pictures\nThe IPP is designed to prepare NFL hopefuls for a shot at being selected in the NFL draft, giving them a crash course in American football and a platform to showcase their skills to NFL scouts.\nWord spread to Eagles executive Howie Roseman, who convinced Jeff Stoutland, Philly's offensive line coach and run game coordinator, to cancel a golf trip to go check him out.\n\"I didn't know want to expect,\" Stoutland told BBC Sport. \"I was told he was a rugby player, so I was like 'what am I doing'.\n\"It was the greatest decision I ever made \u2013 other than marrying my wife.\n\"I put on these drills and all of a sudden, this giant guy was just flying through the cones.\n\"I was like 'God', but I didn't show that expression at the time because there was another team there and I didn't want them to see my passion for him, I wanted to downplay it.\n\"And boy oh boy, I got out of that workout and called Howie and said 'let me get my hands on this guy'.\"\nA few weeks later, Scotland-Williamson attended the 2018 draft with Mailata. He was so convinced that Mailata's name would be called that he bought him a new outfit so he'd look good on TV.\nThe Eagles selected Mailata, who was aged 20, with the 233rd pick.\nThis video can not be played\nPhiladelphia Eagles destroy Kansas City Chiefs to win Super Bowl\nMailata spent two seasons on Philadelphia's practice squad, continuing his development.\n\"It was a grind for a few years,\" said Stoutland. \"Then all of a sudden one day, I mean it, the light came on and he became confident in his knowledge. Every year he just went to a new level.\"\nMailata played his first game in 2020 and has become one of the NFL's best offensive tackles, helping the Eagles reach the Super Bowl in 2023, where they were beaten by the Chiefs.\nLast year he signed a three-year contract extension worth $66m (\u00a353.3m) and is a key part of what was the biggest offensive line in Super Bowl history.\nAs an offensive tackle, he blocks the opposition's defensive line to protect quarterback Jalen Hurts, who was Sunday's Most Valuable Player, and open gaps for Saquon Barkley to run through.\nThe Eagles running back got enough yards on Sunday to set the all-time record for rushing yards in a season, including the play-offs, at 2,504.\n\"Saquon always says that he can't be great without the greatness of others,\" said Mailata after Sunday's game.\n\"When I hear that I'm like 'you know what, maybe it is me and not all Saquon, maybe there's just a small chance'.\"\nLive primetime games feature player introductions and they state which college they played at. Since Mailata did not follow the traditional path to the NFL, he says 'Stoutland University'.\nAnd Stoutland believes that Mailata, 27, can get even better, adding \"I don't think there's a top to this.\n\"Most players you coach, they've played through high school and college, so when they get to this level they're done, they're tapped out. But not him.\"\nAsked if he can believe how far he's come, Stoutland replied: \"It's the greatest story in football, I mean it.\"\nRugby players who tried to crack the NFL\nBest free agent ever? The story behind Barkley's stunning season\nCurrent Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Aden Durde and BBC Sport columnist Phoebe Schecter were on the IPP coaching staff in 2018.\nDurde said that much of Mailata's success is down to \"the way he's held himself in all these different environments\" and that \"he's a loud, fun character that's just got a heart of gold\".\nSchecter and Scotland-Williamson, who was a groomsman at Mailata's wedding in 2023, remember that he was always singing. He's since appeared on The Masked Singer and he remains that fun-loving guy.\nNow he can call himself a Super Bowl champion too. \"That sounds crazy,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I cannot believe I'm here.\n\"The only thing I was thinking was how long the journey was and how it took everyone to get here.\n\"It's funny how life works, my coach is tough and hard on me. I can only relate my success to how he coaches.\"\nAs the only rugby player who has so far made a successful switch to the NFL, he will now be a poster boy for other international players hoping to make it the transition.\n\"Just give it a go,\" he told them. \"You can do anything you want if you have belief in yourself and someone who believes in you.\"\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",
