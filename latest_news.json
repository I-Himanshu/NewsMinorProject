Hojlund is getting no help. He's having to try to hold the ball and use his body. He is making runs and is willing but is a little isolated. \n\"Not just Hojlund but Joshua Zirkzee has given up the ball too many times. There is not enough creativity and they are not holding up the ball for the midfielders and defenders to support them, so it's a bit of both.\"\nRooney calls Amorim 'naive' for saying Man Utd want Premier League title\nMatch of the Day 2: Deeney feels sorry for Hojlund\nThis video can not be played\n'I feel sorry for Rasmus Hojlund' - Troy Deeney\nHojlund had to wait until 26 December for his first Premier League goal last term. \nBut that prompted a purple patch of eight goals in eight games, with an  injury-interrupted first season at the club ending with 16 goals in 43 matches.\nHowever, he has only managed seven in 35 fixtures in all competitions this term and  that drop-off appears no surprise given he has averaged 1.5 shots per game over the course of the season while making just 3.5 touches on average in an opponent's penalty area.\nGarnacho (8.4), Diallo (7.3), Rashford (5.1) and Zirkzee (4.7) have all had more touches in the opposition box than the Dane. \nThat same quartet plus Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro also average more shots on goal than Hojlund, who registered 12 goals in 21 appearances for Sturm Graz and another 10 in 34 games in Italy.\nThose figures also look woefully low when you consider that Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz had 16 touches between them in the Manchester City penalty area in their Premier League victory just over a week ago.\nObi also managed six against Fulham in six minutes less and another cause for concern is that Hojlund's numbers have dropped since 19 December to 1.3 and 3.1. \nChris Sutton, who won the Golden Boot as joint-top Premier League goalscorer when he was with Blackburn in 1997-98 can relate to Hojlund's experience, having endured a miserable spell when at Chelsea where he went 21 games without a goal.\n\"The first thing I consider when any striker is being criticised is whether he is getting loads of chances? I'm not so sure Hojlund is,\" Sutton told BBC Sport.\n\"He is suffering, as a lot of strikers do, from that chronic lack of confidence which leads to a lack of belief and hesitancy. When strikers go on runs like the one he is on, it plays on your mind. It is probably affecting all his game, not just in front of goal, and the longer it goes on the worse it gets.\n\"Is the effort there? Yes, absolutely. Could he be doing better? Of course he could be but you could say that about virtually every Manchester United player.  \n\"You have to remember that United are not just under-performing a little bit, they are miles off it. There is an argument that, under Ruben Amorim, they have got worse than they were under Erik ten Hag.\n\"His issue at United is that, as well as trying to find some form, all strikers are reliant on service and he is not getting much.\"\nChief football news reporter, Simon Stone\nHojlund's valuation jumped up a huge amount in a very short space of time with moves from Copenhagen to Sturm Graz and then Atalanta.\nAnd even though his goal record was not exceptional, comparisons were drawn at the time with fellow Scandinavian forward Erling Haaland due to the size, strength and speed of both players. \nWhile United were convinced of his potential to develop into a top-class centre-forward, he has not fulfilled that and although he has shown glimpses of his finishing power, his confidence now looks shattered. \nHe never looked like getting in a position to score against Fulham and is not the sort of forward that drops deeper and gets involved in the build-up play. \nThe Dane was also not helped by Garnacho being named as a substitute given he seems to be the one player in the current squad that can stretch a game and provide some support.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs.

        "summary": "He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.In addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states. \"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.Kennedy stays mum on vaccinesBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination.

Next step is Champions League and now the focus is there.\"\nEven more exciting for Villa fans is the understanding he appears to be developing with Marcus Rashford, another winter window signing after the England forward joined on loan from Manchester United.\nHe provided the assist for Asensio's opener against Cardiff, meaning all three of his assists for Villa so far have been for goals scored by the Spanish midfielder.\n\"Marcus [Rashford] is a top player,\" Asensio added. \n\"We are together not so much but I know what he wants to do, where he passes and I am very happy to have Marcus and all of the team-mates.\"\nMarco Asensio has scored four goals in six games for Aston Villa\nAsensio was perhaps destined to be a footballer, with his father having named him after legendary Netherlands striker Marco van Basten.\nBut the 29-year-old has forged an impressive career in his own right. \nAfter starting out at Mallorca, he had a spell at Espanyol before joining Real Madrid, where he helped the Spanish giants with La Liga four times and the Champions League three times.\nIn total he won 17 trophies at Real, as many as a player considered one of the greatest in world football - Alfredo Di Stefano.\nAfter seven seasons at Real he made the move to French giants PSG, helping them to win a domestic treble last year.\nGiven the success he has enjoyed, joining a club not currently challenging for league titles no doubt raised an eyebrow.\nBut Unai Emery has been a long-time admirer of Asensio and played a key role in his signing.\n\"Unai has tried to get Asensio in at least three windows,\" Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.\n\"He has always said to Unai he wanted to work with him and develop with him.\"\nThe clincher for Emery appears to have been the promise of playing Asensio in the number 10 position.\n\"He hasn't played there since Mallorca,\" added Balague.  \n\"At Madrid he wasn't allowed, so that was the discussion he had with Unai. He was told number 10 and you can see the good consequences of it.\"\nAsensio is not the only player who is flourishing since moving to Aston Villa, with Rashford appearing to be putting behind him a difficult season at Manchester United with a strong start to life in the Midlands.\nRashford had been struggling for form at Old Trafford and found himself out of the picture under Ruben Amorim.\nBut the move to Villa and playing alongside Asensio appears to bringing him back to his best.\nSince his debut on 9 February, Rashford has created more chances in all competitions than any other Premier League player (13).\nAgainst Cardiff, Rashford created six chances for Aston Villa, equalling the most he ever created in any of his 426 matches for Manchester United (six vs Wigan in January 2024).\nHe has yet to score, although given his performances so far that will surely come sooner rather than later.\n\"Aston Villa have given him a lifeline,\" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on ITV Sport. \n\"It seems to have come to an end at Manchester United. He needed to rebuild his confidence, he is 27 and has to show he has a lot to give. Villa have given him a good opportunity.\n\"Things could be very exciting here at Aston Villa with this new exciting Aston Villa forward line.\"\nWith a Champions League last-16 game at Club Brugge up next, Emery believes Asensio and Rashford maintaining their form is key to Villa achieving their ambitions this season.\n\"We need [Asensio] and we need Rashford,\" he said.\n\"We need the players who joined in the last window. We need the players coming back from injury. Every player will be necessary for the matches in the next weeks and months.\n\"Now we focus on the Champions League.

        "article_text": "Southern California is frequently shaken by earthquakes. How they feel to people living in Los Angeles has a lot to do with the sediment-filled basin the city sits upon.\nHollywood stars were just starting to arrive at their afterparties following the Oscars when the ground suddenly jolted. There were a few screams and high-rise buildings reportedly wobbled.\u00a0\nThe magnitude 3.9 earthquake that hit North Hollywood on 2 March 2025 was the latest in a number of jolts to have hit the area. The earthquake was measured to have occurred at a depth of around 9 miles (15km), but was felt in parts of the city several miles away. Another much smaller\u00a0magnitude 1.3 earthquake was detected almost in the same location a few hours later. No damage to buildings was reported.\nIt wasn't a terribly unusual event, by California's standards. The state is the\u00a0second-most seismically active\u00a0in\u00a0the United States behind Alaska, with Southern California experiencing an\u00a0earthquake on average every three minutes. In the week leading up to the post-Oscars quake, 36 earthquakes occured in the LA area, with most being under magnitude 2.0.\u00a0While most are too small to be felt, around\u00a015-20 events exceed magnitude 4.0 each year.\nThe most recent occured a little over an hour after sunset on 6 August 2024, when a sparsely populated belt of farmland near Bakersfield, Southern California, was shaken from a restful evening. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake, followed by hundreds of smaller aftershocks, shuddered through the area as a fault near the southern end of the Central Valley ruptured \u2013 the largest earthquake to hit Southern California in three years. The epicenter was about 17 miles (27km) south of Bakersfield and people reported shaking nearly 90 miles (145km) away in portions of Los Angeles and as far away as San Diego. Then, a few days later, another jolt rattled the Los Angeles area due to a rupture on a small section of the dangerous Puente Hills fault system. The resulting magnitude 4.4 earthquake had its epicentre just four miles northeast of the city's downtown area.\nAlthough there was minimal damage caused by both quakes in August 2024 and the less severe shake in Hollywood in March 2025, they highlighted just how the geology under California's largest city can alter the effects of fault movements in the area. The relatively shallow depth of the 6 August earthquake appeared to create more intense or prolonged shaking in some parts of the city, while others felt almost nothing at all.\nThere are various reasons for why this might be \u2013 including what people were doing at the time of the earthquake \u2013 but the enormous five-mile-deep (8km), sediment-filled basin that LA is built upon plays a surprising role in the effects felt above ground.\nWhile the ground feels steadfast at the surface, deeply buried bedrock can resemble a shattered window pane. These cracks, or faults, are where earthquakes occur. Faults are put under tremendous stress by the slow and steady movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.\nIn California, the North American plate and the Pacific Plate are grinding past each other along the infamous San Andreas fault, averaging about 30-50 millimeters (1-2 inches) every year. The movement is anything but fluid. Cracked rocks are rough and wedge against each other, sometimes staying stuck for thousands of years. Over time, stress created by the slow marching tectonic plates builds up and when the fault reaches its stress limit, it \"slips\" and ruptures, causing an earthquake. \u00a0\nA rupture begins at one location and travels in one direction along the fault, stretching up to hundreds of kilometers. The longest rupture ever recorded was a 994 mile (1,600km) portion of a fault that caused the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and resulting tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. \"The farther it goes, the longer [the earthquake] lasts, and the more energy that's released. So the longer the fault, the bigger the earthquake,\" explains seismologist Lucy Jones, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology and former seismologist with the US Geological Survey.\nDuring an earthquake, the stored energy saved within the sticky fault is released suddenly. Seismic waves radiate out from the rupture like the ripples created by throwing a rock into a pond, spreading in all directions through the surrounding rock and earth.\u00a0\nThe magnitude of an earthquake tells scientists about the length of the ruptured fault as well as the duration of shaking, says Jones. But the intensity of an earthquake \u2013 the ground motions we feel at a location \u2013 is shaped by how close we are to the epicenter, which direction the fault ruptured, and the geological layers under our feet.\nLos Angeles is located south of a giant a bend in the San Andreas fault where the plate boundary clearly changes direction. \"If you see it from the air, it's amazing,\" says Jones. \"It's so bizarre \u2013 you can look down and see the fault valley and then it just turns.\"\nAround the turn, the region is chock full of faults. Over millions of years, the faults churned and pushed slabs of bedrock into multiple mountain ranges and deep basins. Gravity, water and wind act like sandpaper, wearing down the mountains, and carrying debris into the basins. Over time, the basins have been filled with sediment.\nThe bowl-shaped basin of rock under Los Angeles is up to five miles (8km) deep, filled with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay. The contrast between the hard rock and softer sediment are big factors that cause some seismic weirdness for cities like Los Angeles.\nDuring an earthquake, seismic waves are modulated by geology, says John Vidale, professor of seismology at University of Southern California. \"The primary factor is just how hard is the ground and how deep is the structure that has soft [material] near the surface,\" he says. Seismic waves will move faster in denser material like rock, versus softer and less dense sediment.\nAs seismic waves travel through the basin, their behaviour changes when they encounter the loose sediment. \"[The wave] is now having to travel at a much slower speed, but it still has to carry the same amount of energy per unit time,\" said Jones. As the wave slogs through the sediment, the amplitude, or wave height, gets bigger.\nPut another way, imagine the Los Angeles basin as a giant bowl of jelly \u2013 the dense rocky mountains and underlying rock make up the bowl, while the sediment fill is represented by the gelatinous mixture. \"If you shake the bottom [of the bowl] a little bit, the top flops back and forth quite a bit,\" says Vidale. And atop this quivering mass of jelly is the megacity of Los Angeles.\nThis means the amplitude of the waves within a basin can be significantly bigger than those moving through rock. In one study, researchers using earthquake measurements in the Los Angeles region from the 1992 Landers earthquake found that seismic waves inside the Los Angeles basin were three to four times larger than sites outside the basin.\nIn addition to amplification, seismic waves can also reverberate within a sediment-filled basin. Think back to that shaking bowl of jelly and how the flopping top bounces off the sides of the bowl. Scientists from the Statewide California Earthquake Center simulated earthquakes in the Los Angeles region and found that the basin can trap seismic wave energy in a similar way. This reverberation can mean shaking can often go on for longer than the duration of the fault rupture itself, increasing the hazard for the city built on top.\nAs if that wasn't enough for Los Angeles, the close proximity of the San Bernadino and San Gabriel Basins to the Los Angeles Basins can create a funneling effect, directing seismic waves towards Los Angeles.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Will we ever be able to predict earthquakes?\n\u2022\u00a0The animals that can predict disasters\n\u2022\u00a0How your mobile phone can detect earthquakes\nEven within a basin, there can be differences in how the sediment interacts with seismic waves. \"There's variability in the shaking\u2026 there's variations in the geology,\" says Vidale. Sediment in the upper 330ft (100m) of the basin tends to be looser and less dense than the deeper, compacted sediment below. Sediment changes can also happen quickly at the surface. \"Old stream channels, for example, can be filled with a kind of wet, soft material,\" Vidale says. \"So, if you happen to be in an old stream channel, you'll get hit a lot harder than somebody even a quarter mile away that's on firmer ground.\"\nEven those in the same house can have different experiences, especially if the earthquake is on the smaller side. \"I'm in Pasadena, on the sediment in the San Gabriel Valley,\" say Jones. Despite both being in the house, she and her husband had different experiences of the earthquake on 6 August 2024. \"I felt it, my husband didn't,\" she says.\nWhile the city of Los Angeles ticks a lot of seismic hazard boxes, it is not the only urban center that needs to worry. Throughout human history, people have tended to build cities on flat ground near water bodies.\nIt just so happens that these sites tend to form above geologic basins and sometimes near faults.\u00a0\nWhile the US has a few famous cities built on basins \u2013 Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City \u2013 there are many others around the world that experience amplified seismic waves due to where they are situated. After the European settlers drained Lake Texcoco in the 1500s, Mexico City was built on the flat, old lake bottom. In 1985 and 2017, the city experienced significant damage from earthquakes that shook the basin sediments.\nThe desert megacity of Tehran in Iran also sits atop a geologic basin filled with river sediments, and there is growing concern about the risk of a major earthquake in the area.\nUnderstanding the earthquake risk is the first step in bolstering protection for a city against significant shaking. Enacting robust building codes can be another way to protect people and infrastructure, but it often takes a major event for stricter regulations to be implemented. After the devastating earthquake in 1985, for example, Mexico City enacted stringent building codes, and retrofitted older buildings.\u00a0\n\"The very first earthquake codes [in California] went in after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake,\" adds Jones. At that time, schools were built out of firesafe, unreinforced brick. \"Seventy schools were completely destroyed \u2013 luckily, it was at six o'clock at night,\" says Jones. The horror of collapsing schools spurred regulation, but initial codes were meagre. \"They basically just said, 'don't build unreinforced masonry in California'. \u00a0That was sort of the first basic code.\"\nToday, assessing earthquake risks is a lot more nuanced.\nIn the US, a team of seismologists, geoscientists and geophysicists have created a seismic hazard map, showing the chances of a damaging earthquake shaking in the next 100 years. In their latest version of the report, the team found that that nearly 75% of the US could experience damaging shaking. To help policymakers and engineers, the team included information on the implications for building and structural designs.\nWhile building codes can protect lives, scientists like Jones want building codes to go further. Designing buildings so they can be more easily repaired rather than needing to be demolished would cost an extra 1% in the construction phase, Jones estimates. \"We're calling it 'functional recovery',\" she says.\n\"We are trying to say that 'just not killing you' is an insufficient standard. The reality is, if your building's badly damaged and now has to be torn down after the earthquake, you've hurt your tenants, you've hurt your neighbors, you've hurt the local economy.\"\nFortunately, the buildings of Los Angeles rode out the latest quakes to rattle Southern California pretty well. But at some point, the city won't be so lucky.\n* This article was originally published on 18 August 2024.

Washington state reported its first case in an infant over the weekend. \nDuring his first public appearance in the Oval Office last week, after the first measles death was announced, Kennedy told reporters the US has measles outbreaks \"every year\". \nBut in an essay published on Fox News on Sunday, he struck a different tone, calling the outbreak a \"top priority\". Kennedy encouraged parents to talk to their doctors about vaccinations against measles. He noted the vaccines \"not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons\". \nMeasles is a dangerous virus that can lead to a host of complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death. \nA large portion of the population - more than 90% - needs to be vaccinated to help protect those who cannot get the shot,  including pregnant people, children under one year and the immunocompromised.\nIn Gaines County in western Texas, where the measles outbreak began, as few as 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated against the virus. \nKennedy had yet to encourage people to get vaccinated, a move local health officials said was critical to help slow the spread of the virus. \n\"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers-that-be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine,\" Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official leading the response against measles, told the BBC last week, before Kennedy's op-ed. \nIn the past, Kennedy has repeated widely debunked claims about childhood vaccinations, though he changed course this year, saying during his confirmation hearing that he supported immunizations. \nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments has risen, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.",

To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.\nThese are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.\nThen there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.\n\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.\nNorth Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.\nSince then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.\nBut after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.\nLast Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.\nAmong them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.\nBen Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.\n\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"\nDespite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"\nOn his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.\nFor now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.\nSet up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.\nJoe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.\nJoe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.\n\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"\nBut according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.\nCovid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.\nIt is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.\nLocal guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.\nEven Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"\nThe regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.\n\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.\nOne of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.\nThey knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"\nSuch conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.\nMike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"\nFor Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"\nBut tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.\n\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.\nOne conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.\nTo fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".\n\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"\nTwo years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.\nBut now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.\nCorporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.\nThe moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.\nSince assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\nIn the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.\nAt first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".\nProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.\nUnder names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.\nAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.\nDEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.\nThe programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.\nBut almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".\nMore recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.\nThe roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".\nSocial media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.\nOne of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.\nAnother major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.\nThe ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.\nThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.\nMartin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.\nSurveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".\nMuch rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.\nSome research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.\nThis research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.\nThe problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.\nShe cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.\nBut Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.\nAnd when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.\nWhere studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.\nSupporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.\nLast autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year \u2013 43 \u2013 and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.\nColleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.\nBut the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.\nFor the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.\nBecause of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.\nBut another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.\nDartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.\nIt's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.\nMichelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"\nBut as to the question at the centre of her book \u2013 is DEI dead? \u2013 Jolivet says the answer is no.\nThe companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.\nShe gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"\nBut not everyone is reassured.\nBack in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.\nShe fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".\nShe says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\"\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "I was effectively homeless after getting sacked - Stoney\nCasey Stoney was only meant to be returning to England temporarily last June for a funeral when she found herself stuck in the country, along with her family, unable to go back to their home in California.\nUpon landing on British soil, the former England captain was informed by her agent that she had been sacked as head coach of NWSL club San Diego Wave.\n\"When I got fired, it terminated our visas with immediate effect whilst I was in the UK, pretty much rendering me and my partner homeless, with three children,\" she tells BBC Sport.\nAs she had been outside of the US when her sacking happened and her visa was dependent on her work, she had no way of returning without finding another sponsor.\nThat led to a turbulent few months for the 42-year-old, who was left questioning whether she even wanted to keep working in football.\nNow the former Manchester United boss is taking on international management for the first time in her new role as Canada coach, and is finally back to doing what she loves - getting out on the training pitch and working with her players.\nFormer England defender Casey Stoney (right) joined newly formed club San Diego Wave in June 2021\nStoney, who won 130 caps for England and captained Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, had been in charge of San Diego Wave for nearly three years after resigning as Manchester United manager in 2021.\nThe NWSL club were a new franchise when she became head coach and she led them to third place and then top spot during the first two seasons.\nThey twice reached the semi-finals of the end-of-season play-offs, which crowns the league's champions, but her third season had not continued on the same trajectory with just three wins after 14 games.\nShe saw the job as a long-term project. She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California.\n\"It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren't even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,\" she says.\n\"If I'm honest, I didn't think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn't even anything major.\n\"So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family.\n\"I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn't have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family.\"\nThe day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself.\nIt was a period she describes as \"one of the hardest times in my life\".\nShe says: \"It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game.\n\"I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out.\n\"My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego.\"\nCasey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018\nIt took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney's consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and \"our lives\". They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim.\n\"[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time.\"\nShe also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities.\n\"It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn't have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds.\"\nThe ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women's Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time.\nBut then along came the Canada job.\nAt first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she \"loves\", which is working with players day to day.\nYet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months.\n\"I really liked that it was extensive,\" she says. \"It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me.\"\nThat included speaking to the manager of the men's team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game.\nAnd she was impressed \u2013 by the organisation's leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role.\n\"When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn't have to move,\" she said.\n\"That's been really, really beneficial for us as a family. I don't think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you're in a privileged position, but it's the impact on your family it has.\n\"I had young children that just didn't understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I'd contributed to that, which was difficult.\n\"There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn't have a job.

        "article_text": "The UK has been one of the most popular destinations for international students in recent years - but is its appeal starting to fade?\nHome Office figures show UK sponsored study visas dropped by 31% \u2013 from 600,024 in 2023 to 415,103 in 2024 - and with this, money many university cities rely on.\nUniversities UK, which represents 141 institutions, says measures to reduce net migration have \"created significant uncertainty around the UK's post-study work offer\".\nThe government says international students \"will always be welcome but the net migration levels seen in recent years have been completely unacceptable, and we have committed to reducing those numbers substantially\".\nCoventry in the West Midlands is particularly dependent on the international student economy. \nIn 2022-23, of universities with at least 10,000 students, Coventry University had the second highest percentage of international students in England outside London.\nThere were 16,285 non-UK students out of a total of 35,405, according to the most recent figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).\nJingwen Yuan, 30, spent seven years as a construction project manager in her native China, where she oversaw building projects that housed more people than are found in some UK cities. \nThe Coventry University alumnus has a masters degree in advanced engineering management and paid \u00a33,000 to stay in the UK on a graduate visa while looking for work - but has been unable to find a job.\n\"All of my bachelor degrees classmates from home have gone back to China,\" she says.\n\"My friend got \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000 from our government if she came back. And for us, if we choose to stay, we need to pay \u00a33,000 to the UK government. Can you see the difference?\"\n\"The one thing stopping more students coming here is recent changes in the visa,\" says Mohammed Abdullah Sayyed, 21, from India. \nStudent visa restrictions took effect in January 2024, meaning postgraduates lost the right to bring dependant family members to the UK and new students were prevented from switching to a work visa before the end of their courses.\nThere was an 85% drop in the number of sponsored study visas for dependants, from 143,276 in 2023 to 21,978 in 2024.\nMohammed says another factor is international students pay more than UK ones.\nCoventry University says tuition fees can vary depending on the course - but as of September 2024, most courses cost approximately \u00a316,800 \u2013 \u00a320,050 per year for international students. \nThat's compared to \u00a39,250 for domestic students, which will rise to \u00a39,535 in September.\nCoventry University says Brexit has had \"a profound impact\" on UK universities' ability to attract EU students. \nThe House of Commons Library states the number of EU students fell sharply after changes to visa requirements and funding rules in 2021-22. \nSince August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans.\nLaura Alonso is studying international relations at Coventry University. \nThe 21-year-old from Spain says: \"There's a lot of international people and international students, especially in Coventry, so you always feel welcome\".\nBut she believes the UK's withdrawal from the Erasmus+ programme put lots of Spanish students off studying there. \nThe Turing Scheme, which replaced it, funds UK participants to study or work abroad - but does not fund international students coming to the UK. \nWhilst the number of international visas has fallen by almost a third, the number of international students applying to study in the UK via The University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has increased.\nUCAS saw a 2.7% rise in international undergraduate applicants between 2024 and 2025\nHowever this does not represent the full picture, as UCAS figures do not account for students applying directly through colleges and universities, or postgraduate courses.\nThe overall fall in international students is impacting Coventry University's finances. It recently put hundreds of staff at risk of redundancy.\nSo it is little surprise the change is also being felt in the city's wider economy.\nCoventry University's analysis of Higher Education Policy Institute and Kaplan International's figures suggests international students generate about \u00a3651m a year for the city's economy.\nOne sign of a drop in overseas students is that several purpose-built student accommodation blocks are the subject of change-of-use planning proposals to convert them for residential use.\nThe volume of student accommodation being approved has attracted debate, with some residents objecting to planning applications. \nEstate agents report landlords selling up due to falling international student numbers.\n\nCoventry University says it is proud to widen accessibility to education: \"It would be odd to constrain our mission and values within national borders.\n\"Our long-term strategy of diversifying income to help counter the fact UK tuition fees have been frozen for several years has been successful and remains the right thing to do.\n\"The sustained growth in student numbers over a number of years allowed us to create many jobs and increased economic and social benefits. We are now having to rebalance the organisation based on changes outside of our control.\"\nThe government says its Immigration White Paper will set out \"a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system, linking immigration, skills and visa systems to grow our domestic workforce, end reliance on overseas labour and boost economic growth.\"\nVivienne Stern, CEO of Universities UK, says funding issues mean universities are reducing students' options - and the drop in international students is hurting communities.\n\"There are people in all sorts of walks of life who benefit from the fact that universities bring students in who spend money in shops and cafes - local businesses, getting their hair cut, taking taxis. \n\"It really contributes to economies right across the UK, and I think that's really special.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry.",

The winning runs were hit after the sun had set and the locals had broken their Ramadan fast.\nAt one point on Saturday, there were fears the floodlights would not be needed.\n\"As a whole group, not just batters, we're not getting the results and that does take away your confidence,\" captain Jos Buttler said.\n\"It's time for everyone to get away, get a change of scenery and work hard wherever cricket takes you next.\"\nButtler knows this feeling because the seven-wicket defeat by South Africa was English white-ball cricket going full circle.\nBack in 2015, he was part of the side also dismissed cheaply before their opponents cantered home - New Zealand the victors on that occasion in Wellington.\nThat day England's players sat in silence in a shell-shocked dressing room as the baying crowd shook the foundations of the stadium above them.\nThis was a Champions Trophy dead rubber rather than a live World Cup match and there were no such problems with the crowd.\nStill, it must be the spark of a rebuild, like the Cake Tin defeat was to Eoin Morgan.\nThis has to be England's latest visit to rock bottom.\nMcCullum does not rule out making outsider captain\nEngland's Champions Trophy ends in sorry defeat\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nThe quirk is that England's destroyer 10 years ago will be the one to plot the path ahead to ultimately regain the world titles lost. \n\"These guys are too hard on themselves,\" said their opponent turned coach Brendon McCullum.\n\"They've got immense talent, they are desperate to want to perform. That's actually stymying the ability of us to get the performance we want. They care too much.\"\nExpect hard work but no change in England's rhetoric.\nAnd while there is some merit in McCullum words - relaxing his players and removing the fear of failure is what has helped him turn around the fortunes of the Test side alongside Ben Stokes - it was not the reason Phil Salt and Jamie Smith gave away their wickets or Liam Livingstone looked a novice when faced with spinner Keshav Maharaj.\nAttacking shots are causing England's downfall, not tentative prods. There is more at play here - muddled minds aplenty.\nThis video can not be played\nJansen's three wickets against England\nMcCullum finds himself in a tricky spot.\nMorgan's rebuild was remarkable, it progressed all the way to Lord's in 2019, but it began at a distinct path, with England playing dull, dated cricket.\nThe requirements were clear - pick younger, more ambitious players available in county cricket but not selected. The present-day route is far less obvious.\nInitially, McCullum must decide if these are good players underperforming.\nDebate can be had over Liam Dawson, who should have been in Pakistan as an all-rounder and second spin option, but there are few other glaring omissions. \nWould the 35-year-old left-arm spinner have made this side semi-finalists? You are always a better player when away from the spotlight.\nLivingstone looks to be fighting for his ODI future and Salt is under pressure after a tournament in which he has averaged 10, but the rest of the top seven - Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler and, to a lesser extent given his poor showing here, Smith - still looks a fearsome line-up on paper.\nIn contrast, the bowling needs work and McCullum hinted at regrets over the limited, pace-heavy approach employed in Pakistan.\n\"Obviously, our gameplan was to try and bring fast bowling over here, try to stock our batting and give ourselves that sort of conviction and that method,\" McCullum said.\n\"We may not have got it totally right this time but you've got to have conviction in something.\"\nHis side's new-ball economy rate is currently the most expensive in the world, their powerplay threat only better than Zimbabwe, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates and their middle-over record in Pakistan their worst at a major tournament.\nIt leaves plenty of room for improvement.\nBut with Jofra Archer on a three-year contract and Mark Wood lauded wholesale change does not look likely.\nHampshire quick Sonny Baker - the 21-year-old who impressed for the Lions this winter - is one on the radar, while there is still hope Josh Hull could be the left-armer England so desperately require, but otherwise England will rebuild with the players seen here, meaning other gains will have to be made.\nIt is three months and 23 days since England lined up with a top seven of Salt, Will Jacks, Jordan Cox, Bethell, Livingstone, Sam Curran and Dan Mousely. Greater consistency in selection would be a good place to start.\nThat will be aided by the fact McCullum is now in charge of both red and white-ball teams, meaning there is no longer a tussle between two coaches with two different priorities.\nDifficulties will still appear with the New Zealander keen to promote multi-format regulars rather than white-ball specialists, which will leave a winter featuring an Ashes series flanked by white-ball trips to New Zealand and Sri Lanka to be balanced with great care.\nMcCullum is now England's man for all seasons, who has sparked a rebuild twice before - first in Wellington and then with the Test side.\nHis third act may be his most difficult.",

        "article_text": "YouTube started out as an off-beat video sharing site. But at its 20th anniversary, the platform's content has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with each other.\nIn 2006, Time Magazine named its annual Person of the Year: you. \"Yes you,\" the magazine read. \"You control the Information Age. Welcome to your world.\" Its cover featured a mirror to reflect reader's image \u2013 emblazoned on a computer screen tuned to a site modelled after YouTube. It was just a year after YouTube's launch, but already, it had shifted our understanding of the role we would play in the coming era.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. It's gone from a novel tool to an unshakable pillar of technological infrastructure. Some 2.5 billion people log on every month. The company says people who watch YouTube on their TVs consume a billion hours of video a day, to say nothing of time spent on the app and website. But as much as YouTube changed how we use the internet, it's had an equally significant impact on our offline lives.\n\"Not long ago virtually no one took YouTube that seriously,\" journalist Mark Bergen writes in his book Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"But in so many ways, YouTube had set the stage for modern social media, making decisions throughout its history that shaped how attention, money, ideology, and everything else worked online.\"\nYouTube videos have occupied a massive share of our collective consciousness, dictating what brings us together, what drives us apart, what makes us laugh, cry and cringe. \"All the dynamics of social media \u2013 of attention, fame, disrupting old school media \u2013 have mostly grown because of the financial model YouTube built,\" Bergen tells the BBC. Human nature itself has shifted in the last 20 years, and as seen in these five videos, YouTube would become a nexus point for the way we see ourselves and each other.\nLong before the video stitching on TikTok or remixing on Instagram reels, there was Canon Rock, uploaded just 10 months after YouTube's founding. South Korean musician Jeong-Hyun Lim, known online as funtwo, sits in his bedroom with an electric guitar, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap and pixelated footage. A backing track plays the chords to Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D, and Lim joins in, his guitar work subdued in line with the 300-year-old piece. But Lim's playing \u00a0grows more intricate until, about 40 seconds in, he launches into a blazing solo, fingers gliding across the fretboard.\nThe reaction was explosive. As the video racked up hits, around 900 users sent direct video responses to Canon Rock \u2013 big numbers at a time when uploading videos meant plugging in a digital camera \u2013 and thousands more posted their own covers of the song. In 2007, YouTube user Impeto uploaded a compilation of dozens of Canon Rock videos edited into one continuous track, almost as though the whole internet was playing along together. Deft musicianship wasn't new to the web, but the user participation was.\nCanon Rock created a \"reciprocity between artists\" that opened the door for people to see each other as creative partners, says Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University in the US. By democratising the creative process, YouTube created a melting pot for different communities with different interests and skills to make the internet their own.\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our story on the YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know.\nIt helped inspire a new era of online collaboration, according to Jean Burgess, a digital media professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Videos like funtwo's weren't just a performance, Burgess says, they were an invitation, a \"showcasing of skill and the setting of standards for other players in the 'game' to attain or beat\".\nToday's video platforms bombard us with marketing partnerships and endless threads of political discourse. But the musicians behind Canon Rock represented a simpler time, where collaboration was not an economic or ideological proposition, but instead a space where online bedroom dwellers were learning to see each other as members of a global community, a project they were all embarking on together.\nEarly YouTube audiences will probably be familiar with the saga of Bree, better known by the username lonelygirl15. Her story began as a homeschooled girl posting simple videos about her daily life. But things took a bizarre turn when Bree discovered her family was involved with a strange religious cult. Over the weeks and months, the narrative grew more convoluted; Bree ultimately went on the run, investigating secret codes, eluding religious acolytes and fighting a sinister organisation.\nIt was all fiction, of course. But lonelygirl15's start was so mundane that many didn't question the story until the drama was too fantastic to ignore. \"Bree\" had an enigmatic realness \u2013 she was actively connecting with fans on MySpace and corresponding with journalists, and even the New York Times was still asking whether the series was truth or a hoax before the final episode. It sparked ferocious debate in online forums, with viewers picking apart everything from her narrative to the quality of her video production.\n\"[Lonelygirl15] seemed to captivate so many, drawing people who maybe didn\u2019t know what YouTube really was into the fold,\" says Duffy. \"The authenticity, the relatability, the vulnerability, the expressive sharing.\"\nBeyond satire, the series was a pointed effort to use the tropes and norms of social media to misguide the audience. It marked a major development on the internet, where some realised for the first time just how blurry the lines between fact and fiction had become, Duffy says.\nLonelygirl15 was a sea change for many users' relationships to each other, and it forced some people to examine the identities that they themselves were creating online, Bergen says. \"In some ways, the lonelygirl15 series was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"It was a clever commentary about the fact that authenticity doesn't really exist online \u2013 you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one.\"\nIt raised questions about discerning truth on the web, and helped establish a new order where every post, no matter how innocuous, is subject to interrogation and distrust.\nIt's 2011. A young man sits in front of a map of the world. His hands and voice are shaky as he calls his father on the phone. The man is Randy Phillips, an airman in the US Air Force, and he is filming himself telling his dad that he is gay.\nPhillips ran a channel called \"AreYouSurprised\" detailing his life under the US's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy. In his previous videos, Phillips positioned the camera to keep his face just out of view, but hours after the 16-year policy was repealed, he was on full display. Phillips wasn't the only one. His post was an early example of the \"coming out\" video, a YouTube genre that became more and more influential as time went on.\n\"Watching real LGBTQ+ people share their own coming out journeys across platforms like YouTube definitely provided an opportunity for queer and transgender people all over the world to realise they were not alone,\" says Zach Eisenstein, director of communications at The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\u00a0\"When YouTube was just starting up, I was a teenager figuring out my own identity,\" he says. \"It helped me exponentially as I navigated my own coming out journey.\"\nThe offline world was in the throes of change. It would be four years until the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, but following a global economic recession that highlighted growing inequality and shifting political climates, social attitudes were becoming more inclusive.\nTyler Oakley, one of the first major openly gay personalities on the platform, launched the \"Coming Out\" challenge in 2011, encouraging his audience and fellow creators to proudly share their sexual orientations and experiences. YouTubers like Hannah Hart, Ingrid Nilsen and singer Troye Sivan garnered a collective 2.8 million views on their coming out videos. Olympic diver Tom Daley came out in a 2013 video, receiving support from his fans and fellow athletes.\n\"People find creators that speak to them, and very often watch them and get to know them and trust them and are influenced by them in a way that no other platform touches,\" says Ben Relles, former head of comedy at YouTube and cofounder of the YouTube channel Barely Political. The way we present ourselves differs between coworkers, family, friends and strangers, but YouTube circumvented those social links. LGBTQ+ creators leveraged the relationships \u00a0with their audiences to make it plain that people with different sexual identities did not just exist, they were no different than every other person.\n\"Through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the internet, social media has given people a unique ability to find safe and welcoming online communities \u2013 especially when they don\u2019t feel accepted in their in-person ones,\" Eisenstein says.\n\"This is for my 12-year-old self,\" begins Australian YouTuber Essena O'Neill in what she called her last ever YouTube video in 2015. Over the next 17 minutes, O'Neill broke down her decision to quit all social media and made a passionate plea to her followers to do the same. O'Neill's story took aim at the \"contrived\" reality of video and social media production, and its harmful effects on mental health. It was a sign of things to come.\n\"Running a channel is very much like running a treadmill,\" says Matt Koval, a filmmaker and YouTube's former head creator liaison. \"If you stop, if you get off the treadmill for a long period of time, your viewers are going to move on and start watching other people just by nature, and it can be difficult to come back.\" And many creators, even as far back as YouTube's early days, never did.\nQuitting videos have become a social media subgenre unto themselves in the past decade \u2013 people in the public eye realising that they've taken on too much, or that they need a break. But O'Neill's departure helped spark a broader conversation.\n\"People are so dismissive of influencers and creators,\" says Duffy. \"What creative workers experience really presages wider trends in the economy.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\nIt wasn't just creators facing burnout online. In the early days, social media was sold as utopian opportunity, a place where people would come together to share ideas beyond the constraints of traditional gatekeepers. But as time went by, a new discussion emerged about social media's potentially addictive qualities and negative effects on our time, attention and mental health.\nThanks in part to a push from creators like O'Neill, who offered their own experience as a model, conversations about our own relationships to the internet began to shift. Ten years later, we've reached the point the point that officials describe social media as a full on public health crisis \u2013 but that shift in thinking hasn't been enough to keep people off the internet. Social media usage on YouTube and elsewhere is higher than ever, and these days, O'Neill herself is back online.\nA spokesperson for Google, YouTube's parent company, says the platform works hard to ensure it's providing a healthy and fulfilling network, both for creators and users who just come to watch. \"Each YouTube creator has a different definition of success, and we have support mechanisms in place and continue to build a community that allows creators to thrive based on their individual needs and business aspirations,\" the spokesperson says. \"We want creators to make their videos in a healthy, sustainable way, and creating engaging content should always take priority over producing a certain quantity of videos.\" YouTube has invested in a number of efforts to promote mental health among its users and across the globe.\nMore people than ever were watching YouTube videos in the 2010s, with the site averaging one billion users a month by 2013, according to the company. But as YouTubers became more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, some of those feelings turned towards the platform itself.\nFor years, YouTube released an annual recap video looking back at the service's biggest cultural trends. What began as a one-and-a-half-minute round-up turned into big budget productions, bringing together a growing roster of notable creators and celebrities recreating viral moments set to remixed tracks of hit songs. It was a fairly well-received \u2013 until 2018.\nWithin a week, YouTube Rewind 2018 racked up over 10 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube post of all time. Critics panned the video, including the CEO of YouTube's own daughter, arguing the company was promoting a self-serving view of the platform geared towards its own corporate interests, one that glossed how people were actually using and responding to the service. \"The community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\" reporter Julia Alexander wrote at the time. The speed and scope of the reaction was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\"For a long time, YouTube has been pretty tolerant of its creators' and audiences' criticisms. I think that's the sort of atmosphere where it's totally permissible for the audience to get really mad at the company,\" says Bergen. But \"the company has never been great at reading the room\".\nDespite the criticism, YouTube maintains that it's an inclusive space built to allow its community to thrive and feel empowered. \"YouTube has not only democratized content, but democratized opportunity,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"At YouTube, we developed a comprehensive approach aimed to ensure we\u2019re a video streaming platform for high-quality content.\" That includes a set of robust community guidelines, the spokesperson says, one the company works to apply equally to all users in order to combat the spread of harmful content and build a healthy environment that lets users flourish.\nRewind 2018 revealed a festering hostility that grew in the online space. \"There was a marked shift,\" Duffy says. In the earliest days, discussions about YouTube centered around the idea that it promoted a culture of positivity. YouTube's original slogan was \"Broadcast Yourself\" \u2013 creators and users saw the website as a project they were all working on together. But as time wore on, an adversarial tone erupted on the platform, Duffy says, and many started to feel the YouTube they helped build had become too powerful.\nThe biggest change, perhaps, was how people understood the role they played on the platform; once they were creating YouTube, but now, they were just using it.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

It's understandable the US might look for dialogue with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. \n\"But the US has always spoken about 'peace through strength.' And together we can take strong steps against Putin.\"\nIn Russia, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman called Zelensky's visit to Washington a \"complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv\".\nMaria Zakharova said the Ukrainian president is \"obsessed\" with prolonging the war, and repeated Russia's insistence to annex all territories currently occupied by Russia. \n\nAhead of the London summit, where European leaders will further discuss efforts to secure a peace deal, Zelensky met UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who said he retained \"unwavering support for Ukraine\".\nSpeaking inside his office, Sir Keir told Zelensky he was \"very, very welcome here in Downing Street\" and reiterated that the UK would stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it may take\".\nHe added: \"A lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine - so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom.\"\nSenior political figures from across Europe have also rallied behind Ukraine after Friday's extraordinary scenes in the US.\nThe leaders of Germany, France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were among those who posted social media messages backing Ukraine - with Zelensky responding directly to each one to thank them for their support.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron posted: \"There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\"\nGermany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no-one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\".\nSpeaking to the BBC on Saturday, Nato chief Mark Rutte said he had spoken to Zelensky twice following the White House meeting, and told him \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.\nHe referenced the first Trump administration's approval for the sale of Javelin anti-tank missile systems allowed Ukraine to \"fight back\". \nPutin launched the war two years after Trump had left office.\nRussia has been making slow gains on the battlefield for months.\nIn the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, officials said that 12 people, including two children, were injured in a \"massive\" overnight drone strike, a short while after Zelensky left the White House.\nThe casualties included four female patients at a hospital in the city centre. Residential buildings, pharmacies, cafes and shops were also been damaged, the Ukrainian prosecution service said. \nFriday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\nZelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous ceasefire deal in 2019, agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.",

In the end it happens.\n\"It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football.\"\nBoth Matt Doherty and Boubacar Traore missed spot-kicks for Wolves in the 5-4 shootout defeat after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes at Vitality Stadium.\nIt was a dramatic climax to a game where Evanilson had put the Cherries ahead on his return from injury, before his fellow Brazilian Cunha levelled with a sensational equaliser from around 30 yards.\nHowever, Cunha's display went from magical to madness with a dismissal that will leave his side - fourth bottom in the Premier League - without their best player for crucial games in their relegation fight.\nThe red-mist moment, where he clashed multiple times with Kerkez, including fighting, kicking out at the Hungarian full-back while he was on the ground and aiming a headbutt when Kerkez had got back to his feet.\nAfter being pulled away by team-mates, referee Sam Barrott eventually gave him a red card but a furious Cunha refused to leave the field, needing to be escorted and pushed down the tunnel. \nHe will be suspended for three games following the red card for violent conduct, but additional games cannot be ruled out because of the severity of the incident and having already served a two-match ban for clashing with Ipswich Town security in December.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Match of the Day: \"The ability he has is top level, the goal he scored belongs in the Champions League, but then suddenly we see the ugly.\n\"I have not seen that on the football pitch since the 1970s - he just lost it. The referee had to send him off. They couldn't get him out of the ground. This was the ugly part and it is something he has to stop.\n\"Wolves need points to stay up. He will be a huge loss.\"\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?\nWolves have what could be described as a favourable run of fixtures coming up against teams in the bottom half of the Premier League. \nBut Cunha is certain to miss matches against Everton, bottom club Southampton and West Ham, while third-bottom Ipswich follow on 5 April.\nWolves have built a five-point buffer over Ipswich and Leicester City after winning two of their past four league matches.\nBut losing talisman Cunha will be a massive blow, given he is their top league scorer on 13 goals and their attacking inspiration in this troubled campaign.\nCunha was sent off in the 120th minute of the match in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vitality Stadium\nCunha has been linked with a big-money move over the past year with Europe's top clubs keen, but he may be viewed as a loose cannon because of his antics.\nAs well as his aggressive display at Bournemouth, in an unsavoury incident at Ipswich earlier in the season, Cunha elbowed a member of the Portman Road staff before snatching his glasses off his face.\nThe Brazil forward is known to have a \u00a362.5m release clause in place which may also put off suitors looking to secure a summer transfer.\nWolves boss Pereira told BBC Match of the Day: \"When the situation happened I was looking for the ball.\n\"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today. Not only inside the pitch, but outside [the pitch]. With a lot of pressure, and in the end these are things that can happen.\n\"You know now he is frustrated, he is better in my opinion. I never speak to the team when we are nervous or frustrated. It is better to wait one day and think about everything. After we can have a talk.\n\"Of course, he is an important player, but next game we play with 11 and start with 11.\"\nSpeaking in his post-match news conference, he added: \"Matheus is a special player and today he played extra time. The last three weeks he has a problem in the hamstring and he tried.\n\"I didn't see the situation. Don't ask me about it because I was looking at the other end. In the end the referee decided the red card.\"\nAsked about whether Cunha deserves another chance, Pereira added: \"Of course, he is important but I cannot speak about what I don't know. It is important to check the situation, to look for what happened because I was looking for the other side.\n\"The others say to me he kick, he punch, he do what he did with the head and the player went to hospital? No, OK. But it is a situation that cannot happen of course.\n\"To judge the situation, I must have the clear image in my mind.\"\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola criticised the decision to show Kerkez a yellow card in the Cunha clash. It was was the defender's second in this season's FA Cup and means he will be banned from playing in the quarter-final tie.\n\"Milos Kerkez has received a yellow card for adopting an aggressive attitude,\" said Iraola. \"After what they have done to Milos Kerkez, they should reward him because [of] the attitude he has.\n\"They punch him, they kick him on the floor, they headbutt him and he doesn't react! You punish this? I will have to say to Milos [that] probably I cannot do as well as a player.\n\"The prize is they show him a yellow card and he will not play the quarter-final.

        "article_text": "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".\nThis was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.\nThe threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.\nTo pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.\nVery large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.\nThe potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.\nWith this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.\nThe plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.\nIn recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.\nThe challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.\nThree hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.\n\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.\nIn 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.\nThe switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.\nThe search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.\nBut a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.\n\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"\nProf Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.\nGPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.\nThe NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.\nWhen optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.\n\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.\nThe NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.\nEventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.\nYet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"\nWhile this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".\nBy carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.\nBut the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.\nHenry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".\nQuantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.\nGPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.\n\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.\n\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".\nThe ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.\nThis would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.\nQEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.\nThat process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.\nQuantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.\nBut it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. \n\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.\n\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"\nProminent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.\nBringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?\nOne day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "summary": "The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. \"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.Getty ImagesNPL's atomic clock, alongside clocks from around 80 labs worldwide, helps set Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the official global time standardTo pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.\nBut after Zelensky left early following a fiery exchange with Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the White House announced that the deal had not been signed.\nZelensky previously said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no US security guarantees had yet been agreed - something he had been pushing for.\nTrump had said a deal would help US taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war, but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning.\nThe preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction. \nShmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\". \nThe agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law. \nDisagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what appears to be a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.\n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nBut on Wednesday, he said no such guarantee had been made. \n\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" the Ukrainian leader explained. \nAsked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.\n\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"\nDespite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nHe said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.\nTrump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", adding that responsibility for this would now fall to Europe. \nBut he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".\nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\". \nThe US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.\nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced that the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is now unclear when the deal might be signed, if at all.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nVladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed.\nBut on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.\nCommenting on Zelensky's visit to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday: \"Whether it will be [to sign] the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet.\"",

And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "\"I grew up round here thinking I could not wait to get out,\" says 51-year-old Dan Davies.\n\"And then I used to come back up from London on a weekly basis and would see half the place boarded up and going downhill fast.\"\nNew Brighton, on the northern tip of the Wirral peninsula in Merseyside, was once a booming holiday destination boasting the longest promenade in the country, a pier and a tower bigger than Blackpool's.\nBut in the mid-1980s, after cheap package deals to Spain had become the first choice for many holidaymakers, New Brighton found itself struggling to keep up, and photographer Martin Parr's famous 1986 collection The Last Resort depicted it as a scruffy, litter-strewn town whose glory days were behind it.\nNow, though, it is undergoing a huge renaissance: in 2020 house prices rose faster in New Brighton than anywhere else in the country, investment is returning and businesses are thriving.\nSo how does a place go from being somewhere people cannot wait to leave to somewhere people cannot move to fast enough?\nFran Barrett, 35, returned to New Brighton after going away to London to study and work as a journalist.\n\"When you're a kid you never want to live where you're growing up,\" she said. \n\"But I realised as I got older why it was such a great place to live.\"\nWhile many of Fran's friends who stayed in London were still trying to get on the property ladder, she and her husband and toddler son were able to move up a rung in 2021 because of the \u00a330,000 they made in profit on their terraced home.\n\"It just has a real community feel to it,\" said Fran. \n\"There are so many new businesses springing up, and if you've got kids there are so many great little parks. \n\"A lot of my friends from other parts of the Wirral are moving here, too.\"\nAnd they all need places to eat, drink and shop. \nFran's sister Lou runs the caf\u00e9 bar and gift shop SUP, just one of many independent businesses that have sprung up in the town in recent years.\nA few hundred yards away from SUP is the James Atherton pub, which takes its name from the resort's founder who, in the 1830s, set about creating a northern version of Sussex seaside town Brighton.\nThe pub made national headlines in 2020 when it was renamed in a disparaging tribute to Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings and their three-tier coronavirus lockdown restrictions.\nIt is one of a number of buildings in Victoria Road that Dan's company Rockpoint Leisure revived.\nTo \"keep out the big boys\", as he puts it, the company bought up parcels of land and buildings and made sure independent shops, cafes and art spaces were able to move in. \nThe walls of many of them are now festooned with large murals by artists both local and global.\n\"We wanted to demonstrate that you don't need big outside consultants to come in and tell you what you need, you need a sustainable plan that can protect a place like New Brighton.\n\"We did that, and we have become the number one model for seaside town regeneration,\" he says.\nVictoria Road is a haven of independent businesses. \nThe Hatch art gallery opened in an old greengrocer's shop and took its name from the hatch through which people were served during the pandemic.\n\"Seaside towns are absolutely having a renaissance,\" says owner Anneley Pickles, 51. \n\"They just need things that will bring people here, whether that's food or entertainment, or workshops or arts spaces.\"\nJust up the road is Tallulah's Emporium, which owner Wayne Saunders describes as a \"listening space\" after the model of the Japanese kissa bars that specialise in playing jazz records.\nWayne, 51, left New Brighton in 1989, at a time when \"numerous friends from primary school had ended up dead or in prison\".\nHe moved to London, where he opened the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Shoreditch, before returning to New Brighton to open up Tallulah's in 2022.\nHe agrees with Dan's assessment that New Brighton is, with its thriving independent scene, \"Wirral's Brooklyn to Liverpool's Manhattan\".\nThere are not many remnants of New Brighton's past as a Victorian and Edwardian seaside town still visible today. \nThe tower was pulled down and sold for scrap in the 1920s, while the ballroom was gutted by fire in 1969 and then demolished.\nBut the town has always remained a seaside resort. \nIn 2011, the Marine Point development opened at an estimated cost of about \u00a365m, bringing a cinema, hotel, bars and restaurants to the seafront. \nIt stands a short distance from the Fort Perch Rock coastal defence battery \u2013 now a museum \u2013 which was built in the 1820s to protect Liverpool from foreign naval attack, and the Adventureland amusement complex which was built about 100 years later and which has been mooted for redevelopment as apartments in recent years.\nJayne Casey, a former member of punk band Big In Japan, now runs a small deli and arts bar District House just around the corner in Victoria Road.\nNow 68, she remembers the New Brighton of the 1980s that was encapsulated in Parr's Last Resort collection, and believes that, generally, the photos captured the area quite well.\n\"It was where people from Liverpool and the Wirral came for a cheap day out,\" she says.\n\"It had a beautiful 1930s outdoor swimming pool, and had that classic seaside town look to it.\n\"It was a place that working-class people came en-masse in the time when the factories closed down for a week and everyone had a week at the seaside.\"\nToday the resort is still popular with day trippers and families. \nAnd according to one person who was involved in its regeneration over the last decade, attempts to broaden what the town had to offer were not always met with open arms.\n\"There was a feeling from some that New Brighton is just about grandparents bringing their grandkids for day out,\" they said. \n\"But there were those who felt it was about more than just Fort Perch Rock and the promenade.\"\nJane, who helped transform a wilderness of empty warehouses near the Liverpool waterfront into the arts and tech enclave now known as the Baltic Triangle, says that while art and culture are playing a big part in New Brighton's renaissance and transformation, the town is not being \"gentrified\".\nGentrification is the process through which working-class urban populations find themselves displaced and priced out of their own communities.\n\"Yes, house prices have gone up and new people have come in but I don't think any kind of mass gentrification has happened,\" she says. \n\"But,\" she warns, \"there are some big sites that could come up and then could become apartment blocks and flats.\"\nNew Brighton's promenade \u2013 the longest in Britain \u2013 will be most familiar to those outside the north-west of England as the location of a Channel 4 ident that includes the TV network's logo running to keep pace with a group of wheelchair racers.\nNext month, the documentary I Am Martin Parr will be screened at The Light cinema, part of the Marine Point complex which looms over the promenade where that clip was filmed and where one of Parr's most infamous shots was taken.\nJose Wilmin, who has been coming to New Brighton for more than 60 years from her home in Ellesmere Port, has witnessed the resort going through its ups and downs in that time.\n\"It used to be a proper holiday place, there was a massive outdoor pool, a big funfair and the main street was just packed with bucket-and-spade shops,\" the 68-year-old says.\nWhile she says it is great to see New Brighton \"on the up again\", she has been a regular through good times and bad.\n\"I've always come here, to have fish and chips and watch the world go by.\n\"It's where I used to come with my mum.

They even don't hide it.\"\nThe Oval Office spat also prompted words of support for Zelensky from key European allies, including France.\nA spokeswoman for UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - who has cast himself as a mediator between the US and Europe as the Trump administration adopts a more isolationist approach to the continent - said he had spoken to both leaders.\nShe said Sir Keir \"retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace\".\nFriedrich Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, wrote that he stood with Ukraine \"in good and testing times\", adding: \"We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\"\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that \"today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge\".\nRussia, meanwhile, said Trump and Vance had acted with restraint. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said it was a miracle the pair hadn't hit Zelensky.",

        "article_text": "Since her debut in the 1976 remake of King Kong, Jessica Lange has never shied away from hard work.\nA double Oscar winner for 1982's Tootsie, and 1994's Blue Sky, she's starred in roles as eclectic as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Cape Fear, Rob Roy, Big Fish and Broken Flowers.\nOn television she played Joan Crawford in Feud, took home an Emmy for Grey Gardens and a stash of awards for one of the many roles she played in the American Horror Story franchise.\nBut she's also a familiar figure on the stage \u2013 in London and on Broadway \u2013 where she's appeared in classics A Streetcar Named Desire, The Glass Menagerie and Mother Play.\nAnd it's that ability to cross between stage and screen, classic plays and pulp fiction, which means that everything she attaches herself to is guaranteed a loyal audience.\nHer latest film is an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. The Pulitzer Prize winning play was written in 1940 but not staged until after O'Neill's death in 1956.\nA semi-autobiographical work dedicated to his wife, O'Neill described it as \"play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\"\n\"It has not been an easy project to get off the ground,\" Lange admits.\n\"This is a throwback to another kind of filmmaking and another kind of storytelling but in my mind this is the greatest American play ever written.\n\"It has this universality, this emotional depth. You'd be hard pressed not to relate to something in it, especially in the world we live in now.\"\nShe plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of an American family who's addicted to morphine since the birth of her sons, who struggles with loneliness and fears about her boys' health.\n\"Mary Tyrone is one of these parts which mean the world to me,\" says Lange.\n\"It may sound corny but I love her. It's thrilling as an actor to have a part like this.\"\nShe's played the role twice before on stage and it's the 2016 Broadway version, directed by Jonathan Kent, which has been brought to the screen. \nFilming wrapped in 2022 but it's only now that Lange and co-star Ed Harris have been able to premiere it in Dublin and Glasgow.\nShe arrived at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday just as Tim Roth, who appeared in the opening film Tornado, departed.\nThe two actors were in the 1995 film Rob Roy, she as Mary McGregor, wife of Liam Neeson's Rob Roy, and he as the villainous Archibald Cunningham.\nAnd while Roth's abiding memories were of his war with the Highland midgie, Lange recalls a much more pleasant experience.\n\"It was such a marvellous time, up in the Highlands where I'd never spent time before and it was extraordinarily beautiful,\" she says.\n\"I had the whole family here and the kids had a whole life of their own going on.\n\"It was a very special time and I liked the film. Some locations and some projects you think, 'oh Christ why did I bother doing that?' and others you think 'that was something very special'.\"\nHer next projects will also focus on women. She's set to star in the film adaptation of Joan Didion's 2005 memoir The Year of Magical Thinking.\nAnd she's also keen to explore an extraordinary chapter in the life of the German actress Marlene Dietrich.\nIt focuses on the period when she moved to America and took US citizenship and the programme will reunite her with Feud and American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy.\n\"At a certain age in the eyes of Hollywood you are finished,\" says Lange.\n\"We touched on this in Feud about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. This was the time in Dietrich's life, when she segued into this weird Las Vegas act and the story is about her meeting a young composer who helps her launch a whole new career as a performer.\"\nThat composer was Burt Bacharach and for five years their unlikely partnership revived her career.\n\"It's an interesting period,\" says Lange.\n\"It's also the time she goes back to Germany for the first time after the war, and takes her up to those years when she was living as a complete recluse in Paris.\"\nShe hopes the project will be up and running before the end of the year.\nHollywood may have a reputation for writing off its older women, but Jessica Lange, at 75, is still fighting their corner.",

        "article_text": "JD Vance's remarkable dressing down of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday showed the US vice-president unafraid to take centre stage as an attack dog, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy.\nIt was Vance who led the attack on Zelensky before Donald Trump joined the fray at the White House in a meeting that had been cordial until the vice-president spoke up to laud the president for seeking what he described as a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\" said Zelensky, who has been critical of direct talks between Washington and Moscow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded, tearing into the stunned Ukrainian leader.\n\"Mr President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\nHe also accused Zelensky of having campaigned on behalf of Democrats during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a munitions factory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met Trump's rival, Kamala Harris, at the White House.\nVance's upbraiding of Zelensky drew broad support among Republicans.\n\"I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country,\" said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy hawk. He suggested Zelensky should resign.\nAlabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as \"that Ukrainian weasel\".\nCongressman Mike Lawyer of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was \"a missed opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine\".\nVance's remarkable attack on a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president.\nTheir job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency.\nThe contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater.\nBut Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly sceptical of US aid to Ukraine.\nWhen he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: \"I've got to be honest with you. I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\"\nThe vice-president derided Trump as an idiot eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement.\nDespite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was \"too early\" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028.\nUndeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political brawler for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken criticism of the administration's foes.\nOne common thread is that many victims of Vance's tongue-lashing are America's allies.\nIt began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there.\nBut Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.\n\"If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,\" he said.\nThe audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified.\nThis was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.\nThis was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.\nNot for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.\nHis speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.\nYet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.\nVance accused him of \"moralistic garbage\", \"historical illiteracy\" and - worst of all - of being a \"globalist\".\nAnd if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.\nOut of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\".\nThe prime minister pushed back firmly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\u2026 We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\".\nThis was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.\nThe aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.\nSeveral questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe?\nWhite House sources have told US papers it was not.\nIs Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents?\nOr is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?\nWhatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.",

        "article_text": "These were already turbulent times in Romania.\nBut as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.\nA country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.\nWas a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "For the third week in a row, Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead.\nThe Vatican said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written \"in the past few days\". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care.\n\"I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\" he wrote.\n\"At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\"\nThe Pope told Catholics around the world that he felt their \"affection and closeness\". \n\"I feel as if I am 'carried' and supported by all God's people. Thank you all!\" the text reads.\nIn the latest update from the Vatican, Pope Francis was said to be resting after a \"peaceful\" night. \nOn Sunday morning, according to the Vatican, \"the Pope woke, had breakfast with coffee, continued his therapy and read the newspapers as he usually does\".\nThe Pope received two visitors in Gemelli hospital on Sunday \u2013 the first outside visitors the Vatican has mentioned since last Monday.\nOnce again, it was Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Parolin and his deputy, Monsignor Pena Parra, who saw Pope Francis in his 10th-floor hospital room.

It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.\nEdie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.\nShe added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.\nWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.\nAs Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.\nThe co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.\nEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film.\n\"It's giving chandelier,\" one reporter said to me backstage.\nOn social media the big question was: \"How is she going to sit down in that dress?\"\nOn the red carpet, there was quite a moment when Halle Berry ran up to Adrien Brody and gave him a big kiss. \nIt recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.\nShe told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".\nSpeaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.\nThe Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".\nBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.\nInside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.\nReality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to... Brody.\nActor Adam Sandler was in on the ongoing jokes about his typically casual attire.\nEarly on in the night, host Conan O'Brien called him out, saying he was \"dressed like a guy playing video poker at 2am\".\n(For reference, Sandler was in the audience wearing a blue hoodie and shorts, an ensemble that looked more at home on the basketball court).\nFollowing a playful back and forth between the two, the actor walked into the aisle of the theatre and said he was \"leaving\" before going over to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and shouting his surname, in the way he previously did on Saturday Night Live.\nChalamet, ever good natured, laughed along.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which killed 29 people. \nThe Grammys and Golden Globes both made the fires a central theme of the show.\nThe Academy Awards mentioned it only a handful of times, signalling Hollywood is moving on.\nThere was, however, one powerful moment, when O'Brien welcomed some of the firefighters who fought the blazes on stage. He called them \"heroes\", with the audience clapping and giving the emergency workers a standing ovation.\nO'Brien then said there are some jokes that even he isn't brave enough to tell - and asked some of the firefighters to read them out instead. \nLA Fire Captain Erik Scott read one joke off a teleprompter that said their hearts go out to everyone who lost their homes - including the makers of Joker 2.\nIt got a big laugh and O'Brien called it the best joke delivery of the night.\nIt was Zoe Salda\u00f1a's first Oscar, winning best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez - a musical about a transgender Mexican drug lord - and it marked one of the most powerful and emotional speeches of the night. \nShe broke down in tears immediately, crying out \"Mommy\", to her mother in the audience.\n\"I am floored by this honour,\" she wept, paying tribute to her fellow nominees for their \"loving and community\", saying \"I will pay it forward\".\nPraising the film's cast and crew, she got emotional as she talked about her family.\n\"Everything brave, outrageous and good I've ever done in my life is because of you,\" she said, praising her husband, his \"beautiful hair\" and their three sons.\n\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961 - I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands.\n\"I'm the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award and I know I won't be the last.\n\"Getting an award where I got to sing and speak in Spanish - this is for my grandmother.\"\nThe month-long saga to obtain a US visa by two Iranian filmmakers ended in the pair winning the best animated short film Academy Award - with them rushing to even make the ceremony in Hollywood. \nHossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani arrived at Los Angeles airport just hours before the Oscars award ceremony was due to begin.\nAfter their plane landed, they quickly changed outfits in a public restroom and made it with only moments to go before winning the award for their film, In the Shadow of the Cypress.\n\"It's not our fault we are so late,\" Sohani said to BBC News before the show. \"We couldn't get a visa. It's a difficult relationship\" between the US and Iran, she explained.\n\"Until yesterday we hadn't obtained our visa and now we are standing here with this statuette in our hands,\" said Molayemi in his acceptance speech.\n\"Speaking in front of this expectant audience is very hard for us,\" he added. \"Yes, if we preserve and remain faithful, miracles will happen.\"\nAs ever, politics reared its head during Sunday night's ceremony.\nHost O'Brien made a quip about how Anora was \"having a good night\", before saying: \"I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian.\"\nO'Brien must have been writing his monologue up to the very last minute, because the joke appeared to be a nod to the White House spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump.\nMeanwhile, the No Other Land documentary team descended on the red carpet wearing Palestinian scarves and Kufiya. Their film is set in the occupied West Bank. After they won for the film, the team took the stage and called out US policy in the region.\nKill Bill star Daryl Hannah also veered into politics while on stage. She referenced the war in Ukraine, saying \"Slava Ukraini\", the country's salute, as she presented an award.\nBut one person wasn't mentioned. \nHere in liberal Hollywood, you may have expected jokes and barbs toward Donald Trump - but his name didn't come up even once.",

        "article_text": "Meghan's new Netflix series in which she offers cooking and home tips arrives next week. She's just the latest high-profile woman to present herself as a lifestyle guru \u2013 and divide opinion in doing so.\nThe Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle show is finally arriving on Netflix on Tuesday, after being pushed back because of the Los Angeles fires. With Love, Meghan sees her picking flowers, cooking with friends, and looking radiant in a huge, glossy Californian home.\nThe move into such well-worn domestic-goddess territory saw Meghan instantly dubbed \"the millennial Martha Stewart of Montecito\" in The New York Times. But of course, this being Meghan \u2013 the subject of a vast amount of criticism in the British media specifically and on social media generally \u2013 backlash flared the minute the trailer was released. She's flaunting her wealth, said her critics: tone-deaf. She's becoming a trad wife: bad feminist. She's fake, she just wants to sell products, she's unbearably earnest\u2026\u00a0\nAnd yet, Meghan has her fans as much as her detractors, and it's likely that With Love, Meghan will be a ratings hit for the streamer, bringing people together: not always in the way the show intends perhaps, but by persuading both those who buy into the pretty-princess fantasy \u2013 and those who may \"hate-watch\" it \u2013 to tune in, agog. \"Everyone's invited to create wonder in every moment\" \u2013 as Meghan puts it.\nThe public's feelings towards domestic goddesses \u2013 those women who sell a lifestyle, and a very particular idealised version of womanhood \u2013 have always been complex, but they may have never been more conflicted than in 2025. \"Of course, the image of the idealised woman has changed over time, and even more rapidly in recent years\" says Dr Edith Hill, an Australian academic whose research is in social media, influencers and women's bodies online. These days, Hill tells the BBC, \"there is no one ''ideal' image of a woman online, as each community and sub-community has their own version of the perfect creator.\" This means that the most famous end up both loved and loathed: figures like Meghan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nara Smith walk the line between having devoted fanbases, and being scorned, castigated and even blamed for a wealth of societal ills.\nNara Smith is probably the most famous iteration of the most vexed contemporary version of the domestic goddess: the trad wife. Smith has 11.5 million followers on TikTok \u2013 that's a lot of people who want to watch videos from her home in Texas, where she raises kids and bakes their food from scratch. While wearing ballgowns. In a gorgeous kitchen. You could say it's aggressively aspirational \u2013 but it's also patently unrealistic. I doubt many people watching genuinely wish they too could make their toddlers homemade bubblegum while wearing a lime-green conical-bust gown. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\n\u2022 Ten of the best TV shows to watch this March\n\u2022 Why influencers are facing a pushback\nOf course, many women do find joy and satisfaction in the kitchen \u2013 or in other traditional domestic activities, such as hosting, home-making, arranging flowers, dressing in a feminine way\u2026 there's nothing inherently \"unfeminist\" with any of that. But the broader interest in trad wives \u2013 women who espouse traditional 1950s-style family values, and dedicate themselves wholly to keeping house and raising kids \u2013 has been seen by many as a worryingly retrograde step. Less domestic goddess, more domestic servitude, is the gist of the criticism. \"There is a certain undertone from some of the more traditional creators that does lean toward very stereotypical gender roles and strong religious ideals, that can lead to the oppression of women,\" says Hill. \"It would be naive to ignore the very close line that can be drawn between that content and women's oppression.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recent obsession with trad wives may reflect a broader disenchantment with modern lifestyles: the anxiety that what equality of the sexes actually brought us is merely drudgery for all. When two parents have to work constantly in order to have enough money to live, and women also end updoing a \"second shift\" of housework and childcare, the old model of dividing the labour might look more appealing.\nArguably, we could more accurately place the source of the problem with capitalism, rather than feminism \"gone too far\". And it is unfortunately inevitable that full-time tradwiffery requires a partner who earns a lot of money, inevitably also bringing that traditional dynamic into play: domestic bliss predicated on man-as-breadwinner, woman-as-helpmeet.\nBut as much as there is endless hand-wringing in the media over the meaning of the trad-wife phenomenon, in some ways, it's nothing new: domestic goddesses have always been a source of fascination \u2013 dismissed as retrograde by some, and yet a source of aspiration, inspiration, and even compulsion for others. Because they don't just present a certain lifestyle: they often promise that you, scruffy disorganised frazzled ordinary woman, could be a domestic goddess too, if you just do what they say. Witness: the OG DG, Martha Stewart, who made a multi-million-dollar empire out of housekeeping tips.\nStewart made her name as a hard-grafting lifestyle guru who would tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it properly, whether putting up a shelf or planning a wedding. And part of the appeal of domestic goddesses has always been this illusion of control, of solution: do this, and have a better life.\nStewart started out running a catering business in 1975, before publishing the legendary 1982 glossy how-to guide, Entertaining. It was just the starting gun of the unstoppable Martha Stewart brand, that's since flogged everything from tea towels to CBD gummies; she's published more than 100 books offering brisk guidance on gardening, hosting, cooking and homemaking. And the news that Entertaining is to be republished this year surely supports the theory that we're in a retro domestic goddess moment.\nFollowing in Martha's footsteps came another US DG who inspires a devoted following: Ina Garten aka The Barefoot Contessa. Garten just published a memoir, Be Ready When the Luck Happens, designed to persuade people that her seemingly charmed career \u2013 from running a Hamptons food store so casually chic that it featured in a Nancy Meyers movie, to fronting scores of cookery books and TV shows since the 90s \u2013 was the result of hard work and good timing, a blend of effort and effortlessness.\nGarten's recipes also straddle effort and effortlessness: she specialises in rich, indulgent, bistro-style deliciousness, and offers detailed instruction as to exactly how to achieve it. But she's won fans for her catchphrase \"store-bought is fine\": a pinch of realism amid the lifestyle gloss.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd of course, not all domestic goddesses have been about perfection or spending hours in the kitchen \u2013 in fact, many have made a career out of proffering tips and tricks to make hosting and homemaking easier. Shirley Conran, the British journalist and author \u2013 also sometimes called the \"original\" domestic goddess \u2013\u00a0 promoted the idea of women \"having it all\", and famously informed women in her 1975 pop-feminism housework manual Superwoman that \"life is too short to stuff a mushroom\". Nara Smith clearly didn't get the memo.\nThe idea of Superwoman was to liberate women from the tyranny of housework and perfection, not to be trapped by it: a domestic goddess in the 70s was the woman who had it all \u2013 job, home, marriage, kids, good sex, control of their finances, and a general air of fabulousness. The title was not actually meant to be taken seriously: \"A Superwoman isn\u2019t a woman who can do anything, but a woman who avoids doing too much,\" Conran wrote.\nAnd missing the irony has often been an issue for DGs \u2013 not least for the deliciously tongue-in-cheek Nigella Lawson, who helped popularise the term. The curvaceous, flirtatious British chef also began her career with a book full of time-saving tips and anti-perfectionist reassurance: \"Never worry about what your guests will think of you,\" she wrote encouragingly in How to Eat. \"Just think of the food. What will taste good?\"\nBut her second book in 1998 was called How to Be a Domestic Goddess \u2013 a joke that was missed, she's long insisted, and a title that now makes her cringe. \"It was supposed to be ironic,\" she told the New York Times in 2019. Today, Lawson is a full-on national treasure in the UK, but at the start of her fame, and rather like today's trad wives, she was castigated by some critics who accused her of setting back feminism. She has since countered her critics by describing baking as feminist.\nA domestic goddess became a standard to live up to, and yet another reason for women to feel inadequate. And this is the contradiction at the heart of DGs, whether they\u2019re incredibly earnest (Meghan; Gwyneth) or winkingly ironic (Lawson): while many give off an air of effortlessness and espouse mantras of ease for most women most of the time, such domestic bliss is actually not easy. Or, indeed, affordable. \"We're not in the pursuit of perfection, we're in the pursuit of joy,\" declares Meghan in the trailer for her show.\u00a0 But it's hard not to feel like it would be a lot easier to pursue joy if you lived in a Californian mansion with help. To state the obvious, an enviable, idealised lifestyle is more readily available when you don't have to stress about the bills, and instead have the free time to, say, learn to fold a napkin like an Easter bunny.\nIt is also so obvious as to be almost banal to point out that DGs are mostly very wealthy. And fortune begets fortune: all this lifestyle content is, on some level, also an advert for the DGs' product lines, whether that's Meghan's company, As Ever, selling jams, Ina's cookware, or Gwyneth\u2019s Goop empire.\nFor some, the wholesome, homespun emphasis on making preserves or crafting your own table decorations is particularly grating precisely because these women are clearly monied and leisured enough to have time for all that. Yet for others, that's what's appealing, even soothing, about watching them: we may not have a spare four hours to bake, but we can watch a four-minute video of Nara Smith baking; we may not have the money to make like Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway at the opening of the eponymous novel, and buy the flowers ourselves, but we can watch Meghan pick out blooms in a fancy florist.\n\"The domesticity is presented to us as peaceful while also fulfilling,\" says Hill, on the appeal of this sort of content, which it is so easy to be cynical about. \"Many people can relate to wanting to nourish and nurture their families, but what this looks like in reality for everyone else is at complete odds to the image we're presented through these curated narratives.\"\nPerhaps this is the key: we mustn't mistake today's goddesses with mere mortals \u2013 consider them floating fictional constructs, higher(-earning) beings. And absolutely not a yardstick against which to measure ideal femininity. \"I think we can be inspired by these women and the lives they are presenting,\" say Hill, \"while also recognising it is wholly impossible to attain.\"\nWith Love, Meghan is on Netflix from 4 March\nHolly Williams's novel, The Start of Something, is out in paperback now\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

The winning runs were hit after the sun had set and the locals had broken their Ramadan fast.\nAt one point on Saturday, there were fears the floodlights would not be needed.\n\"As a whole group, not just batters, we're not getting the results and that does take away your confidence,\" captain Jos Buttler said.\n\"It's time for everyone to get away, get a change of scenery and work hard wherever cricket takes you next.\"\nButtler knows this feeling because the seven-wicket defeat by South Africa was English white-ball cricket going full circle.\nBack in 2015, he was part of the side also dismissed cheaply before their opponents cantered home - New Zealand the victors on that occasion in Wellington.\nThat day England's players sat in silence in a shell-shocked dressing room as the baying crowd shook the foundations of the stadium above them.\nThis was a Champions Trophy dead rubber rather than a live World Cup match and there were no such problems with the crowd.\nStill, it must be the spark of a rebuild, like the Cake Tin defeat was to Eoin Morgan.\nThis has to be England's latest visit to rock bottom.\nMcCullum does not rule out making outsider captain\nEngland's Champions Trophy ends in sorry defeat\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nThe quirk is that England's destroyer 10 years ago will be the one to plot the path ahead to ultimately regain the world titles lost. \n\"These guys are too hard on themselves,\" said their opponent turned coach Brendon McCullum.\n\"They've got immense talent, they are desperate to want to perform. That's actually stymying the ability of us to get the performance we want. They care too much.\"\nExpect hard work but no change in England's rhetoric.\nAnd while there is some merit in McCullum words - relaxing his players and removing the fear of failure is what has helped him turn around the fortunes of the Test side alongside Ben Stokes - it was not the reason Phil Salt and Jamie Smith gave away their wickets or Liam Livingstone looked a novice when faced with spinner Keshav Maharaj.\nAttacking shots are causing England's downfall, not tentative prods. There is more at play here - muddled minds aplenty.\nThis video can not be played\nJansen's three wickets against England\nMcCullum finds himself in a tricky spot.\nMorgan's rebuild was remarkable, it progressed all the way to Lord's in 2019, but it began at a distinct path, with England playing dull, dated cricket.\nThe requirements were clear - pick younger, more ambitious players available in county cricket but not selected. The present-day route is far less obvious.\nInitially, McCullum must decide if these are good players underperforming.\nDebate can be had over Liam Dawson, who should have been in Pakistan as an all-rounder and second spin option, but there are few other glaring omissions. \nWould the 35-year-old left-arm spinner have made this side semi-finalists? You are always a better player when away from the spotlight.\nLivingstone looks to be fighting for his ODI future and Salt is under pressure after a tournament in which he has averaged 10, but the rest of the top seven - Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler and, to a lesser extent given his poor showing here, Smith - still looks a fearsome line-up on paper.\nIn contrast, the bowling needs work and McCullum hinted at regrets over the limited, pace-heavy approach employed in Pakistan.\n\"Obviously, our gameplan was to try and bring fast bowling over here, try to stock our batting and give ourselves that sort of conviction and that method,\" McCullum said.\n\"We may not have got it totally right this time but you've got to have conviction in something.\"\nHis side's new-ball economy rate is currently the most expensive in the world, their powerplay threat only better than Zimbabwe, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates and their middle-over record in Pakistan their worst at a major tournament.\nIt leaves plenty of room for improvement.\nBut with Jofra Archer on a three-year contract and Mark Wood lauded wholesale change does not look likely.\nHampshire quick Sonny Baker - the 21-year-old who impressed for the Lions this winter - is one on the radar, while there is still hope Josh Hull could be the left-armer England so desperately require, but otherwise England will rebuild with the players seen here, meaning other gains will have to be made.\nIt is three months and 23 days since England lined up with a top seven of Salt, Will Jacks, Jordan Cox, Bethell, Livingstone, Sam Curran and Dan Mousely. Greater consistency in selection would be a good place to start.\nThat will be aided by the fact McCullum is now in charge of both red and white-ball teams, meaning there is no longer a tussle between two coaches with two different priorities.\nDifficulties will still appear with the New Zealander keen to promote multi-format regulars rather than white-ball specialists, which will leave a winter featuring an Ashes series flanked by white-ball trips to New Zealand and Sri Lanka to be balanced with great care.\nMcCullum is now England's man for all seasons, who has sparked a rebuild twice before - first in Wellington and then with the Test side.\nHis third act may be his most difficult.",

        "article_text": "\"I grew up round here thinking I could not wait to get out,\" says 51-year-old Dan Davies.\n\"And then I used to come back up from London on a weekly basis and would see half the place boarded up and going downhill fast.\"\nNew Brighton, on the northern tip of the Wirral peninsula in Merseyside, was once a booming holiday destination boasting the longest promenade in the country, a pier and a tower bigger than Blackpool's.\nBut in the mid-1980s, after cheap package deals to Spain had become the first choice for many holidaymakers, New Brighton found itself struggling to keep up, and photographer Martin Parr's famous 1986 collection The Last Resort depicted it as a scruffy, litter-strewn town whose glory days were behind it.\nNow, though, it is undergoing a huge renaissance: in 2020 house prices rose faster in New Brighton than anywhere else in the country, investment is returning and businesses are thriving.\nSo how does a place go from being somewhere people cannot wait to leave to somewhere people cannot move to fast enough?\nFran Barrett, 35, returned to New Brighton after going away to London to study and work as a journalist.\n\"When you're a kid you never want to live where you're growing up,\" she said. \n\"But I realised as I got older why it was such a great place to live.\"\nWhile many of Fran's friends who stayed in London were still trying to get on the property ladder, she and her husband and toddler son were able to move up a rung in 2021 because of the \u00a330,000 they made in profit on their terraced home.\n\"It just has a real community feel to it,\" said Fran. \n\"There are so many new businesses springing up, and if you've got kids there are so many great little parks. \n\"A lot of my friends from other parts of the Wirral are moving here, too.\"\nAnd they all need places to eat, drink and shop. \nFran's sister Lou runs the caf\u00e9 bar and gift shop SUP, just one of many independent businesses that have sprung up in the town in recent years.\nA few hundred yards away from SUP is the James Atherton pub, which takes its name from the resort's founder who, in the 1830s, set about creating a northern version of Sussex seaside town Brighton.\nThe pub made national headlines in 2020 when it was renamed in a disparaging tribute to Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings and their three-tier coronavirus lockdown restrictions.\nIt is one of a number of buildings in Victoria Road that Dan's company Rockpoint Leisure revived.\nTo \"keep out the big boys\", as he puts it, the company bought up parcels of land and buildings and made sure independent shops, cafes and art spaces were able to move in. \nThe walls of many of them are now festooned with large murals by artists both local and global.\n\"We wanted to demonstrate that you don't need big outside consultants to come in and tell you what you need, you need a sustainable plan that can protect a place like New Brighton.\n\"We did that, and we have become the number one model for seaside town regeneration,\" he says.\nVictoria Road is a haven of independent businesses. \nThe Hatch art gallery opened in an old greengrocer's shop and took its name from the hatch through which people were served during the pandemic.\n\"Seaside towns are absolutely having a renaissance,\" says owner Anneley Pickles, 51. \n\"They just need things that will bring people here, whether that's food or entertainment, or workshops or arts spaces.\"\nJust up the road is Tallulah's Emporium, which owner Wayne Saunders describes as a \"listening space\" after the model of the Japanese kissa bars that specialise in playing jazz records.\nWayne, 51, left New Brighton in 1989, at a time when \"numerous friends from primary school had ended up dead or in prison\".\nHe moved to London, where he opened the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Shoreditch, before returning to New Brighton to open up Tallulah's in 2022.\nHe agrees with Dan's assessment that New Brighton is, with its thriving independent scene, \"Wirral's Brooklyn to Liverpool's Manhattan\".\nThere are not many remnants of New Brighton's past as a Victorian and Edwardian seaside town still visible today. \nThe tower was pulled down and sold for scrap in the 1920s, while the ballroom was gutted by fire in 1969 and then demolished.\nBut the town has always remained a seaside resort. \nIn 2011, the Marine Point development opened at an estimated cost of about \u00a365m, bringing a cinema, hotel, bars and restaurants to the seafront. \nIt stands a short distance from the Fort Perch Rock coastal defence battery \u2013 now a museum \u2013 which was built in the 1820s to protect Liverpool from foreign naval attack, and the Adventureland amusement complex which was built about 100 years later and which has been mooted for redevelopment as apartments in recent years.\nJayne Casey, a former member of punk band Big In Japan, now runs a small deli and arts bar District House just around the corner in Victoria Road.\nNow 68, she remembers the New Brighton of the 1980s that was encapsulated in Parr's Last Resort collection, and believes that, generally, the photos captured the area quite well.\n\"It was where people from Liverpool and the Wirral came for a cheap day out,\" she says.\n\"It had a beautiful 1930s outdoor swimming pool, and had that classic seaside town look to it.\n\"It was a place that working-class people came en-masse in the time when the factories closed down for a week and everyone had a week at the seaside.\"\nToday the resort is still popular with day trippers and families. \nAnd according to one person who was involved in its regeneration over the last decade, attempts to broaden what the town had to offer were not always met with open arms.\n\"There was a feeling from some that New Brighton is just about grandparents bringing their grandkids for day out,\" they said. \n\"But there were those who felt it was about more than just Fort Perch Rock and the promenade.\"\nJane, who helped transform a wilderness of empty warehouses near the Liverpool waterfront into the arts and tech enclave now known as the Baltic Triangle, says that while art and culture are playing a big part in New Brighton's renaissance and transformation, the town is not being \"gentrified\".\nGentrification is the process through which working-class urban populations find themselves displaced and priced out of their own communities.\n\"Yes, house prices have gone up and new people have come in but I don't think any kind of mass gentrification has happened,\" she says. \n\"But,\" she warns, \"there are some big sites that could come up and then could become apartment blocks and flats.\"\nNew Brighton's promenade \u2013 the longest in Britain \u2013 will be most familiar to those outside the north-west of England as the location of a Channel 4 ident that includes the TV network's logo running to keep pace with a group of wheelchair racers.\nNext month, the documentary I Am Martin Parr will be screened at The Light cinema, part of the Marine Point complex which looms over the promenade where that clip was filmed and where one of Parr's most infamous shots was taken.\nJose Wilmin, who has been coming to New Brighton for more than 60 years from her home in Ellesmere Port, has witnessed the resort going through its ups and downs in that time.\n\"It used to be a proper holiday place, there was a massive outdoor pool, a big funfair and the main street was just packed with bucket-and-spade shops,\" the 68-year-old says.\nWhile she says it is great to see New Brighton \"on the up again\", she has been a regular through good times and bad.\n\"I've always come here, to have fish and chips and watch the world go by.\n\"It's

        "article_text": "In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.\nTo fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".\n\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"\nTwo years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.\nBut now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.\nCorporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.\nThe moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.\nSince assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\nIn the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.\nAt first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".\nProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.\nUnder names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.\nAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.\nDEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.\nThe programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.\nBut almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".\nMore recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.\nThe roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".\nSocial media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.\nOne of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.\nAnother major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.\nThe ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.\nThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.\nMartin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.\nSurveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".\nMuch rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.\nSome research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.\nThis research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.\nThe problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.\nShe cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.\nBut Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.\nAnd when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.\nWhere studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.\nSupporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.\nLast autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year \u2013 43 \u2013 and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.\nColleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.\nBut the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.\nFor the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.\nBecause of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.\nBut another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.\nDartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.\nIt's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.\nMichelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"\nBut as to the question at the centre of her book \u2013 is DEI dead? \u2013 Jolivet says the answer is no.\nThe companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.\nShe gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"\nBut not everyone is reassured.\nBack in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.\nShe fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".\nShe says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\"\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

He is making runs and is willing but is a little isolated. \n\"Not just Hojlund but Joshua Zirkzee has given up the ball too many times. There is not enough creativity and they are not holding up the ball for the midfielders and defenders to support them, so it's a bit of both.\"\nRooney calls Amorim 'naive' for saying Man Utd want Premier League title\nMatch of the Day 2: Deeney feels sorry for Hojlund\nThis video can not be played\n'I feel sorry for Rasmus Hojlund' - Troy Deeney\nHojlund had to wait until 26 December for his first Premier League goal last term. \nBut that prompted a purple patch of eight goals in eight games, with an  injury-interrupted first season at the club ending with 16 goals in 43 matches.\nHowever, he has only managed seven in 35 fixtures in all competitions this term and  that drop-off appears no surprise given he has averaged 1.5 shots per game over the course of the season while making just 3.5 touches on average in an opponent's penalty area.\nGarnacho (8.4), Diallo (7.3), Rashford (5.1) and Zirkzee (4.7) have all had more touches in the opposition box than the Dane. \nThat same quartet plus Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro also average more shots on goal than Hojlund, who registered 12 goals in 21 appearances for Sturm Graz and another 10 in 34 games in Italy.\nThose figures also look woefully low when you consider that Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz had 16 touches between them in the Manchester City penalty area in their Premier League victory just over a week ago.\nObi also managed six against Fulham in six minutes less and another cause for concern is that Hojlund's numbers have dropped since 19 December to 1.3 and 3.1. \nChris Sutton, who won the Golden Boot as joint-top Premier League goalscorer when he was with Blackburn in 1997-98 can relate to Hojlund's experience, having endured a miserable spell when at Chelsea where he went 21 games without a goal.\n\"The first thing I consider when any striker is being criticised is whether he is getting loads of chances? I'm not so sure Hojlund is,\" Sutton told BBC Sport.\n\"He is suffering, as a lot of strikers do, from that chronic lack of confidence which leads to a lack of belief and hesitancy. When strikers go on runs like the one he is on, it plays on your mind. It is probably affecting all his game, not just in front of goal, and the longer it goes on the worse it gets.\n\"Is the effort there? Yes, absolutely. Could he be doing better? Of course he could be but you could say that about virtually every Manchester United player.  \n\"You have to remember that United are not just under-performing a little bit, they are miles off it. There is an argument that, under Ruben Amorim, they have got worse than they were under Erik ten Hag.\n\"His issue at United is that, as well as trying to find some form, all strikers are reliant on service and he is not getting much.\"\nChief football news reporter, Simon Stone\nHojlund's valuation jumped up a huge amount in a very short space of time with moves from Copenhagen to Sturm Graz and then Atalanta.\nAnd even though his goal record was not exceptional, comparisons were drawn at the time with fellow Scandinavian forward Erling Haaland due to the size, strength and speed of both players. \nWhile United were convinced of his potential to develop into a top-class centre-forward, he has not fulfilled that and although he has shown glimpses of his finishing power, his confidence now looks shattered. \nHe never looked like getting in a position to score against Fulham and is not the sort of forward that drops deeper and gets involved in the build-up play. \nThe Dane was also not helped by Garnacho being named as a substitute given he seems to be the one player in the current squad that can stretch a game and provide some support.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

The Pulitzer Prize winning play was written in 1940 but not staged until after O'Neill's death in 1956.\nA semi-autobiographical work dedicated to his wife, O'Neill described it as \"play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\"\n\"It has not been an easy project to get off the ground,\" Lange admits.\n\"This is a throwback to another kind of filmmaking and another kind of storytelling but in my mind this is the greatest American play ever written.\n\"It has this universality, this emotional depth. You'd be hard pressed not to relate to something in it, especially in the world we live in now.\"\nShe plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of an American family who's addicted to morphine since the birth of her sons, who struggles with loneliness and fears about her boys' health.\n\"Mary Tyrone is one of these parts which mean the world to me,\" says Lange.\n\"It may sound corny but I love her. It's thrilling as an actor to have a part like this.\"\nShe's played the role twice before on stage and it's the 2016 Broadway version, directed by Jonathan Kent, which has been brought to the screen. \nFilming wrapped in 2022 but it's only now that Lange and co-star Ed Harris have been able to premiere it in Dublin and Glasgow.\nShe arrived at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday just as Tim Roth, who appeared in the opening film Tornado, departed.\nThe two actors were in the 1995 film Rob Roy, she as Mary McGregor, wife of Liam Neeson's Rob Roy, and he as the villainous Archibald Cunningham.\nAnd while Roth's abiding memories were of his war with the Highland midgie, Lange recalls a much more pleasant experience.\n\"It was such a marvellous time, up in the Highlands where I'd never spent time before and it was extraordinarily beautiful,\" she says.\n\"I had the whole family here and the kids had a whole life of their own going on.\n\"It was a very special time and I liked the film.

        "article_text": "Urine was used as fertiliser in ancient Rome and China. Now farmers in Vermont are bringing this practice back to boost harvests and grow crops in a more sustainable way.\nWhen Betsy Williams goes to the loo, she likes to know her pee won't go to waste. For the last 12 years, she and her neighbours in rural Vermont, US, have diligently collected their urine and donated it to farmers for use as fertiliser for their crops.\n\"We're consuming all of these things that have nutrients in them, and then a lot of the nutrients that are passing through us can then get recycled back into helping create food for us and for animals. So to me, it's logical,\" Williams says.\nWilliams takes part in the Urine Nutrient Reclamation Program (UNRP), a programme run by the Rich Earth Institute (REI), a non-profit based in Vermont. She and 250 of her neighbours in Windham County donate a total of 12,000 gallons (45,400 litres) of urine to the programme each year to be recycled \u2013 or \"peecycled\".\u00a0\nWindham County's pee-donations are collected by a lorry and driven to a large tank where the urine is pasteurised by heating it to 80C (176F) for 90 seconds. It is then stored in a pasteurised tank, ready to be sprayed on local farmland when the time is right to fertilise crops.\nRecords suggest that urine was used to help grow crops back in ancient China and\u00a0ancient Rome. Today, scientists are finding that it can\u00a0more than double the yield of crops like kale and spinach compared to no fertiliser, and improve yields even in low fertility soils.\nUrine's power as a fertiliser is due to the nitrogen and phosphorus that it contains \u2013 the same nutrients that are added to the synthetic fertilisers used on many conventional farms. But these synthetic fertilisers come at an environmental cost. Nitrogen is produced using the fossil fuel-intensive Haber-Bosch process, and the mining of phosphorus creates harmful amounts of toxic waste. Urine, meanwhile, is freely available \u2013\u00a0as Williams puts it, \"everybody pees. [It's an] untapped resource\".\nNancy Love, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan who has collaborated with the team at REI over the last decade, has found that using urine instead of standard synthetic fertiliser reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and requires around half the amount of water. Indeed, since 2012, UNRP estimates that it has conserved over 2.7 million gallons (10.2 million litres) of water through preventing toilet flushes.\n\"I've always been a systems thinker, and our [water] system has inefficiencies in it,\" Love says. \"What we do today is dilute the hell out of our urine, we put it in a pipe, we send it to a treatment plant, and then we pump a bunch more energy into it, just to send it back into the environment in a reactive form.\"\nIn the case of urine's nutrients, its typical destination is waterways. The nitrogen and phosphorus in urine are not fully removed from wastewater when it is treated. When these nutrients find their way into rivers and lakes, they are taken up by algae. The result can be\u00a0algal blooms that choke up waterways, unbalancing the ecosystem and killing other species that live there.\n\"Our bodies create a lot of nutrients, and right now those nutrients are not only wasted, but they\u2019re actually causing a lot of problems and harm downstream,\" says Jamina Shupack, REI's executive director.\nThese nutrients are food for algae \u2013\u00a0but also for crops. \"Wherever you put nitrogen, it's going to help plants grow. So if it's in the water, it's helping the algae grow. But if it's on the land, it's going to help plants grow,\u201d Shupack explains. Because of this, diverting nutrient-rich urine away from waterways and onto the land can prevent harmful algal blooms while helping farmers grow food.\nImportantly, the REI team and the farmers they work with take steps to minimise how much of the urine runs off the land and into waterways. Application is carefully timed, so that it happens when the plant is most able to take up the nutrients \u2013 typically during the plant's more active growth stage, when it's bigger than a seedling but not yet fruiting. The soil moisture is also measured, to make sure the liquid urine will be absorbed. Despite these efforts, \"that doesn't mean that there isn't going to be runoff\", Shupack says.\nEven so, she adds, peecycling reduces the overall amount of nutrients entering waterways because it ensures that runoff from the land is the only way excess nutrients enter rivers and lakes. In the current system, synthetic fertilisers run off into waterways, as well as urine entering rivers directly via wastewater.\nThe UNRP in Vermont is pioneering peecycling in the US, but projects in other countries are also underway. In Paris, volunteers are collecting urine to help save the River Seine and fertilise wheat for baguettes and biscuits. Swedish entrepreneurs saw the harm caused by algal blooms around the island of Gotland and came up with a product that collects urine and turns it into fertiliser. Peecycling pilots have also run in South Africa, Nepal and Niger Republic.\nBut expanding this work comes with challenges. Shupack says that in Vermont, farmers' demand for urine outstrips supply \u2013\u00a0but scaling up collection is tricky. Regulation can create a barrier, she says. \"A lot of times you go to a regulator and they say: 'We don't have a form for urine \u2013 the only place I know where to put urine is with biosolids, or within wastewater treatment.' So it's not really categorised in a way that would make sense to do what we're doing,\" she says.\nTo overcome this, Shupack says that REI have got to grips with the detailed language of regulations so they could spot possible paths and partnered with organisations with existing permits \u2013\u00a0such as septic haulers \u2013\u00a0to tackle the different parts of the process, and the permits needed, in a piecemeal way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The farmers protecting Nepal's snow leopards\n\u2022\u00a0The rewilded golf courses teeming with life\n\u2022\u00a0The beer sludge being turned into vegan milk\nEamon Twohig, programme manager at Vermont's Department of Environmental Conservation (VTDEC), tells the BBC that when REI initially approached them \"it was clear there was no 'regulatory box' for urine treatment/recycling\u2026 REI has certainly blazed a trail here in Vermont, and I think we've managed to find a workable, regulatory pathway.\"\nREI has a good relationship with regulators in Vermont, Shupack says, and has all the permits needed to operate \u2013\u00a0including one for innovative on-site wastewater management, and a waste-hauling permit for transporting urine. Now the organisation is working with partners in Massachusetts and Michigan to move regulation on. \"We're really trying to push that forward. But it's not always easy to get new environmental regulations updated,\" Shupack says. One of the biggest challenges, she adds, is that there is no legal distinction between human waste that has been separated at source, and combined wastewater flows that often come with greater safety concerns.\u00a0\nThere are other limitations too. Urine is heavy and cumbersome to transport,\u00a0and the lorries collecting and moving it create emissions. Currently the urine in Vermont is transported locally, no more than around 10 miles (16km). But expanding peecycling programmes could involve moving urine across bigger distances, so REI's spinoff company has developed a freeze concentration system that concentrates urine by six times, and is currently being used at the University of Michigan.\nCARBON COUNT\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nPlumbing, too, is a particular challenge. Love says that urine separation systems don't rely on flushing in the same way standard toilets do \u2013\u00a0which is great for reducing water use, but is problematic for the plumbing. When water doesn't flow through the system as usual, there is a risk of diseases\u00a0such as Legionnaires.\n\"There are solutions,\" Love says, \"like looped systems in a building. But what it means is the entire plumbing process in a building is different.\" This is something Love and her colleagues and partners are working on, so that new buildings in the US can have urine separation systems installed from the start. \"If we want any hope of sustainable water systems by the end of this century, we have to start getting the early adopters to look at these innovative solutions now,\" she says.\n\u00a0\nThese new systems will have the important goal of making urine donation effortless. Williams began her peecycling efforts using large laundry detergent bottles that travelled in the boot of her car to a central collection tank once a month. Once she was in the habit of collecting urine, Williams didn't like to let it go to waste. \"I didn't even like to go anywhere where I might have to pee and not have a jug with me. It kind of became part of my routine, sort of like wearing a seat belt,\" she says.\nEven so, she has enjoyed the recent installation of a toilet in her home that separates urine (at the front) from other waste (at the back). The urine travels to a tank in her basement, which is pumped out a couple of times each year by a lorry that visits Williams and others in her area that take part in the project. \"It's a nice change not dealing with the messy business of it. Making it easy for people is a biggie,\" Williams says.\nAvoiding mess is also likely to help tackle the \"ick factor\" when it comes to peecycling, says Williams. \"It's icky and it's smelly and it's something we don't talk about,\" she says. But while some may be put off by the idea of dealing with their own waste, REI's research suggests that the ick factor doesn't dominate people's reactions to peecycling. People tend to be open to the idea, Shupack says, but to think that others wouldn't be. \"It's this assumption that everyone else is going to think it's really gross. That initial ick factor is not as big of a deal as people assume it's going to be,\" says Shupack.\nMany people are, however, concerned about pharmaceutical content in the urine. \"It's the biggest question we get,\" Shupack says. REI has conducted research to find out just how much of common drugs like caffeine and the painkiller acetaminophen are evident in vegetables grown using urine fertiliser. The final results are yet to be released, but the preliminary findings suggest the amount of pharmaceuticals in vegetables fertilised with urine to be \"extremely small\". \"You'd have to eat a pretty obscene amount of lettuce, every day, for way longer than you can live\" to get a cup of coffee's worth of caffeine, Shupack says.\nHealth worries and messiness aside, Williams points out that it is our Western attitude to waste that most urgently needs to change. \"Particularly in [the US], people don't really think about where their waste goes. They think about it in terms of recycling and trash to some degree, but not so much in terms of human waste. It's a new frontier for people.\"\nClimate change and water pollution can feel like impossibly big issues, but Williams doesn't let them overwhelm her. Instead, she focuses on what she can do in a small way, in her own home. \"We can just do our part,\" she says. \"We aren't perfect, but we try to at least be responsible in terms of what happens to our bodily waste.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

Jodie Cunningham said it was evidence of the work English women's rugby league still has to do.\nEngland's experience in Las Vegas could hardly have been more chastening. A 90-4 defeat by Australia was the biggest the Lionesses - either as England or Great Britain - have ever suffered.\nBoth captain Cunningham and centre Hardcastle, interviewed on the pitch moments after a shattering result, were quick to pinpoint the reasons for it: they couldn't get enough of the ball, and so ended up spending much of the 70 minutes trying to defend against the best team in the world.\nHow to use that as a learning experience to avoid a repeat is a tougher question - and one that goes to the heart of the structure of women's rugby league in England.\nThe effort from Stuart Barrow's team never wavered, even as hopes of running their opponents close were shredded. The fact they scored the final try of the match, having conceded 17 before that, spoke volumes of their capacity to keep going.\nThat, in itself, required huge reserves of character.\n\"I think we know what we need to do when we go back home,\" Hardcastle said. \"You can't take anything away from the Jillaroos. \n\"They're absolute athletes and what they get to do in Australia, and how professional they are, and the backing that they get is incredible. And to face them at a top level, it's a privilege to be here.\n\"We've lost, but to be able to be here and give it a go and know what it's like in that battle, in that washing machine, it's been worth that 70 minutes.\"\nThe size of the defeat clearly hurt.\n\"There are always positives to take,\" Cunningham said. \"Right now, it's tough to focus on them, but I think the heart was there, the effort was there, we didn't give up. \n\"I think Georgia Roche getting a try for us right at the end shows that we didn't give up. The effort was there. It was just that they were too good for us. \n\"But I'm proud of the girls. I'm proud of how they kept going and sometimes that's what you've got to take at international rugby.\"\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nAustralia score 90 points against England in Las Vegas - as it happened\nJodie Cunningham acknowledged England did not have enough of the ball against Australia\nIn an interview with Sky Sports before the match, Cunningham had highlighted the gulf in investment between the women's domestic game in Australia and England.\nShe had pointed out how the players in the NRL Women's Premiership (NRLW) were either full-time or semi-professional, while those in England's Women's Super League play for expenses or nothing at all.\nThat gulf was on show at the Allegiant Stadium, as a ruthless Australia side kept on punishing their opponents.\nAnd it provided a significant reality check as England start building towards next year's World Cup.\n\"It shows where women's rugby league's at,\" Cunningham said. \"The growth that's happened over recent years, the investment that's gone into the NRLW is there to see, with the athletes they have and what you can see on show today. \n\"We've got a lot of work to do. But we've got a great squad, we've got a great group of staff and we're willing to put that hard work in to get better.\"\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sport, former Great Britain head coach Jackie Sheldon highlighted the investment Australia have put into their women's game over the past two decades as a key factor in their international dominance - they have won the past three World Cups, and lost just once since 2016.\nShe suggested England have to find a way to compete physically with Australia and New Zealand in order to be able to challenge them.\nGiven the disparity in investment between the domestic game in England and Australia, that may not be a quick process. It may be helped, though, by the experience gained by English players who have moved to the NRLW: Roche plays her club rugby for Newcastle Knights, and Hollie-Mae Dodd for Canberra Raiders, while Paige Travis will start the coming season with Parramatta Eels, having switched from St Helens.\nPerhaps, in time, the painful memories of Vegas will make England better too. As Hardcastle put it: \"The result's hard, but there's a lot we can look at individually, and think: what do we need to do to be better?\"",

The fact they scored the final try of the match, having conceded 17 before that, spoke volumes of their capacity to keep going.\nThat, in itself, required huge reserves of character.\n\"I think we know what we need to do when we go back home,\" Hardcastle said. \"You can't take anything away from the Jillaroos. \n\"They're absolute athletes and what they get to do in Australia, and how professional they are, and the backing that they get is incredible.

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.Nicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides.

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nThe 21-year-old, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nEdie points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nAlso involved in the film was Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance.\nShe says Madison installed a pole at her house in LA, and the pair began working on her \"sexy routine\".\n\"She put in so much work,\" Schneider, 28, said. \"She was so determined.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Schneider, meanwhile, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump hit the pause button in February on imposing tariffs against imports from Canada and Mexico, suspending a tit-for-tat trade war in North America for a month by signing last-minute agreements with both US neighbours.\nThat month ends this week, and Trump has said the US will charge 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico starting on Tuesday. Consumers in all three countries are now bracing for what will happen next.\nThe three trade partners have deeply integrated economies and supply chains, with an estimated $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.\nTrump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US. \nThat's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.\nSo what could get more expensive if Trump's tariffs do eventually go ahead?\nCars would probably go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.\nThat's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled. \nAs a result of higher taxes paid on the importing of parts to build the cars, it is likely the costs will be passed on to customers.\n\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said Andrew Foran, an economist at TD Economics.\nHe added \"uninterrupted free trade\" in the car-making sector had \"existed for decades\", which had led to lower prices for consumers.\n\nPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.\nHowever, it's also possible that rather than passing on the cost increase, firms could just import less.\nModelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now. \nIt's more complex when it comes to spirits. The sector has been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\". \nThey say that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".\nSo given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. The trade bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in all three countries.\nThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material would be hit by Trump's suggested tariffs. Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".\nHowever, the National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".\nThe industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.\n\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.\nIt's not just lumber from Canada that could be affected by tariffs. \nThere is now a second threat looming for most lumber and timber imports into the US, regardless of their country of origin. \nOn 1 March Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should either place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production. Findings are due towards the end of the year.\nWhen it comes to the trade war with Canada, the \"most obvious\" household impact would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics.\nCanada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.\nThe majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\n\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.\n\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but that are produced using inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada.\nWhile 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.\nNow the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.\n\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nThat means if Canada decided in retaliation to any US tariffs to reduce crude oil exports, that could lead to prices rising at the petrol pumps. \nOne food import that American consumers could see a significant price increase in is avocados. \nGrown primarily in Mexico due to its warm, humid climate, Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year. \nHowever, if tariffs come into force, the US Agriculture Department has warned that the cost of avocados - along with popular avocado-based dishes like guacamole - could surge.\nBefore Trump's agreement with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to pause tariffs was announced, Canada had threatened retaliatory import taxes worth C$155bn ($107bn; \u00a384bn).\nAn initial C$30bn tranche is due to begin the day after the tariffs are implemented - meaning prices would probably increase for consumers north of the border as well.\nOttawa has released a list of all the US imports that would have immediately been targeted with matching 25% tariffs. They included grocery store staples, like oranges - a produce that Canada cannot grow in abundance due to its cooler climate.\nAhead of Trump's first tariff announcement, provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia also said they would pull all American booze off their shelves.\nAny US alcohol - including beer and wine - that Canadians could find would likely see a price increase, as it's on the menu for retaliatory tariffs.\nCanadian shoppers might feel the pinch from a weaker Canadian dollar if shopping online. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Acheson and Nadine Yousif",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Was it pruning or felling? \nThe alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.\nThe chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.\nThe trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.\nBut rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. \n\"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,\" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.\nThe project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000\u20137,000 still left to be mapped.\nDespite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.\nThis is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.\nBut on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.\nThe trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.\nThe Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected \"pleasure gardens\" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. \nThe chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.\nAccording to government literature,  in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. \nEmperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.\nInterestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.   \nBut environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.\n\"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,\" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.\n\"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,\" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.\nChinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.\nGovernment projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.\nLast week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.\n\"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,\" Mr Bhat says. \n\"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.\"",

        "article_text": "Barry Ferguson suffered defeat in his home debut as Rangers head coach\n\"It's not good enough.\" \nNot the words Rangers interim head coach Barry Ferguson might have expected to be saying in the aftermath of his return to Ibrox, this time in charge, after the departure of Philippe Clement.\nOff the back of a rousing 4-2 fightback win at Kilmarnock in his first outing, this was set up to be a positive homecoming, during which captain James Tavernier made his 500th appearance for the club.\nYou could feel that pre-match. Like a weight had been lifted. Yet it went horribly wrong - again. \nMotherwell win to ruin Ferguson's Ibrox return\nCeltic thump five past St Mirren to extend Premiership lead\nRangers stumbled to a third straight defeat at Ibrox. Queens Park, St Mirren and now Motherwell, by 2-1, all victorious. Unthinkable and certainly unpalatable for the Rangers support as they, once again, demonstrated at full-time. \nAt least the minority that remained at Ibrox come that point. Certainly \"not good enough\".\nRangers are now 16 points behind Celtic with nine games remaining. They have either lost or drawn almost 38% of their league fixtures. \nFerguson looked increasingly agonised by a tepid, lacklustre display during which Motherwell took full advantage to earn a fantastic win, just their second in 61 league meetings between these sides.\nIt would be incredibly harsh to lay blame at Ferguson's feet, but the short-lived honeymoon seems over already. \nThe former Rangers captain has some serious issues to address - and quickly - as this squad looks increasingly unreliable, domestically at least.\n\"There's obviously a clear problem in terms of playing at home and that's something me as a manager and my staff and the players need to sit down and really get to the bottom of,\" Ferguson said.\nWorryingly for him, Ibrox was the one source of solace for much of this season as domestic away form deserted Rangers under Clement until late in his tenure. That home comfort has now imploded. \nSo what is the issue? \n\"There's good players here, I've seen it,\" Ferguson continued. \"Technically, very good. To play at Rangers, they need to be mentally strong. The fans demand that of you.\"\nOn this evidence, the mentality has been shredded. Experienced goalkeeper Jack Butland was culpable for the opener with a poor reaction save to allow Luke Armstrong to net the opener. His confidence looks diminished, as it does in many of his team-mates.\nThey were brutally exposed by some fine play from Motherwell for the second. \nMore concerning for Ferguson was the lack of energy throughout. It rarely felt that Rangers would go on and mount a winning comeback. \nThey cannot possibly win silverware, other than in Europe, where they face a stiff last 16 first-leg test away to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbache on Thursday. \nWill the Europa League version of this Jekyll and Hyde Rangers turn up again?\n\"Well, that's what happens when you play at Rangers,\" Ferguson explained.\n\"European football's great. It's great to be involved in. It's great financially for the club, but your bread and butter is domestic trophies. \n\"Domestically, the form has to be better. Europe's always been a bonus. It's brilliant to go and pit your wits against really good teams and really good managers and really good players, but what matters? Domestic football for me.\"\nRangers will hope that bonus of European form continues as their domestic season lies in tatters.\nIt was another painful home defeat for the home supporters, who must have hoped the familiar face of Ferguson in charge would bring short-term relief and steady the ship. It has not.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.\nThe ICO's investigations into Reddit and Imgur will focus on how the platforms check the ages of their users and their enforcement of age checks.\nOfcom said in October Reddit had overtaken X as the UK's fifth most popular platform.\nImgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month.   However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK. \n\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC. \n\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites. \n\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"\nA Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".\nImgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.\nThe investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law. \nBut companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.\n\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.\nIt is not the first time TikTok has faced scrutiny from the ICO.  The platform is appealing against an ICO fine of \u00a312.7m in 2023 for misusing children's data issued in 2023. ",

After escaping with a draw despite a woeful first 70 minutes at Everton last Saturday, 48 hours later chief executive Omar Berrada was telling staff up to 200 jobs could go in a second round of redundancies.\nIt took a backs-to-the-wall second-half display against relegation-threatened Ipswich on Wednesday to claim a vital Premier League win after more defensive mistakes and Patrick Dorgu's red card threatened a sixth home defeat of Amorim's short reign.\nThe Portuguese says life is \"hard\" just now - but remains convinced better times lie ahead.\n\"I see a clear path, and I see that from the board also,\" he said in the build-up to Sunday's home FA Cup fifth-round tie against Fulham. \"They are also doing difficult changes.\n\"They are not popular but they are doing it because they have a vision. In the future we need to show some results. You can do a lot of changes but if you don't have results, people don't feel confident and happy.\n\"The good thing is we have a clear path. Now [it] is hard but we are doing things to achieve success in the future.\"\nUnited's inconsistency puts even more focus on the two cup competitions they remain in - they face Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday - as it appears increasingly likely winning one of them is the only way they will qualify for European football next season.\nThe issues he is facing are so extensive, Amorim could be forgiven for wishing he had stuck to his initial demand not to leave Sporting until the end of the season.\nHowever, he does think dealing with so many problems has made him a more rounded coach.\n\"Better [coach] is hard to say, because I am not winning games,\" he said. \"But in three months here, I live certain things that I think make me a more complete manager.\n\"Sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow. I am not going to die if I lose three games in a row. I learned that here. I can cope and maintain my energy.

Prosecutors said the child had been stabbed 26 times. He died from the injuries shortly after the attack.\nPolice testified that they found Czuba outside the house after the attack, with blood on his body and hands.\nLawyers for Czuba defended him by arguing that pieces of evidence linking him to the crimes were missing. His ex-wife testified in the trial, and said he rarely had violent outbursts in their 30-year marriage.\nBut jurors found him guilty of the crimes after a short deliberation. Czuba faces life in prison without parole.

Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show.

Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT.

        "article_text": "Stars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.\nSpanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.\nWicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.\nUS comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).\nYou can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.\nHere are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).\nIt is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar. They are shortlisted for best animated feature for their latest outing, Vengeance Most Fowl.\nRead more about this year's awards season films:",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.\nHis sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.\nA tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. \nIf you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.\nOne of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. \nDuring what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nThe exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nIt escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be \"thankful\" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" \nThe Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.\nIn a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" \n\"He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" Trump said.\nAhead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. \nZelensky had said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. \nNotably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nBut Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.\nTrump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. \nA big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \nOn the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for \"a significant reduction\" in their staff by 13 March.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.\nTrump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter the meeting, Macron said Trump had \"good reason\" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. \nTrump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nPart way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nTrump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.\nThe clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the \"riviera\" of the Middle East.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (\u00a3792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. \nOfficials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.\nTrump unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (\u00a33.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\nThe president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to \"high-level people\".\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. \nIt includes $4.5 trillion (\u00a33.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.\nHowever, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.\nTrump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.\n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.",

        "article_text": "Anora was the big winner at the Oscars, winning five awards including best actress for breakout star Mikey Madison, and a record-breaking four prizes for its director Sean Baker.\nThe whirlwind drama stars relative newcomer Madison as a New York stripper who falls in love with the son of a wealthy Russian.\nShe held off competition from Demi Moore, and described winning the best actress Oscar as a \"dream come true\".\nBaker became the first person to personally win four Academy Awards for a single film - for directing, editing, writing and producing Anora.\nOther winners on the night included Kieran Culkin, Adrien Brody and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, while Flow won best animated film and I'm Still Here took home the best international prize.\nIn her speech, 25-year-old Madison said: \"This is very surreal. I grew up in Los Angeles but Hollywood always felt so far away from me, so to be here standing in this room today is really incredible.\"\nShe added: \"I want to honour and recognise the sex worker community. I will continue to support and be an ally... the women I've had the privilege of meeting from that community has been one of the highlights of this entire incredible experience.\"\nThe best director trophy was presented by Quentin Tarantino, who previously cast Madison in a small role in his film Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.\nAccepting the trophy from Tarantino, Baker told him: \"If you didn't cast Mikey Madison... there'd be no Anora.\"\nBaker went on to thank the Academy voters for \"recognising a truly independent film\", and used his best director speech to champion cinemas.\n\"Where did we fall in love with movies? At the movie theatres,\" Baker said. \"Watching a film in a theatre with an audience is an experience.\n\"And at a time when the world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever, it's a communal experience you just don't get at home.\n\"Right now the theatre-going experience is under threat, independently owned theatres are struggling, and it's up to us to support them.\"\nHe concluded: \"This is my battle cry: Film-makers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will. Distributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of my films.\"\nBaker is the first person to win four Oscars for a single film. Walt Disney did win four prizes in a single night in 1953, but for four different films. \nThe Brutalist's Adrien Brody was named best actor for his performance as a Hungarian-Jewish architect who moves to the US after World War Two to build a new life. \nBrody had not been nominated at the Oscars since 2003, when he became the youngest ever winner of best actor for The Pianist. \n\"Acting is a very fragile profession,\" he said. \"It looks very glamorous, and in certain moments it is, but the one thing I've gained in having the privilege to come back here is to have some perspective.\n\"And no matter where you are in your career, no matter what you've accomplished, it can all go away. And what makes this night so special is the awareness of that, and the gratitude I have to still do the work that I love.\"\nBrody refused to be played off during his five-minute speech, continuing: \"I'm here once again to represent the lingering traumas and repercussions of war, and systematic oppression, and antisemitism and racism.\n\"And I pray for a healthier, happier and more inclusive world. And I believe if the past can teach us anything, it's a reminder to not let hate go unchecked.\"\nThe Brutalist also scored two British wins - best cinematography for Lol Crawley, who grew up in Wales, and best original score for composer Daniel Blumberg.\nZoe Salda\u00f1a was named best supporting actress for her performance in Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a drug lord who changes gender.\n\"I am floored by this honour,\" she said in an emotional acceptance speech. \"Thank you to the Academy for recognising the quiet heroism and the power in a woman like Rita,\" referring to her character.\n\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961,\" she added, \"I am a proud child of immigrant parents, and I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last.\"\nEmilia P\u00e9rez also won best original song for El Mal, a song performed by Salda\u00f1a in the film.\nSuccession star Kieran Culkin was named best supporting actor, a category he has dominated throughout awards season. \nThe actor won for his performance in A Real Pain, about two cousins who travel across Poland in remembrance of their grandmother. \nIn his acceptance speech, he said: \"I have no idea how I got here, I've just been acting my whole life, it's just been a part of what I do.\"\nHe thanked the film's writer and director Jesse Eisenberg, telling him: \"Thank you for this movie, you're a genius. I'd never say that to your face, I'll never say it again, so soak it up.\"\nCulkin also paid tribute to his Succession co-star Jeremy Strong, who was nominated in the same category.\nThe Oscars came two months after wildfires devastated Los Angeles. The ceremony opened with a montage of film clips featuring shots of the city, concluding with the slogan: \"We love LA.\"\nLater in the ceremony, a group of Los Angeles firefighters were invited on to the stage in recognition of their service, receiving a standing ovation from the audience. \nElsewhere, Wicked received best production design and best costume design, with Paul Tazewell becoming the first black man ever to receive the latter. \n\"I'm so proud of this,\" he said in his acceptance speech. He thanked \"everyone in the UK [where Wicked was filmed] for all of your beautiful work, I could not have done this without you\".\nAnother box office blockbuster, Dune: Part Two, also won two awards - best sound and best visual effects. \nBafta winner Conclave took home just one prize - best adapted screenplay.\nThe film's British screenwriter Peter Straughan paid tribute to the writer of the novel the film is based on, saying: \"Thank you Robert Harris for your beautiful book, we're all standing on your shoulders.\"\nElsewhere at the ceremony, Morgan Freeman paid tribute to his \"dear friend\" Gene Hackman, whose death was announced last week. \n\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer, and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said. \nOther winners included The Substance, for best make-up and hairstyling, and Flow, which won best animated film.\nMeanwhile, In The Shadow of the Cypress was named best animated short. \nIts Iranian directors Shirin Sohani and Hossein Molayemi accepted the prize just three hours after their plane landed in Los Angeles, following difficulties obtaining a US visa. \nI'm Still Here, a film about the true story of a Brazilian woman who investigates the disappearance of her congressman husband, was named best international film. \nThe best documentary award went to No Other Land, a collaboration between Palestinian and Israeli film-makers about the ongoing conflict in the region. \n\"We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together, our voices are stronger,\" said co-director Yuval Abraham.\nAlso during the ceremony, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande sang a Wicked medley, while Raye, Liza from Blackpink, Doja Cat and Margaret Qualley all performed as part of a James Bond tribute.",

There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the Netherlands supports Ukraine \"now more than ever\", adding: \"We want a lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression started by Russia. For Ukraine and its people, and for Europe.\"\nGermany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\".\nGermany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the \"unspeakable\" row resembled a \"bad dream\" and \"underlined that a new age of infamy has begun\". \nShe said she would \"wholeheartedly push\" for measures that could help Ukraine \"withstand Russia's aggression even if the US withdraws support, so that it can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation\".\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: \"Ukraine, Spain stands with you,\" while his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk wrote: \"Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.\"\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada \"will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace\".\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted that his country had \"proudly supported the brave people of Ukraine in their struggle to defend their sovereignty against the brutality of Russian aggression and in support of international law\".\nEuropean Union chiefs Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen assured Zelensky in a joint statement that he was \"never alone\".\n\"We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace,\" they said.\nThere were also supportive messages for Ukraine from political leaders in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia.\nHowever, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced his support for Trump, writing: \"Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr President!\"\nOn Saturday, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told the BBC he had spoken with Zelensky twice following the White House meeting.\nHe said he was \"not at liberty to say what was discussed\" but shared that he told Zelensky \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.\nHe said Zelensky must \"find a way\" to restore his relationship with his US counterpart. \nZelensky left the White House early following his row with Trump - but afterwards thanked the US president on social media for his support, saying: \"Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\nWriting on messenger app Telegram on Saturday, Zelensky said it was \"very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after\".\n\"It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world,\" he added.\nIn an interview with Fox News following his White House visit, Zelensky said his row with Trump was \"not good for both sides\" but he thought the relationship could be salvaged.\nThe pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals.\nFriday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\nZelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous 2019 ceasefire deal that was agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for a summit \"without delay\" between the US, Europe and allies on Ukraine.\nSir Keir's crunch talks at Downing Street on Sunday will see European leaders gear up efforts to police a future Ukraine peace deal.\nThe UK prime minister believes a deal will have to involve US military assets providing surveillance, intelligence and potentially warplanes giving air cover to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise L\u00fcbeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot \u2013 a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nButtler on 'right time for me' to leave England captaincy\nThe end came quicker than anyone expected.\nJust six months ago England coach Brendon McCullum backed Jos Buttler to the hilt despite questions over his captain's future.\nEven after defeat by Afghanistan, most thought the decision would be made after the flight home. Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket. Were England to find a way, their rebuild could gain a jump start.",

Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.England's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'Published1 day agoEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgeryPublished23 hours agoTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captainFind a new captainThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.Harry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.But appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.There is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.McCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. \"Fix the need for speedThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.Mark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.If, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.Wood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.That he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket.

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "Some people seek fame or infamy on social media, while others find themselves embroiled in a storm of unsolicited and often vitriolic comments. This happened to a Cambridge University academic - but how has being in the spotlight affected her?\nA photo of Dr Ally Louks and her completed PhD thesis, posted to X in November 2024, attracted viral fame when it was viewed more than 120 million times - and the numbers have risen steadily since then.\nAmong the congratulations and interest in her subject - \"the politics of smell\" - were many disturbing comments, mysogynistic, accusatory and personally threatening.\nReflecting on the experience three months on, she says: \"This has undoubtedly changed my life... and while I would not wish this on anyone, it has given me a platform to speak positively about academia and research.\"\nDr Louks, a supervisor in English Literature at the university, is a self-confessed introvert and rarely used social media before posting her photo - which was mainly intended for her friends - on X.\nHer subject - \"Olfactory Ethics: The politics of smell in modern and contemporary prose\" - explored \"why certain writers of the past century use the language associated with smell to characterise harmful attitudes towards objects of disgust and desire\".\n\"I draw on the well-documented history of olfactory prejudice in order to examine its contemporary relevance,\" she says.\nFor example, her work looked at Hitler's claims about the smell of Jewish people in his book Mein Kampf, and how descriptions of the transatlantic slave trade were also used \"to legitimize racism\".\nHer seemingly innocent post attracted a number of abusive comments from people who believed women should stay out of academia and those who did not understand her work, and were \"under-informed or indeed uninformed\", as she puts it.\nThe comments included threats of rape and death.\nWithin about 36 hours of her post, the haters got on board.\n\"It was pretty all-consuming for the first week,\" she says. \n\"Replies were coming in far faster than I could read them, so I wasn't sleeping much in an attempt to keep up with the conversation. \n\"I won't pretend that it was pleasant to have people saying unkind things, but the critiques were ultimately quite baseless as they were based on the title and abstract of my thesis alone or were downright misogynistic. \n\"It never caused me to question the value or validity of my work. I tried to approach the situation with openness and intellectual curiosity, because there was some valid scepticism, and I've relished the opportunity to prove the worth of my work among the public audience that I've been gifted.\"\nDr Louks says she tried to approach the attention - both good and bad - in a positive way - and would advise anyone else to do the same.\n\"The positive comments I received significantly outweighed the negatives, but the negative ones were liked and shared which boosted them to the top of my feed.\n\"I refused to engage with anyone who was aggressive or insulting but I did respond to some people who were sceptical or just didn't understand my work.

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.Nicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win.

        "article_text": "Ukraine's president had been hoping to leave the White House on Friday after positive talks with Donald Trump, capped with the signing of a minerals deal giving the US a real stake in his country's future, if not an outright security guarantee.\nInstead Volodymyr Zelensky faced an extraordinary dressing down in front of the world's media, after President Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance demanded that he show more gratitude for years of US support.\nThe Ukrainian president pushed back at suggestions from his more powerful partners that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. They responded that he was being \"disrespectful\".\nZelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early before he and Trump could even take the stage for a scheduled news conference.\nAnd the minerals deal, which had been trailed and praised by both sides this week, was left unsigned. \"Come back when you're ready for peace,\" Trump wrote on social media shortly before Zelensky's car pulled away.\nThere were several major flashpoints in the meeting. Here are four of the most fiery - and the politics and feeling that lies behind them.\nWhile there was half an hour of cordial talks and formalities at the start, tensions began to boil over in the Oval Office when Vance said the \"path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy\".\n\"That's what President Trump is doing,\" he said.\nZelensky interjected, referencing Russia's aggression in the years before its full-scale invasion three years ago including a failed ceasefire in 2019. \"Nobody stopped him,\" he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you talking about? What do you mean?\" he said. \nThe exchange then became visibly tense, with Vance replying: \"the kind that will end the destruction of your country.\"\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the American media.\nIt was Vance's defence of Trump's approach to ending the war - by opening communications with Putin and pushing for a quick ceasefire - that first escalated tensions with the Ukrainian leader.\nAfter Vance challenged the Ukrainian president over problems he's had with the military and conscription, Zelensky replied: \"During the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have a nice ocean and don't feel [it] now, but you will feel it in the future.\"\nThat comment rankled Trump and drew him into the clash that up until this point had been limited to Zelensky and the vice-president.\nHere was the Ukrainian leader suggesting Trump had failed to grasp the moral hazard of dealing with the war's aggressor.\nZelensky's message cut to the heart of what critics say is Trump's fundamental miscalculation in dealing with Russia. That by ending Moscow's isolation and seeking a quick ceasefire he risks emboldening Putin, weakening Europe and leaving Ukraine open to being devoured.\nTrump tends to characterise the war as a kind of binary conflict between two sides who should both take their share of burden or blame for the fighting and its causes.\nBut Zelensky was trying to warn of catastrophic consequences of this thinking. This was the Ukrainian leader directly telling Trump in the Oval Office: Appease Russia, and the war will come to you.\nIt triggered Trump's biggest backlash. \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel. You're in no position to dictate that,\" he said, his voice getting louder.\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" he told him. \"You're gambling with millions of lives.\"\nThis exchange may win Zelensky plaudits among those who wanted to see him to stand up to Trump; but this moment could also decide an era of war and peace in Europe.\nAt one point later in the conversation, Zelensky said: \"From the very beginning of the war, we have been alone and we are thankful.\"\nThis angered Trump, who has repeatedly framed the war as a drain on American taxpayers.\n\"You haven't been alone,\" he said. \"You haven't been alone. We gave you - through this stupid president - $350bn,\" Trump said, a reference to Biden.\nVance then asked whether Zelensky had thanked the US during the meeting and accused him of campaigning \"for the opposition\" - the Democrats - during the US election last year.\nThe comment was a reference to a visit Zelensky made to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania - Joe Biden's hometown - just weeks before Americans headed to the polls in the November election.\nRepublicans were outraged at the visit, accusing Zelensky of turning the tour into a partisan campaign event on Kamala Harris's behalf in a battleground state.\nHere was all the bitter division of America's own polarised internal politics pouring into the room at a critical moment for future of global security.\n\"Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war,\" Zelensky began saying, only for Trump to cut him off.\n\"He's not speaking loudly,\" Trump shot back, visibly irritated. \"Your country's in big trouble.\"\n\"You're not winning, you're not winning this,\" Trump said. \"You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.\"\n\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" said Trump. \"It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change.\"\nThe president and vice-president reprimanded Zelensky, appearing most angered by what they perceived as his \"attitude\". \n\"Just say thank you,\" Vance demanded at one point.\nZelensky's responses - which were to fact check the two far more powerful men and argue his corner - seemed driven by the existential nature of this moment. \nHe has spent three years defending his country from invasion, while also trying to hold together a society and its political leadership that Putin has tried to drive apart. \nBut out of the main camera shot was another sight in the room. Zelensky's  ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, who was spotted with her head in her hands as the arguments escalated. \nIt is an image that sums up the diplomatic position for Zelensky and his relationship with - until now at least - his superpower sponsor in trying to repel Russia. \nStanding up to Trump like he did on Friday could, ultimately, mean losing to Putin.",

At least 16 helicopters are also being used, with images showing the aircraft dumping water onto the smouldering hills.\nLike many other countries, Japan in 2024 recorded its hottest year since records began.\nIt is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened specific fires, because other factors - such as changes to the way land is used - are also relevant. \nHowever, the IPCC says climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely.\nHave you been evacuated?

At least 16 helicopters are also being used, with images showing the aircraft dumping water onto the smouldering hills.Like many other countries, Japan in 2024 recorded its hottest year since records began.It is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened specific fires, because other factors - such as changes to the way land is used - are also relevant. However, the IPCC says climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely.Have you been evacuated?

        "article_text": "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.\nIt came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients every day. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.\nThat meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.\nNHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.\nUnder Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.\nAmanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.\nThe first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.\nOne well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".\nAnother clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the work.\nAt the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.\nAmanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.\nNHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.\nIn January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.\nShe will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.\nSo where does all this leave the NHS?\nOn one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.\nBut on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.\nOne health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.\nMuch will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.\nIt's patients that matter - and it's not yet clear whether or not these changes will help them.",

It's absolutely amazing,\" Hannah said. \nBass player Emer McLaughlin was equally thrilled at the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\"I'm so incredibly excited and honoured to be supporting giants Snow Patrol in the SSE Arena.\n\"This has been a literal dream come true for us as an upcoming band in so many ways.\n\"It's such a landmark venue - it's our first ever arena show - and to be supporting a fellow Irish band like Snow Patrol just makes it such an unbelievable experience.\"\nThe members of CHERYM say that when it comes to the music industry they, like many other young bands, need as much exposure as possible in order to progress in a very competitive industry. \n\"This is probably the biggest level of exposure we've ever had,\" says Alannagh.\nAlthough CHERYM are signed to a small independent record label called Alcopop Records, who they say are so artist-friendly, Alannagh says it is \"extremely difficult\" to make a name for yourself.\n\"I saw an article by Sam Fender where he was speaking about the music industry very recently and how ninety per cent of it are people who come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds.\n\"Whereas for a working-class band it is very, very difficult to do that.\"\nAlannagh explained that CHERYM's members rely on funding and other support \"to actually be able to pay our petrol money on the way home and to be able to make a living out of this\".\n\"Some of us have full time jobs in order to make this work,\" she said.\n\"So we have to have a second job in order to pursue our actual passion.\"\nThe band are delighted that Lightbody likes their music and described the support from Snow Patrol's members as \"very reassuring\".\nCHERYM have also toured with The Undertones and say it was an experience they will never forget as the popular Derry band took them under their wing.\nThey even got to perform the famous anthem Teenage Kicks live on stage with them.\n\"It was so fun. They were like Derry das on tour,\" says Alannagh.\n\"Everybody was sitting together to have dinner before the show and they invited us up on stage to play Teenage Kicks with them which was extremely exciting.\"\nSpeaking before the Belfast show, Hannah said she was extremely nervous about playing support to Snow Patrol but would \"love every minute\".\nDuring the gig, Lightbody dedicated Snow Patrol's performance of Chasing Cars to the band's support acts CHERYM and Nina Nesbitt.",

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise L\u00fcbeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot \u2013 a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The crime scene was a bloodbath. The victim, stabbed multiple times, had tried to defend himself. In the process, the suspect is also thought to have lost blood.\nThe attacker is still at large. \n\"It's quite a frustrating case,\" says Jo Ward, crime scene coordinator at West Midlands Police, \"because I don't actually think I've had a case that has not been solved in my 27 years, so it doesn't sit right with me.\"\nJo has dealt with more than 50 murders, and is determined to track down the killer of her only unsolved case - an investigation featured in the new BBC series of Forensics: The Real CSI.\nOn 9 February 2022, Jo was called to investigate the murder of a Chinese national, Jinming Zhang, 41, in a flat in Digbeth, Birmingham.\nIt quickly became apparent that the flat was being used as a brothel and the only witness to the brutal murder was a young Chinese woman who had hid from the killer. \nOriginally the motive was thought to have been robbery - drawers on a bedside table had been pulled out and the property searched. But this could not be confirmed.\nAs crime scene coordinator, Jo was first on the scene, combing the property for evidence. Throughout the investigation, she worked alongside other specialists, such as blood pattern analysts and CCTV coordinators to try to piece together everything that happened that night.\nPolice believe the murder suspect may have sustained a hand injury in the frenzied attack.\nBlood pattern analysis, a technique used to interpret the bloodstains at the crime scene, helped to determine which of the blood spots in the flat may have belonged to the victim and which could have been the killer's.\nA blood trail was detected leading away from the property, and hours of CCTV footage was analysed to track the killer's escape route.\nThe suspect was a black man, between 5ft 2in (1.6m) and 5ft 5in (1.7m) tall and of slim build.

But now, anything that has been in contact with the lips and saliva can also be swabbed to provide a DNA profile, says Jo, such as cans, bottles of drinks and, increasingly, vapes. \nCellular DNA can also be found when someone has simply touched an item, says Jo.\n\"Obviously when we have murders or sexual assaults, we're always looking at [whether] the item of clothing [has] been gripped by the offender at all during the assault. It's about targeting those areas to then see if you can obtain the DNA from that.\"\nBut while techniques have improved, getting answers is not always as fast as Jo would like.\n\"It's not like your CSI Miami,\" says Jo, \"where they get a DNA and literally within an hour they get results.\"\nShe is hopeful the identification process will speed up in the future.\n\"Obviously fingerprints have always been around and we recover them with powder and send them in,\" says Jo. \"I think digitally there will be something that comes up in the future where it's a simple, take a photo, scan straightway, and it'll be a quicker turnaround on identification.\"\nWalking into so many murder scenes over the years has had an impact on Jo. She gets the same feelings of apprehension approaching every scene, with butterflies in her stomach.\n\"Sometimes I feel sick after I've come out and not wanting to eat, but I've really got a mindset now where I think: 'Ok I can't change what's happened but what I can do is my utmost to then identify the person responsible and get justice for the victim and the family.'\"\nJo suffered with PTSD after a murder investigation in the past, which she says taught her a lot. To avoid a recurrence, she tries not to get emotionally attached.\n\"I think that's the mistake I made when I had my PTSD, that I was looking at all the family photographs,\" says Jo.\n\"It's a tough job but it's also a very rewarding job when you get that result and you identify the suspect and they get charged.\"\nWhen it comes to her only unsolved case, Jo is hoping someone will come forward after watching the programme and remember something that could lead to the identification of the suspect.\nShe also has a message for the killer: \"We need to get justice for the victim and the family. Do the right thing and come forward.\"\nForensics: The Real CSI - Murder in a Brothel is on Sunday 2 March at 21:00 GMT on BBC Two and from 06:00 GMT on BBC iPlayer\nDetails of help and support for victims of crime are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

I don't know how long it will take. We have a goal and we continue forward no matter what.\"\nWorking as a pundit for Match of the Day, Rooney's reaction to those comments was that Amorim should focus more on short-term aims that might keep him in his job.\n\"I think it's a little naive to say they're looking to win the Premier League because from where they are now, they're a long way off that,\" he said.\n\"I think he'll get time but it's not a free hit because he'll expect more from Manchester United than what we're seeing since he's been in. He says winning the Premier League, how can they compete? To get further up the table, I think that's the next step for them.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'The goal is to win the Premier League'\nRooney's comments about United carry huge weight given his achievements at the club.\nHe remains United's record goalscorer and won five league titles and the Champions League during a stellar period in which he was a central figure in Ferguson's last great side.\nHowever, he has a chequered record as a manager, initially doing well in a difficult situation at Derby, moving to Major League Soccer with DC United, but then lasting just 15 and 25 games in ill-fated spells at Birmingham and Plymouth.\nAmorim did not mention this when he responded to Rooney's comments. But, from personal experience, he knows talking about a team and managing one is two entirely different things.\n\"That (winning the Premier League) is the goal,\" said Amorim. \"To be naive is to think we are going to do it this season or be the best contender next season.\n\"I know in this moment, everybody knows everything. I was a pundit when I finished my [playing] career. I know it's really easy.\n\"Maybe it is not with me but our goal, as a club, is to win the Premier League like we did in the past with all the great glories and legends of this club.\n\"We are in a difficult moment.

        "article_text": "Barry Ferguson suffered defeat in his home debut as Rangers head coach\n\"It's not good enough.\" \nNot the words Rangers interim head coach Barry Ferguson might have expected to be saying in the aftermath of his return to Ibrox, this time in charge, after the departure of Philippe Clement.\nOff the back of a rousing 4-2 fightback win at Kilmarnock in his first outing, this was set up to be a positive homecoming, during which captain James Tavernier made his 500th appearance for the club.\nYou could feel that pre-match. Like a weight had been lifted. Yet it went horribly wrong - again. \nMotherwell win to ruin Ferguson's Ibrox return\nCeltic thump five past St Mirren to extend Premiership lead\nRangers stumbled to a third straight defeat at Ibrox. Queens Park, St Mirren and now Motherwell, by 2-1, all victorious. Unthinkable and certainly unpalatable for the Rangers support as they, once again, demonstrated at full-time. \nAt least the minority that remained at Ibrox come that point. Certainly \"not good enough\".\nRangers are now 16 points behind Celtic with nine games remaining. They have either lost or drawn almost 38% of their league fixtures. \nFerguson looked increasingly agonised by a tepid, lacklustre display during which Motherwell took full advantage to earn a fantastic win, just their second in 61 league meetings between these sides.\nIt would be incredibly harsh to lay blame at Ferguson's feet, but the short-lived honeymoon seems over already. \nThe former Rangers captain has some serious issues to address - and quickly - as this squad looks increasingly unreliable, domestically at least.\n\"There's obviously a clear problem in terms of playing at home and that's something me as a manager and my staff and the players need to sit down and really get to the bottom of,\" Ferguson said.\nWorryingly for him, Ibrox was the one source of solace for much of this season as domestic away form deserted Rangers under Clement until late in his tenure. That home comfort has now imploded. \nSo what is the issue? \n\"There's good players here, I've seen it,\" Ferguson continued. \"Technically, very good. To play at Rangers, they need to be mentally strong. The fans demand that of you.\"\nOn this evidence, the mentality has been shredded. Experienced goalkeeper Jack Butland was culpable for the opener with a poor reaction save to allow Luke Armstrong to net the opener. His confidence looks diminished, as it does in many of his team-mates.\nThey were brutally exposed by some fine play from Motherwell for the second. \nMore concerning for Ferguson was the lack of energy throughout. It rarely felt that Rangers would go on and mount a winning comeback. \nThey cannot possibly win silverware, other than in Europe, where they face a stiff last 16 first-leg test away to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbache on Thursday. \nWill the Europa League version of this Jekyll and Hyde Rangers turn up again?\n\"Well, that's what happens when you play at Rangers,\" Ferguson explained.\n\"European football's great. It's great to be involved in. It's great financially for the club, but your bread and butter is domestic trophies. \n\"Domestically, the form has to be better. Europe's always been a bonus. It's brilliant to go and pit your wits against really good teams and really good managers and really good players, but what matters? Domestic football for me.\"\nRangers will hope that bonus of European form continues as their domestic season lies in tatters.\nIt was another painful home defeat for the home supporters, who must have hoped the familiar face of Ferguson in charge would bring short-term relief and steady the ship. It has not.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

        "article_text": "The Brit Awards belonged to Charli XCX on Saturday night, who completed her transformation from underground hero to bona fide pop star by winning five awards including best artist and song of the year.\nEzra Collective, Sam Fender, Stormzy and The Last Dinner Party were the other big British winners on Saturday night, while Fontaines DC and Chappell Roan bagged the international awards. \nThe night also included a memorable, blush-inducing performance from US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter, who was handed the global success award at London's O2 Arena.\nThe arena fell silent near the end of the show for a moving video tribute to the late Liam Payne, who died last October.\nDespite not performing, Charli XCX stole the show by winning the biggest awards of the night - artist of the year, album of the year for her cultural phenomenon Brat, and song of the year for Guess.\n\"This is cool, I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff\", said Charli, dryly, on stage after collecting her first award.\n \"I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not sure what.\"\nShe went on to thank Eilish - the first non-Brit to appear on a best song-winner - for her guest vocals on Guess which she delivered at just three days notice. \"Thank you Billie for running and gunning...\"\nShe also picked up the best dance act and songwriter of the year awards.\nIn her speech for best dance act, she spoke of the importance of the night-time genre. \"I feel like dance music, electronic music gets a really bad rep' because everyone is like, 'it's not that deep, is it?'. And I kind of feel it is,\" she said.\n\"This genre of music for me is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nAs she collected her fifth and final award of the night for best album, Charli told the crowd how she had \"always felt like an outsider\" up until this point.\n\"Culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us - I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.\nIt's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.\nFans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule Britannia and a, ahem, close encounter with a beefeater.\nCarpenter also became the first international star to accept the global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of espresso.\"\nWearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.\nBest pop act winner, Jade - of little mix Fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.\nIn it she appeared in a blonde wig and big white fur coat before disappearing briefly somewhere in a crowd of dancers and re-emerging as an angel suspended above the stage. \nSeveral artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.\nJazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".\nChappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".\nRising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\" while urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.\nIt was also a night that marked the return of Sam Fender, with the Geordie singer-songwriter picking up the best alternative/rock act.\nHe thanked his band in his speech, saying he would just be a \"mad man shouting at walls\" without them.\nIt marks the end of a huge week for Fender, who also topped the UK album charts with People Watching - which had the biggest opening week for a British album since Harry Styles' Harry's House in 2022.\nHe topped off the evening with an emphatic performance of its title track.\nBest hip-hop winner Stormzy thanked Jesus and read a verse from the bible before explaining the was wearing shades as he had \"mashed my eye up playing padel\".\nBest R&B act winner Raye said via video that she was \"still recovering\" from last year's event when she won a record-breaking six awards.\nDublin rock band Fontaines D.C said they were \"buzzing\" to win best international group and did so, fittingly, from Down Under.\nAnd Teddy Swims performed his hit Lose Control on a flame-filled stage - a potential fire hazard in his baggy oversized jacket - before Lola Young played her viral hit in a Messy makeshift room.\nIt's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.\nHe poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".\nAnd referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".\nAiming a light dig at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".\nHaving flown over from US filming commitments a few days ago, he showed little signs of jet lag in his bid to \"Make the Brits Great Again\", as he had joked in a pre-show video this week.\n\"If you thought Trump-Zelensky was cringe then wait until you hear me...\" he quipped.\nIt reached peak cringe though when his parents appeared alongside him in one segment, with his dad dressed as Kanye West.\nThe biggest cheer of the night came when actor Danny Dyer told Whitehall that \"the world is being run by cranks\".\nLiam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina last October, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.\nThe ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.\n\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.\nSeven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.\nThere were also snubs for royal royalty The Beatles, Coldplay and The Cure, who like Dua, all lost out to Charli in various catergories.\nLet's hope they're not too Bratty about it.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United and Chelsea will face each other in April\nHaving established a seven-point lead at the top of the Women's Super League with eight games remaining, Chelsea appeared to be cruising towards a sixth consecutive title.\nHowever, Sunday's 2-2 draw with Brighton saw that gap close to five points, after closest challengers Manchester United beat Leicester 2-0 earlier in the day.\nThough this is far from a disaster for Sonia Bompastor's side, is this the start of a dramatic season finale?\nThis video can not be played\nMalard & Galton on target as Man Utd beat Leicester\nIt's fair to say that few expected Manchester United to be involved in a title race this season, having finished fifth last term and with several players then moving on.\nMany expected a drop-off from Chelsea in the wake of manager Emma Hayes' departure, with Manchester City and Arsenal looking best-placed to challenge the Blues' dynasty.\nBut while Bompastor's Chelsea have continued to dominate, dropping points in just two games this season, United have quietly enjoyed a superb campaign.\nThe WSL's form team are currently on a seven-game winning streak, have been beaten once this term and have conceded just six goals in 15 games - fewer than any other side in the division.\nMarc Skinner's side have already beaten last season's points tally of 35 with seven matches still to play.\n\"I'm surprised because of the core group of players they let go,\" former England midfielder Fara Williams told BBC Sport.\n\"I probably didn't give them the chance that maybe I should have. The pressure is back on Chelsea. All Manchester United can do is win the games they have.\"\nGoalkeeper Mary Earps, captain Katie Zelem and top scorer Nikita Parris were among the regular starters to leave the club last summer, yet United look stronger for it.\n\"Having seen how they played this year, the way they have adapted in games and played with different styles is what I am most impressed with,\" Williams said.\n\"We are so used to watching them play out from the back and play through the thirds. At times this season we have seen a different side to them. They haven't been shy of going long and in behind and playing in the opposition half. I have really enjoyed that about Manchester United.\"\nUnited's defensive improvement, inspired by the performances of goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and captain Maya Le Tissier, has returned 10 clean sheets in 15 games and has formed the backbone of their bid to secure a place in next season's Champions League.\n\"They have got back to what they are good at and that's defending,\" Williams said.\n\"They have conceded the least amount of goals in the WSL and that is a baseline for them.

He was told number 10 and you can see the good consequences of it.\"\nAsensio is not the only player who is flourishing since moving to Aston Villa, with Rashford appearing to be putting behind him a difficult season at Manchester United with a strong start to life in the Midlands.\nRashford had been struggling for form at Old Trafford and found himself out of the picture under Ruben Amorim.\nBut the move to Villa and playing alongside Asensio appears to bringing him back to his best.\nSince his debut on 9 February, Rashford has created more chances in all competitions than any other Premier League player (13).\nAgainst Cardiff, Rashford created six chances for Aston Villa, equalling the most he ever created in any of his 426 matches for Manchester United (six vs Wigan in January 2024).\nHe has yet to score, although given his performances so far that will surely come sooner rather than later.\n\"Aston Villa have given him a lifeline,\" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on ITV Sport. \n\"It seems to have come to an end at Manchester United.

Villa have given him a good opportunity.\n\"Things could be very exciting here at Aston Villa with this new exciting Aston Villa forward line.\"\nWith a Champions League last-16 game at Club Brugge up next, Emery believes Asensio and Rashford maintaining their form is key to Villa achieving their ambitions this season.\n\"We need [Asensio] and we need Rashford,\" he said.\n\"We need the players who joined in the last window.

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.\nHis sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.\nA tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. \nIf you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.\nOne of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. \nDuring what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nThe exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nIt escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be \"thankful\" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" \nThe Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.\nIn a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" \n\"He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" Trump said.\nAhead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. \nZelensky had said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. \nNotably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nBut Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.\nTrump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. \nA big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \nOn the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for \"a significant reduction\" in their staff by 13 March.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.\nTrump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter the meeting, Macron said Trump had \"good reason\" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. \nTrump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nPart way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nTrump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.\nThe clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the \"riviera\" of the Middle East.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (\u00a3792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. \nOfficials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.\nTrump unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (\u00a33.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\nThe president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to \"high-level people\".\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. \nIt includes $4.5 trillion (\u00a33.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.\nHowever, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.\nTrump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.\n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

        "article_text": "YouTube started out as an off-beat video sharing site. But at its 20th anniversary, the platform's content has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with each other.\nIn 2006, Time Magazine named its annual Person of the Year: you. \"Yes you,\" the magazine read. \"You control the Information Age. Welcome to your world.\" Its cover featured a mirror to reflect reader's image \u2013 emblazoned on a computer screen tuned to a site modelled after YouTube. It was just a year after YouTube's launch, but already, it had shifted our understanding of the role we would play in the coming era.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. It's gone from a novel tool to an unshakable pillar of technological infrastructure. Some 2.5 billion people log on every month. The company says people who watch YouTube on their TVs consume a billion hours of video a day, to say nothing of time spent on the app and website. But as much as YouTube changed how we use the internet, it's had an equally significant impact on our offline lives.\n\"Not long ago virtually no one took YouTube that seriously,\" journalist Mark Bergen writes in his book Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"But in so many ways, YouTube had set the stage for modern social media, making decisions throughout its history that shaped how attention, money, ideology, and everything else worked online.\"\nYouTube videos have occupied a massive share of our collective consciousness, dictating what brings us together, what drives us apart, what makes us laugh, cry and cringe. \"All the dynamics of social media \u2013 of attention, fame, disrupting old school media \u2013 have mostly grown because of the financial model YouTube built,\" Bergen tells the BBC. Human nature itself has shifted in the last 20 years, and as seen in these five videos, YouTube would become a nexus point for the way we see ourselves and each other.\nLong before the video stitching on TikTok or remixing on Instagram reels, there was Canon Rock, uploaded just 10 months after YouTube's founding. South Korean musician Jeong-Hyun Lim, known online as funtwo, sits in his bedroom with an electric guitar, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap and pixelated footage. A backing track plays the chords to Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D, and Lim joins in, his guitar work subdued in line with the 300-year-old piece. But Lim's playing \u00a0grows more intricate until, about 40 seconds in, he launches into a blazing solo, fingers gliding across the fretboard.\nThe reaction was explosive. As the video racked up hits, around 900 users sent direct video responses to Canon Rock \u2013 big numbers at a time when uploading videos meant plugging in a digital camera \u2013 and thousands more posted their own covers of the song. In 2007, YouTube user Impeto uploaded a compilation of dozens of Canon Rock videos edited into one continuous track, almost as though the whole internet was playing along together. Deft musicianship wasn't new to the web, but the user participation was.\nCanon Rock created a \"reciprocity between artists\" that opened the door for people to see each other as creative partners, says Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University in the US. By democratising the creative process, YouTube created a melting pot for different communities with different interests and skills to make the internet their own.\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our story on the YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know.\nIt helped inspire a new era of online collaboration, according to Jean Burgess, a digital media professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Videos like funtwo's weren't just a performance, Burgess says, they were an invitation, a \"showcasing of skill and the setting of standards for other players in the 'game' to attain or beat\".\nToday's video platforms bombard us with marketing partnerships and endless threads of political discourse. But the musicians behind Canon Rock represented a simpler time, where collaboration was not an economic or ideological proposition, but instead a space where online bedroom dwellers were learning to see each other as members of a global community, a project they were all embarking on together.\nEarly YouTube audiences will probably be familiar with the saga of Bree, better known by the username lonelygirl15. Her story began as a homeschooled girl posting simple videos about her daily life. But things took a bizarre turn when Bree discovered her family was involved with a strange religious cult. Over the weeks and months, the narrative grew more convoluted; Bree ultimately went on the run, investigating secret codes, eluding religious acolytes and fighting a sinister organisation.\nIt was all fiction, of course. But lonelygirl15's start was so mundane that many didn't question the story until the drama was too fantastic to ignore. \"Bree\" had an enigmatic realness \u2013 she was actively connecting with fans on MySpace and corresponding with journalists, and even the New York Times was still asking whether the series was truth or a hoax before the final episode. It sparked ferocious debate in online forums, with viewers picking apart everything from her narrative to the quality of her video production.\n\"[Lonelygirl15] seemed to captivate so many, drawing people who maybe didn\u2019t know what YouTube really was into the fold,\" says Duffy. \"The authenticity, the relatability, the vulnerability, the expressive sharing.\"\nBeyond satire, the series was a pointed effort to use the tropes and norms of social media to misguide the audience. It marked a major development on the internet, where some realised for the first time just how blurry the lines between fact and fiction had become, Duffy says.\nLonelygirl15 was a sea change for many users' relationships to each other, and it forced some people to examine the identities that they themselves were creating online, Bergen says. \"In some ways, the lonelygirl15 series was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"It was a clever commentary about the fact that authenticity doesn't really exist online \u2013 you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one.\"\nIt raised questions about discerning truth on the web, and helped establish a new order where every post, no matter how innocuous, is subject to interrogation and distrust.\nIt's 2011. A young man sits in front of a map of the world. His hands and voice are shaky as he calls his father on the phone. The man is Randy Phillips, an airman in the US Air Force, and he is filming himself telling his dad that he is gay.\nPhillips ran a channel called \"AreYouSurprised\" detailing his life under the US's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy. In his previous videos, Phillips positioned the camera to keep his face just out of view, but hours after the 16-year policy was repealed, he was on full display. Phillips wasn't the only one. His post was an early example of the \"coming out\" video, a YouTube genre that became more and more influential as time went on.\n\"Watching real LGBTQ+ people share their own coming out journeys across platforms like YouTube definitely provided an opportunity for queer and transgender people all over the world to realise they were not alone,\" says Zach Eisenstein, director of communications at The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\u00a0\"When YouTube was just starting up, I was a teenager figuring out my own identity,\" he says. \"It helped me exponentially as I navigated my own coming out journey.\"\nThe offline world was in the throes of change. It would be four years until the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, but following a global economic recession that highlighted growing inequality and shifting political climates, social attitudes were becoming more inclusive.\nTyler Oakley, one of the first major openly gay personalities on the platform, launched the \"Coming Out\" challenge in 2011, encouraging his audience and fellow creators to proudly share their sexual orientations and experiences. YouTubers like Hannah Hart, Ingrid Nilsen and singer Troye Sivan garnered a collective 2.8 million views on their coming out videos. Olympic diver Tom Daley came out in a 2013 video, receiving support from his fans and fellow athletes.\n\"People find creators that speak to them, and very often watch them and get to know them and trust them and are influenced by them in a way that no other platform touches,\" says Ben Relles, former head of comedy at YouTube and cofounder of the YouTube channel Barely Political. The way we present ourselves differs between coworkers, family, friends and strangers, but YouTube circumvented those social links. LGBTQ+ creators leveraged the relationships \u00a0with their audiences to make it plain that people with different sexual identities did not just exist, they were no different than every other person.\n\"Through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the internet, social media has given people a unique ability to find safe and welcoming online communities \u2013 especially when they don\u2019t feel accepted in their in-person ones,\" Eisenstein says.\n\"This is for my 12-year-old self,\" begins Australian YouTuber Essena O'Neill in what she called her last ever YouTube video in 2015. Over the next 17 minutes, O'Neill broke down her decision to quit all social media and made a passionate plea to her followers to do the same. O'Neill's story took aim at the \"contrived\" reality of video and social media production, and its harmful effects on mental health. It was a sign of things to come.\n\"Running a channel is very much like running a treadmill,\" says Matt Koval, a filmmaker and YouTube's former head creator liaison. \"If you stop, if you get off the treadmill for a long period of time, your viewers are going to move on and start watching other people just by nature, and it can be difficult to come back.\" And many creators, even as far back as YouTube's early days, never did.\nQuitting videos have become a social media subgenre unto themselves in the past decade \u2013 people in the public eye realising that they've taken on too much, or that they need a break. But O'Neill's departure helped spark a broader conversation.\n\"People are so dismissive of influencers and creators,\" says Duffy. \"What creative workers experience really presages wider trends in the economy.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\nIt wasn't just creators facing burnout online. In the early days, social media was sold as utopian opportunity, a place where people would come together to share ideas beyond the constraints of traditional gatekeepers. But as time went by, a new discussion emerged about social media's potentially addictive qualities and negative effects on our time, attention and mental health.\nThanks in part to a push from creators like O'Neill, who offered their own experience as a model, conversations about our own relationships to the internet began to shift. Ten years later, we've reached the point the point that officials describe social media as a full on public health crisis \u2013 but that shift in thinking hasn't been enough to keep people off the internet. Social media usage on YouTube and elsewhere is higher than ever, and these days, O'Neill herself is back online.\nA spokesperson for Google, YouTube's parent company, says the platform works hard to ensure it's providing a healthy and fulfilling network, both for creators and users who just come to watch. \"Each YouTube creator has a different definition of success, and we have support mechanisms in place and continue to build a community that allows creators to thrive based on their individual needs and business aspirations,\" the spokesperson says. \"We want creators to make their videos in a healthy, sustainable way, and creating engaging content should always take priority over producing a certain quantity of videos.\" YouTube has invested in a number of efforts to promote mental health among its users and across the globe.\nMore people than ever were watching YouTube videos in the 2010s, with the site averaging one billion users a month by 2013, according to the company. But as YouTubers became more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, some of those feelings turned towards the platform itself.\nFor years, YouTube released an annual recap video looking back at the service's biggest cultural trends. What began as a one-and-a-half-minute round-up turned into big budget productions, bringing together a growing roster of notable creators and celebrities recreating viral moments set to remixed tracks of hit songs. It was a fairly well-received \u2013 until 2018.\nWithin a week, YouTube Rewind 2018 racked up over 10 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube post of all time. Critics panned the video, including the CEO of YouTube's own daughter, arguing the company was promoting a self-serving view of the platform geared towards its own corporate interests, one that glossed how people were actually using and responding to the service. \"The community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\" reporter Julia Alexander wrote at the time. The speed and scope of the reaction was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\"For a long time, YouTube has been pretty tolerant of its creators' and audiences' criticisms. I think that's the sort of atmosphere where it's totally permissible for the audience to get really mad at the company,\" says Bergen. But \"the company has never been great at reading the room\".\nDespite the criticism, YouTube maintains that it's an inclusive space built to allow its community to thrive and feel empowered. \"YouTube has not only democratized content, but democratized opportunity,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"At YouTube, we developed a comprehensive approach aimed to ensure we\u2019re a video streaming platform for high-quality content.\" That includes a set of robust community guidelines, the spokesperson says, one the company works to apply equally to all users in order to combat the spread of harmful content and build a healthy environment that lets users flourish.\nRewind 2018 revealed a festering hostility that grew in the online space. \"There was a marked shift,\" Duffy says. In the earliest days, discussions about YouTube centered around the idea that it promoted a culture of positivity. YouTube's original slogan was \"Broadcast Yourself\" \u2013 creators and users saw the website as a project they were all working on together. But as time wore on, an adversarial tone erupted on the platform, Duffy says, and many started to feel the YouTube they helped build had become too powerful.\nThe biggest change, perhaps, was how people understood the role they played on the platform; once they were creating YouTube, but now, they were just using it.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "\"All the nerves we had that day just melted away because he was such a great person to be with.\"\nTim Baker recalls the moment that he presented the future King with the Royal Shrovetide football that he had painstakingly painted.\nIt was 2003, and King Charles III, who was Prince of Wales at the time, was starting the game or \"turning the ball up\", and like all those who are given this honour, the ball had been carefully painted with images that represented his life.\nMr Baker, 52, had been painting balls for the game since 1991 when he was asked by the game's secretary - who was also his milkman - to paint one for the future King.\nThe Royal Shrovetide Football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, is traditionally played on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday and has been held nearly every year since at least 1667.\nThe game sees thousands of players - in teams called the Up'Ards and Down'Ards - compete to move the ball to opposite ends of the town.\nNormally, Mr Baker said he would meet up for a chat with the person due to \"turn the ball up\" - but this was not possible with a senior member of the Royal Family - so he submitted drawings that were given the go-ahead.\n\"The current King is an accomplished artist, and one thing he asked was how we painted on a sphere,\" Mr Baker explained.\nTo begin with, he starts by measuring the ball, which is bigger than a normal football and heavier because it is filled with cork chippings.\nBuildings are particularly tricky to paint on a round surface, and everything needs to line up because the balls are hung up on display.\nRoyal Shrovetide is played over two days, and Mr Baker always paints the Wednesday ball - and this year it is for the farmer Brian Pegg and features a bull's head and a horse.\nHe said that some of the fine detailing can cause a headache, and each ball involves at least 50 hours of work. Within two hours of play, all this paintwork is gone.\n\"It's awful,\" he added. \"People will grab me by the collar or give me a nudge to say 'your paint has come off quick this year'.\n\"They'll tell you that, but there is nothing you can do.\"\nMr Baker said that he was not \"player material\" and had never played, but he was a fan who loved the history of game.\nHe works at the Historical Centre in Ashbourne, where Royal Shrovetide Football features heavily. \nOne of the repainted balls on display is one that was scored, or \"goaled\", in 1902, the year King Edward VII was crowned.\nIt is particularly special to Mr Baker because it was goaled by Joseph Burton his great-great-great-uncle.\nHe is much more relaxed about it all compared to when he was first asked to take on this role.\n\"I was extremely nervous to start with, because it is such an iconic item in Ashbourne,\" he added.\n\"I was not very old, and I had never done anything like this before. I also knew what I was up against because being a fan of Shrovetide, it was important to get it right.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

        "article_text": "Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.\nFor those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.\n\"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,\" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.\n\"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live.\"\nYulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.\nBefore the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.\nBefore Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.\n\"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,\" says 30-year-old Andriy. \"They don't respect the people of Ukraine.\"\n\"It looks like Washington supports Russia!\" observes Dmytro, 26.\nYou wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.\n\"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,\" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.\nWorld leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.\nHis ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.\nBut Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.\nNot least with his warming to Russia.\nThe initial reaction was that of shock,\" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.\n\"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,\" she adds. \"It's painful.\"\nUkrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.\nPerhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.\n\"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,\" argues Sovsun.\nThere are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.\n\"It's important to find the right mediator,\" she says. \"Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.\n\"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy.\"\nPresident Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.\n\"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,\" she adds. \"Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war.\"\nWhat the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.\n\"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,\" she says.\nWhile there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.\nHer European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.\nHe was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as \"threats to national security\" and \"creating obstacles to economic development\". Mr Poroshenko said it was \"politically motivated\".\nDespite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.\nAs sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.\nRussia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.\n\"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,\" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.\nAfter Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,\" he says.\nAs he ruthlessly pursues his \"America First\" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.\n\"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,\" says Mr Chmut.\n\"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Svitlana Libet.",

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

This is an abhorrent violation of international law and could constitute a war crime. It must stop.\"\nAccording to evidence presented by international human rights groups, victims in the RSF's stronghold of Darfur were often targeted because they were black African rather than Arab, apparently with the aim of driving them out of Sudan.\nThe UN humanitarian response for Sudan is already underfunded. Recent cuts in US aid are expected to reduce programmes to help the victims even further.\nHarrowing details in Unicef's report underscore the dire situation.\n\"After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,\" recalls Omnia (not her real name), an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls.\n\"Every time they raped her, this girl would come back covered in blood. She is still just a young child. They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious. Each of them cries and speaks incoherently. During the 19 days I spent there, I reached a point where I wanted to end my life.\" \nUnicef says the attacks included armed men storming homes and demanding that the girls be surrendered, raping some of them in front of their loved ones.\nVictims were sometimes left with serious injuries and unwanted pregnancies.\nIn addition to the 221 rapes reported by Unicief were an additional 77 cases of sexual assault against children - mostly attempted rape.\nAs a fractured nation at war, Sudan is one of the most challenging places on earth to access services and frontline workers.\n\"The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering,\" said Mohamed Chande Othman, chair of the UN's fact-finding mission when its previous report was published in October.\nThe vast number of people displaced by the war has made women and children more vulnerable to attack \u2013 three out of four school-age girls are out of school, the UN says.\nThe devastating outcome of these crimes is aggravated by the fact that victims have few places to turn to for medical help, because many medical facilities have been destroyed, looted or occupied by the warring parties.\nRecent US aid cuts may be endangering even the limited services available to protect children.\nUnicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities.\nThe activists relied quite heavily on US aid, and most have been forced to shut down, according to a Sudanese coordinating committee that monitors them.\nMore broadly, the UN organization dedicated to protecting women's rights says local organisations led by women are vital in delivering support to survivors of sexual violence. But they receive less than 2% of the total funding of the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Fund.\nThe BBC learned that at least one of these local groups, known as \"She Leads\", was forced to close when US funding was stopped.\nIt was not a big expense, measured in the tens of thousands of dollars, but enabled case workers to reach around 35 survivors a month, said Sulaima Elkhalifa, a Sudanese human rights defender who runs a government unit on combatting violence against woman and helped organize the private initiative.\nThose who have been raped by armed men \"don't have the luxury of being depressed,\" she told the BBC.\nThe demands of war \u2013 finding food, needing to flee \u2013 leave no space to deal with trauma, she added.\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Cinematographer Lol Crawley has had a front row view of the evolution of the entertainment industry over a career spanning more than 25 years.\nFrom listening to Bob Dylan \"on a Welsh hillside\" and studying A-level photography, to shooting some of the most iconic landscapes in modern film.\nHis much-acclaimed latest film, The Brutalist, is about a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the US.\nAnd as he prepares to attend his first Oscars as a nominee, Crawley looks back on his \"formative\" years in Wales with fondness.\nHe was born in Shrewsbury and grew up Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain, Powys, and loved watching films with his father.\n\"I remember insisting he woke me up to watch An American Werewolf in London. I was probably a bit too young for it\u2026 but I really wanted to see a horror movie,\" he recalled.\nThe launch of Channel 4, and in particular, a series called Road Dreams about road trips across America, was also \"really influential\".\nLike many Welsh children, he was exposed to a lot of music and really connected with it.\n\"For me, there's a really big crossover between music and film. When I'm operating a handheld camera, there's a kind of rhythm and a partnership with the performer,\" he said.\nHe continued: \"There's a real beauty and a gentleness to the landscape [in Wales] and I'm drawn to landscapes.\"\nCrawley finished audio visual (AV) studies at college in Wrexham, followed by media production at university, before moving to Los Angeles in 2019. \nHis first film was The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, starring Hugh Grant and shot in Wales, a few miles from where he grew up.\nA cinematographer, also known as the director of photography, is in charge of the look of the film, Crawley explained.\nThey work closely with the director and across the grip department, the lighting department and the camera department.\n\"Each day, we'll have a certain number of scenes that we really have to make,\" he said.\nThe Brutalist - the story of a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the US, directed by Brady Corbet and starring Adrien Brody, Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce - was filmed in Budapest over 33 days on a budget of about $10m.\n\"[It] sounds like a lot, but considering how big the film is in scope, and how long it is, it's a fairly modest schedule and budget,\" he said. \nEach day, the actors would spend time with the director on set as Crawley sat quietly in the corner, working out how best to shoot scenes.\n\"It's about movement of the actors and the camera, what is the focal length, how many shots do we need to tell this part of the story, and how am I going to light it,\" he said. \nHe said the least amount of time he had spent shooting was 21 days on Vox Lux - a film with Natalie Portman set in New York.\n\"The longest was probably 80 days or something, Mandela in South Africa,\" he added.\n\"So it does vary, but 33 days for this movie was very ambitious.\"\nBut, he said, budget did not determine success, as The Brutalist had proven.\nCrawley himself has already been awarded a Silver Frog at Polish cinematography festival Camerimage, won an award at the British Society of Cinematographers, scooped the Robby M\u00fcller Award in Rotterdam, and picked up the BAFTA for best cinematography - not to mention the film's host of other recognitions.\n\"If it's a well-written story, well executed and if the performances are as fine as this, you can make a movie for a million dollars,\" he said.\nHe said audiences \"living in troubling times in America\" connect with the film's themes such as \"abuse of power, art versus commerce, antiquity versus modernity\".\n\"You look at the statue of liberty at the beginning of the movie and it's upended, it's untethered... the statue of liberty is supposed to represent the very best of what America can be in terms of providing a safe haven and a new life for people,\" he said. \n\"We're betraying that at the moment, in my opinion.\"\nHe added it was \"unapologetic event cinema\", at three-and-a-half hours long, and shot on film.\nHe said there was still \"a long way to go\", but he felt there had been big improvements on film sets.\n\"Thankfully there are far more female camera technicians and cinematographers working now than there were and attitudes on set have become a lot better, behaviour on set has become better,\" he said.\nHe said the story and the people were the biggest factors in picking a project, particularly when spending a minimum of three months away from his LA home, where he lives with his wife, film and TV producer Annie Marter.\nThough he regularly rubs shoulders with A-list talent, he is not immune to being star-struck.\n\"I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan and I have been since I was like 10 years old, growing up on this hillside in Wales listening to the albums my dad had. I've worked with him twice now and each time I'm in awe and just find myself staring at him,\" he said.\n\"And I went to the [Oscars] nominees dinner, and it's like 'hello Ralph Fiennes, hello Kate Blanchett' and this is pretty wild.\"\nOn his bucket list is a sci-fi or space film, \"as long as it's an exploration of the human mind at the same time\" and not \"spectacle cinema for the hell of it\".\nAs for returning to Wales, he has ventured over to show his wife where he grew up and reunite with friends, but would \"like to get back more, for sure\".\n\"It would be remarkable to come back and film something in Wales, and there's a thriving film industry as well now.  So who knows?\"\nFor now, he plans to \"embrace\" the \"rollercoaster\" of the Oscars.",

        "article_text": "These were already turbulent times in Romania.\nBut as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.\nA country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.\nWas a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would haven't been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors.

Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

Buttler made 21 in his final outing as skipper.\nThat effectively sealed England's seventh consecutive one-day international defeat by the halfway stage and South Africa took just 29.1 overs to complete their chase.\nJofra Archer took two early wickets but Rassie van der Dussen hit an unbeaten 72 and Heinrich Klaasen 64 from 56 balls as the pursuit became a procession.\nThe Proteas progress as group winners to the semi-finals, where they will play the loser of Sunday's match between India and New Zealand.\nEngland immediately head home after a torrid start to 2025. They have not been on a worse losing run for 24 years and their record in 2025 reads 10 defeats in 11 matches across one-day and T20 matches. \nThis is also the first time they have failed to win a match in the group stage of a global event.\nThere is, at least, a break of almost three months before their next fixture - a Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge which begins on 22 May to mark the start of the men's home international summer.\nMcCullum does not rule out making outsider captain\nEngland hammered & head home winless\nFive issues for England after Buttler resigns\nThis video can not be played\nJansen's three wickets against England\nCoach Brendon McCullum said on Friday night he hoped England's players could \"put on a show\" to send-off Buttler. No such performance was forthcoming.\nIn defeats by Australia and Afghanistan in Lahore, England were competitive and could easily have won both fixtures had they been better in key moments.\nThis defeat, set in motion by weak batting, ranks among their lowest moments at world events with the players seemingly beaten up by their losses across six weeks in India and Pakistan.\nThe exit and Buttler's resignation allows the rebuild to start immediately with McCullum and managing director Rob Key's first task to appoint a new captain.\nButtler's time began with victory in the T20 World Cup in Australia, at which point England were the holders of both white-ball World Cups.\nThey no longer look like contenders, never mind champions. The road to recovery could be long.\nThis video can not be played\nOverton is caught by Ngidi off the bowling of Rabada\nEngland's slide to defeat began in the first over when Phil Salt, having crashed two fours, tamely top-edged a pull to mid-wicket for nine.\nHis tournament tally of 30 runs in three innings is six better than Jamie Smith's, who ended with a three-ball duck as he departed in identical fashion to Salt.\nThere was to be no rebuild from Ben Duckett and Root this time. The former chipped a return catch to Marco Jansen, who dismissed the top three in taking 3-39, via a leading edge, while Root was bowled by seamer Wiaan Mulder.\nIn between, Harry Brook, many people's favourite to take over from Buttler, offered too much air in attempting to clear mid-wicket and was brilliantly caught by the sprawling Jansen on the boundary.\nSouth Africa's fielding was superb \u2013 Lungi Ngidi athletically catching Jamie Overton while running back from mid-on \u2013 but a frazzled England were inept in their decision-making.\nThe worst dismissal was that of Liam Livingstone, who charged spinner Keshav Maharaj, attempted a hack to leg, missed and was stumped for nine.\nButtler's final innings as captain ended in tame fashion as he looped Ngidi to mid-off. When Mulder nicked off Adil Rashid to finish with 3-25, England had been dismissed inside their allotted overs for the eighth time in 11 matches this year.\nThis video can not be played\nArcher bowls Rickelton\nEngland were never going to defend their total on a good pitch but when Archer sent down four wides in a 10-ball opening over it gave the look of a team demoralised.\nArcher bowled both South Africa openers \u2013 Tristan Stubbs with a short ball that deflected down off the glove and Ryan Rickelton by one that kept low \u2013 but conceded a further four wides in a seven-over opening spell.\nBoundaries flowed throughout with any intensity long gone from the game.\nSouth Africa had lost captain Temba Bavuma and opener Tony de Zorzi to illness for this match but still look a fearsome side.\nThat Klassen, whose century in Mumbai at the 2023 World Cup started England's fall from grace, has found form after missing the opening match with an elbow injury is a huge boost.\nHe put on 127 with Van der Dussen and cruised to a half-century, hitting 11 fours, before slicing Rashid to backward point with six runs to get.\nIndia remain tournament favourites but the Proteas, whose victory was sealed by an emphatic David Miller six, have the firepower to go all of the way.\nThis video can not be played\nBest shots from Klaasen's half-century\nEngland captain Jos Buttler: \"That was a really disappointing performance. We were so far short of the mark there.\n\"We're just not going on and making those big telling contributions, which has been the story of this side for a little while now.\n\"I don't know why. As a whole group, not just batters, we're not getting the results and that does take away your confidence.\n\"There is no doubt that the talent is there, there is all the makings of a really good side so I do believe it can be turned around.\"\nSouth Africa captain Aiden Markram: \"The boys were really good. The wicket was quite slow, slower than we expected, and changed our initial plans. The boys adapted to the conditions out there and through that, we were able to take wickets throughout the innings and keep the momentum.\"\nOn potentially playing a semi-final in Dubai: \"We'll have to see when we get there what conditions are going to be like. We've got a great squad with great options and ultimately, we'll pick the squad to get the job done on the day.\"\nChief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special: \"A wretched performance from England and yet not necessarily unexpected. \n\"It was a dispirited team, zero confidence and the 'we can't wait to get home' attitude was evident.\"",

New Zealand are a very good side but we played perfect cricket today.\n\"In such a short tournament you have to try and win every game that's in front of you. Australia have a rich history but it's about us.\"\nNew Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: \"It was a slower wicket than what we have come up against but we knew that coming in.\n\"If you had said we'd have to get 250, we'd have been happy. It spun more than we thought but their four quality spinners makes it pretty tough.\"\nFormer New Zealand wicketkeeper Katey Martin on BBC Test Match Special: \"New Zealand looked clueless against the spin and it was a challenging innings for Kane Williamson.\n\"It felt like they never got out of gear.

        "article_text": "Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.\nFor those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.\n\"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,\" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.\n\"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live.\"\nYulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.\nBefore the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.\nBefore Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.\n\"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,\" says 30-year-old Andriy. \"They don't respect the people of Ukraine.\"\n\"It looks like Washington supports Russia!\" observes Dmytro, 26.\nYou wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.\n\"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,\" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.\nWorld leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.\nHis ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.\nBut Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.\nNot least with his warming to Russia.\nThe initial reaction was that of shock,\" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.\n\"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,\" she adds. \"It's painful.\"\nUkrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.\nPerhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.\n\"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,\" argues Sovsun.\nThere are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.\n\"It's important to find the right mediator,\" she says. \"Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.\n\"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy.\"\nPresident Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.\n\"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,\" she adds. \"Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war.\"\nWhat the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.\n\"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,\" she says.\nWhile there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.\nHer European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.\nHe was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as \"threats to national security\" and \"creating obstacles to economic development\". Mr Poroshenko said it was \"politically motivated\".\nDespite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.\nAs sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.\nRussia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.\n\"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,\" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.\nAfter Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,\" he says.\nAs he ruthlessly pursues his \"America First\" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.\n\"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,\" says Mr Chmut.\n\"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Svitlana Libet.",

        "article_text": "TikTok is profiting from sexual livestreams performed by teens as young as 15,  the BBC has been told.\nWe spoke to three women in Kenya who said they began this activity as teenagers. They told us they used TikTok to openly advertise and negotiate payment for more explicit content that would be sent via other messaging platforms.\nTikTok bans solicitation but the company knows it takes place, moderators have told the BBC. TikTok takes a cut of about 70% from all livestream transactions, we have previously found.\nTikTok told the BBC it has \"zero tolerance for exploitation\".\nLivestreams from Kenya are popular on TikTok - each night over the course of a week, we found up to a dozen in which women performers danced suggestively, watched by hundreds of people around the world.\nWarning: Contains details of a sexual nature\nIt's two o'clock in the morning in Nairobi, and the TikTok Lives are in full flow.\nMusic blasts, and\u202fusers chat over each other, as a woman turns her camera on to twerk or pose provocatively. Emoji \"gifts\" then fill the screen.\n\"Inbox me for kinembe guys. Tap, tap,\" the performers say on repeat. \"Tap, tap,\" is a phrase commonly used on TikTok, calling for viewers to \"like\" a  livestream.\n\"Kinembe\" is Swahili for \"clitoris\". \"Inbox me\" instructs the viewer to send a private message over TikTok with a more explicit bespoke request - such as to watch the performer masturbating, stripping or performing sexual activities with other women.\nIn some of the livestreams we watched, coded sexual slang was used to advertise sexual services.\nThe emoji gifts act as payment for the TikTok livestreams and - because TikTok removes any obvious sexual acts and nudity - also the more explicit content sent later on other platforms. The gifts can be converted into cash.\n\"It's not in TikTok's interest to clamp down on soliciting of sex - the more people give gifts on a livestream\u2026 [the] more revenue for TikTok,\" says a Kenyan former moderator we are calling Jo - one of more than 40,000 moderators TikTok says it employs globally.\nWe discovered that TikTok is still taking about a 70% cut from livestream gifts. The company denied it took such a large commission after we established the same cut in a 2022 investigation.\nTikTok has long been aware of child exploitation in its livestreams - having run its own internal investigation in 2022 - but ignored the issue because it \"profited significantly\" from them, according to the claims of a lawsuit brought by the US state of Utah last year.\nTikTok responded that the lawsuit - which is ongoing - ignored the \"proactive measures\" it had made to improve safety.\nKenya is a hotspot for this abuse, says the charity ChildFund Kenya, compounded by a young demographic and widespread internet usage. The African continent as a whole also has poor online moderation compared to Western countries, the charity added.\nJo, who worked for Teleperformance - contracted by TikTok to provide content moderation - says moderators are given a reference guide of banned sexual words or actions. But this guide is restrictive, says Jo, and does not take into account slang or other provocative gestures.\n\"You can see by the way they are posing, with the camera on their cleavage and thighs [for example], that they are soliciting sex. They may not say anything, but you can see they are signposting to their [other platform] account, but there's nothing I can do.\"\nAnother content moderator for Teleperformance, who we are calling Kelvin, says moderation is also limited by TikTok's increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), which he says is not sensitive enough to pick up on local sexual slang.\nJo and Kelvin are among seven current and former content moderators working on TikTok content who told us their concerns. Jo says about 80% of livestreams flagged in content moderators' feeds were sexual, or advertising sexual services, and TikTok is aware of the scale of the issue.\nChildFund Kenya and other charities have told the BBC that children as young as nine are taking part in these activities.\nWe have spoken to teenage girls and young women who say they are spending up to six or seven hours a night on the activity and making on average \u00a330 a day - enough to pay for a week's food and transport.\n\"I sell myself on TikTok. I dance naked. I do that because that's where I can earn money to support myself,\" says a 17-year-old we are calling Esther. She lives in a poor Nairobi neighbourhood, where 3,000 residents share toilet facilities. She says the money helps her buy food for her child, and support her mother who has been struggling to pay the rent since Esther's father died.\nShe says she was 15 years old when she was introduced to TikTok Lives by a friend, who helped her bypass the age restrictions - only over-18s can use a Live. Users also need at least 1,000 followers to go live. \nSo TikTok users with a big following can act as digital pimps - hosting the livestreams selling sexual content. Some of them have back-up accounts, indicating they have been banned or suspended by TikTok in the past.\nThey appear to know how to evade detection by TikTok's content moderators, while generating the right amount of sexual teasing to pique customers' interest.\n\"When you're dancing, move away from the camera, otherwise you'll get blocked,\" shouts a pimp to a woman twerking on screen.\nIn return for being hosted, the women give pimps a cut of their earnings.\nThe relationship can quickly turn exploitative, says Esther. She says her digital pimp knew she was under 18, and \"he likes using young girls\".\nHe put pressure on her to earn more - meaning she needed to livestream more frequently - and took a larger cut of her earnings than she expected, she says.\n\"So if an emoji is sent which is 35,000ksh (\u00a3213), he takes 20,000ksh (\u00a3121) and you only get 15,000ksh (\u00a391).\"\nWorking for him was like being in \"handcuffs\" she says.\u202f\"You are the one hurting because he gets the biggest share and yet it is you who has been used.\"\n\"Sophie\", not her real name, who says she was also 15 when she started livestreaming on TikTok, says she got requests from men in Europe for services on third-party platforms, including from one a German user who would demand that she caress her breasts and genitals for money.\nNow 18, she regrets her online sex work. Some of the videos she sent to users via other platforms were then uploaded to social media without her consent, she says.\nHer neighbours found out, and warned other young people not to associate with her, she told the BBC.\n\"They brand me as a lost sheep, and young people are told that I'll mislead them. I am lonely most of the time.\"\nSome of the girls and women we spoke to said they had also been paid to meet TikTok users for sex in person, or had been pressured into having sex with their pimps.\nTikTok is keen to establish itself in African markets, but is not employing enough staff to effectively monitor content, the content moderators in Kenya told us.\nKenya's government has shown signs of acknowledging the issue - in 2023, President William Ruto held a meeting with TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew to call for better content moderation on the platform. The government said the company had agreed to tighter regulation, with a TikTok office in Kenya to help co-ordinate operations.\nBut the moderators we spoke to said, more than 18 months later, neither had happened.\nTeleperformance replied that its moderators  \"work diligently to tag and flag user-generated content based on community standards and client guidelines\" and that its clients' systems are not set up to allow Teleperformance to remove offending material or report it to law enforcement authorities.\nA spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC:\n\"TikTok has zero tolerance for exploitation. We enforce strict safety policies, including robust Live content rules, moderation in 70 languages, including Swahili, and we partner with local experts and creators, including our Sub-Saharan Africa Safety Advisory Council to continually strengthen our approach.\"",

Jo says about 80% of livestreams flagged in content moderators' feeds were sexual, or advertising sexual services, and TikTok is aware of the scale of the issue.Anonymous whistleblowers from a company providing TikTok with content moderation spoke to the BBCChildFund Kenya and other charities have told the BBC that children as young as nine are taking part in these activities.We have spoken to teenage girls and young women who say they are spending up to six or seven hours a night on the activity and making on average \u00a330 a day - enough to pay for a week's food and transport. \"Inbox me\" instructs the viewer to send a private message over TikTok with a more explicit bespoke request - such as to watch the performer masturbating, stripping or performing sexual activities with other women.In some of the livestreams we watched, coded sexual slang was used to advertise sexual services.The emoji gifts act as payment for the TikTok livestreams and - because TikTok removes any obvious sexual acts and nudity - also the more explicit content sent later on other platforms. \"Another content moderator for Teleperformance, who we are calling Kelvin, says moderation is also limited by TikTok's increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), which he says is not sensitive enough to pick up on local sexual slang.Jo and Kelvin are among seven current and former content moderators working on TikTok content who told us their concerns. The African continent as a whole also has poor online moderation compared to Western countries, the charity added.Payment on TikTok, usually for activities such as make-up tutorials, is made via emoji \"gifts\" which can be exchanged for money Jo, who worked for Teleperformance - contracted by TikTok to provide content moderation - says moderators are given a reference guide of banned sexual words or actions.",

        "article_text": "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.\nMortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.\nHowever, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.\nThe research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.\n\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.\nThere was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".\nThe registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.\nFrom 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.\nTo calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.\n\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"\nAlthough similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.\nResearchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.\nAt the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.\nSome academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.\nDementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.\n\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.\n\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"\nHe added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.\nOverall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.\nSo the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.\nBut the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.\n\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"\nDeath numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.\n\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.\n\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"\nThe UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.\n\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"\nCommenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.\n\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.\n\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"\nThe CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.\nThe rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.\nChanges to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.\nTo fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".\n\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"\nTwo years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.\nBut now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.\nCorporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.\nThe moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.\nSince assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\nIn the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.\nAt first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".\nProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.\nUnder names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.\nAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.\nDEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.\nThe programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.\nBut almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".\nMore recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.\nThe roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".\nSocial media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.\nOne of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.\nAnother major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.\nThe ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.\nThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.\nMartin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.\nSurveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".\nMuch rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.\nSome research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.\nThis research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.\nThe problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.\nShe cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.\nBut Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.\nAnd when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.\nWhere studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.\nSupporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.\nLast autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year \u2013 43 \u2013 and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.\nColleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.\nBut the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.\nFor the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.\nBecause of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.\nBut another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.\nDartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.\nIt's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.\nMichelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"\nBut as to the question at the centre of her book \u2013 is DEI dead? \u2013 Jolivet says the answer is no.\nThe companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.\nShe gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"\nBut not everyone is reassured.\nBack in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.\nShe fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".\nShe says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\"\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says the writer's block she experienced after becoming pregnant with her first child was \"terrifying\".\n\"It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning,\" the acclaimed Nigerian author, 47, tells the BBC's Emma Barnett.\n\"I'm not sure that it was just entirely physiological but something changed, and I just could not get back into that magical place where I can write fiction.\"\nAdichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Last year, she had twin boys, now 11 months old.\nWhile she was pregnant, she had a \"very foggy feeling\" and \"couldn't think as clearly,\" she says.\n\"I'm a person for whom thinking clearly is so important, and so to be in that kind of place emotionally is very frightening,\" she says.\nAdichie is now releasing her first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count.\nThe book tells the story of four women navigating lives that aren't going to plan.\n\"I couldn't write for a while, and then I started writing again,\" she says.\nAdichie is known for work that explores themes including feminism, gender and immigration. The novelist's 2012 Ted Talk We Should All Be Feminists helped push her to greater prominence, and was even sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 on her 2013 song Flawless.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, she speaks about topics including parenthood, grief and artificial intelligence (AI).\nAdichie's beliefs about gender have led her to reflect on how she'd like to bring up her sons. \"I'm determined to raise good men,\" she says.\n\"I want to raise my boys to be emotionally comfortable, to be in touch with emotion, to not be afraid of emotion, and also to not be afraid of fear,\" she continues.\nCompared to girls, Adichie believes boys don't have many \"wholesome\" role models. \"This space is just occupied by noxious characters and ideas,\" she says.\nThe writer adds that she wants her sons to be \"the kind of boys that never start a fight but if you bring a fight to them, they will beat you up\".\nAs well as having her three children, since writing her last novel, Adichie has also lost both of her parents.\n\"Grief recedes but only in waves and then, at some point, it comes back,\" she says.\nAdichie was surprised by how physical grief felt. \"Your heart really is very heavy, you feel as though your body is somehow no longer able to carry the weight of your heart,\" she says.\nThe novelist says that grieving for her mother, who died suddenly on her father's birthday in 2021, had a role in shaping her new novel.\nWhen she started writing the book - after her mother died - \"I did not think I was writing about my mother,\" she says. But when she had nearly finished, she reread the manuscript and realised there was \"so much about mothers and daughters\" in it, even though she hadn't been conscious of this while writing.\n\"I felt very strongly that, in some ways, my mother had opened the door for me to get back into this magical place that means that I can write fiction,\" Adichie says. \"I kind of thought that she's comforting me, and it was actually deeply emotional for me to make that realisation.\"\nAs someone with a deep emotional connection to the creative process, it is perhaps unsurprising that when the conversation turns to AI, Adichie has a strong stance.\nThe author says that we should not refer to any written content produced by generative AI produces as stories and that the technology is going to make all of us, if we embrace it widely, \"increasingly stupid\".\nShe argues that AI could limit human creativity, something she says \"we should never think that we can somehow replace\".\nEven using AI for tasks like summarising work emails can be damaging, she says. \n\"The ability to summarise is something that requires a certain level of creativity and imagination and intelligence, and it just seems to me that if you're ceding that to something else, what are we going to let our brains do for us?\"\nWatch the full interview on BBC iPlayer - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: The Interview with Emma Barnett",

        "article_text": "\"I grew up round here thinking I could not wait to get out,\" says 51-year-old Dan Davies.\n\"And then I used to come back up from London on a weekly basis and would see half the place boarded up and going downhill fast.\"\nNew Brighton, on the northern tip of the Wirral peninsula in Merseyside, was once a booming holiday destination boasting the longest promenade in the country, a pier and a tower bigger than Blackpool's.\nBut in the mid-1980s, after cheap package deals to Spain had become the first choice for many holidaymakers, New Brighton found itself struggling to keep up, and photographer Martin Parr's famous 1986 collection The Last Resort depicted it as a scruffy, litter-strewn town whose glory days were behind it.\nNow, though, it is undergoing a huge renaissance: in 2020 house prices rose faster in New Brighton than anywhere else in the country, investment is returning and businesses are thriving.\nSo how does a place go from being somewhere people cannot wait to leave to somewhere people cannot move to fast enough?\nFran Barrett, 35, returned to New Brighton after going away to London to study and work as a journalist.\n\"When you're a kid you never want to live where you're growing up,\" she said. \n\"But I realised as I got older why it was such a great place to live.\"\nWhile many of Fran's friends who stayed in London were still trying to get on the property ladder, she and her husband and toddler son were able to move up a rung in 2021 because of the \u00a330,000 they made in profit on their terraced home.\n\"It just has a real community feel to it,\" said Fran. \n\"There are so many new businesses springing up, and if you've got kids there are so many great little parks. \n\"A lot of my friends from other parts of the Wirral are moving here, too.\"\nAnd they all need places to eat, drink and shop. \nFran's sister Lou runs the caf\u00e9 bar and gift shop SUP, just one of many independent businesses that have sprung up in the town in recent years.\nA few hundred yards away from SUP is the James Atherton pub, which takes its name from the resort's founder who, in the 1830s, set about creating a northern version of Sussex seaside town Brighton.\nThe pub made national headlines in 2020 when it was renamed in a disparaging tribute to Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings and their three-tier coronavirus lockdown restrictions.\nIt is one of a number of buildings in Victoria Road that Dan's company Rockpoint Leisure revived.\nTo \"keep out the big boys\", as he puts it, the company bought up parcels of land and buildings and made sure independent shops, cafes and art spaces were able to move in. \nThe walls of many of them are now festooned with large murals by artists both local and global.\n\"We wanted to demonstrate that you don't need big outside consultants to come in and tell you what you need, you need a sustainable plan that can protect a place like New Brighton.\n\"We did that, and we have become the number one model for seaside town regeneration,\" he says.\nVictoria Road is a haven of independent businesses. \nThe Hatch art gallery opened in an old greengrocer's shop and took its name from the hatch through which people were served during the pandemic.\n\"Seaside towns are absolutely having a renaissance,\" says owner Anneley Pickles, 51. \n\"They just need things that will bring people here, whether that's food or entertainment, or workshops or arts spaces.\"\nJust up the road is Tallulah's Emporium, which owner Wayne Saunders describes as a \"listening space\" after the model of the Japanese kissa bars that specialise in playing jazz records.\nWayne, 51, left New Brighton in 1989, at a time when \"numerous friends from primary school had ended up dead or in prison\".\nHe moved to London, where he opened the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Shoreditch, before returning to New Brighton to open up Tallulah's in 2022.\nHe agrees with Dan's assessment that New Brighton is, with its thriving independent scene, \"Wirral's Brooklyn to Liverpool's Manhattan\".\nThere are not many remnants of New Brighton's past as a Victorian and Edwardian seaside town still visible today. \nThe tower was pulled down and sold for scrap in the 1920s, while the ballroom was gutted by fire in 1969 and then demolished.\nBut the town has always remained a seaside resort. \nIn 2011, the Marine Point development opened at an estimated cost of about \u00a365m, bringing a cinema, hotel, bars and restaurants to the seafront. \nIt stands a short distance from the Fort Perch Rock coastal defence battery \u2013 now a museum \u2013 which was built in the 1820s to protect Liverpool from foreign naval attack, and the Adventureland amusement complex which was built about 100 years later and which has been mooted for redevelopment as apartments in recent years.\nJayne Casey, a former member of punk band Big In Japan, now runs a small deli and arts bar District House just around the corner in Victoria Road.\nNow 68, she remembers the New Brighton of the 1980s that was encapsulated in Parr's Last Resort collection, and believes that, generally, the photos captured the area quite well.\n\"It was where people from Liverpool and the Wirral came for a cheap day out,\" she says.\n\"It had a beautiful 1930s outdoor swimming pool, and had that classic seaside town look to it.\n\"It was a place that working-class people came en-masse in the time when the factories closed down for a week and everyone had a week at the seaside.\"\nToday the resort is still popular with day trippers and families. \nAnd according to one person who was involved in its regeneration over the last decade, attempts to broaden what the town had to offer were not always met with open arms.\n\"There was a feeling from some that New Brighton is just about grandparents bringing their grandkids for day out,\" they said. \n\"But there were those who felt it was about more than just Fort Perch Rock and the promenade.\"\nJane, who helped transform a wilderness of empty warehouses near the Liverpool waterfront into the arts and tech enclave now known as the Baltic Triangle, says that while art and culture are playing a big part in New Brighton's renaissance and transformation, the town is not being \"gentrified\".\nGentrification is the process through which working-class urban populations find themselves displaced and priced out of their own communities.\n\"Yes, house prices have gone up and new people have come in but I don't think any kind of mass gentrification has happened,\" she says. \n\"But,\" she warns, \"there are some big sites that could come up and then could become apartment blocks and flats.\"\nNew Brighton's promenade \u2013 the longest in Britain \u2013 will be most familiar to those outside the north-west of England as the location of a Channel 4 ident that includes the TV network's logo running to keep pace with a group of wheelchair racers.\nNext month, the documentary I Am Martin Parr will be screened at The Light cinema, part of the Marine Point complex which looms over the promenade where that clip was filmed and where one of Parr's most infamous shots was taken.\nJose Wilmin, who has been coming to New Brighton for more than 60 years from her home in Ellesmere Port, has witnessed the resort going through its ups and downs in that time.\n\"It used to be a proper holiday place, there was a massive outdoor pool, a big funfair and the main street was just packed with bucket-and-spade shops,\" the 68-year-old says.\nWhile she says it is great to see New Brighton \"on the up again\", she has been a regular through good times and bad.\n\"I've always come here, to have fish and chips and watch the world go by.\n\"It's where I used to come with my mum. It's where all my memories were made.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

He later moved into personnel management.\nFor his 21st birthday, he was given a set of watercolour paints and then spent much of his spare time teaching himself to paint.\nHe drew inspiration from works at Kirkcaldy Galleries, studying paintings from artists such as Samuel Peploe and William McTaggart so intently that he feared arousing the suspicions of gallery staff.\nHis breakthrough came in 1989 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy's annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist.\nHis works garnered international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities including London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York.\nVettriano was often dismissed by critics, who variously described his work as \"brainless erotica\", \"mere wallpaper\" and \"crass male fantasy\".\nBut in an interview with the Radio Times, he responded: \"They don't like an artist who is as popular as me because it takes away part of their authority.

She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California.\n\"It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren't even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,\" she says.\n\"If I'm honest, I didn't think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn't even anything major.\n\"So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family.\n\"I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn't have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family.\"\nThe day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself.\nIt was a period she describes as \"one of the hardest times in my life\".\nShe says: \"It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game.\n\"I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out.\n\"My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego.\"\nCasey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018\nIt took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney's consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and \"our lives\". They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim.\n\"[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time.\"\nShe also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities.\n\"It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn't have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds.\"\nThe ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women's Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time.\nBut then along came the Canada job.\nAt first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she \"loves\", which is working with players day to day.\nYet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months.\n\"I really liked that it was extensive,\" she says. \"It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me.\"\nThat included speaking to the manager of the men's team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game.\nAnd she was impressed \u2013 by the organisation's leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role.\n\"When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn't have to move,\" she said.\n\"That's been really, really beneficial for us as a family. I don't think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you're in a privileged position, but it's the impact on your family it has.\n\"I had young children that just didn't understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I'd contributed to that, which was difficult.\n\"There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn't have a job. There were some I would have been interested in, some I wouldn't have been interested in, but as soon as I got involved in this process it became clear I was really interested in this [and] I was only committed to one thing.\"\nCasey Stoney took charge of Canada for the first time in February, overseeing two wins and one draw in the Pinatar Cup in Spain\nShe is taking over a country who are ranked sixth in the world but have experienced their own turmoil.\nDuring last summer's Paris Olympics, in which Canada reached the quarter-finals, two members of the team's coaching staff were sent home for flying a drone over a training session held by New Zealand, their opponents in a group game.\nTheir head coach Bev Priestman, another Englishwoman, was given a year-long ban by world governing body Fifa and Canada - who had won Olympic gold at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games - were docked six points.\nPriestman \"did reach out and wish me luck\" says Stoney, but they have had no other communication and the new Canada coach is keen to focus on the future, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon.\nShe met the majority of her players for the first time over the last two weeks as Canada competed in a four-team tournament, the Pinatar Cup, in Spain, which they won following a 7-0 thrashing of Chinese Taipei, a 2-0 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with China.\n\"This team excites me,\" she says. \"I do think they've got so much potential.\n\"What they were able to achieve last year in difficult circumstances shows what they're capable of, but there's so much more to come.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.\nDespite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.\nSo what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.\nIn Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.\nToday, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.\nKey markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.\nMeanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.\nBut the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.\nStays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"\nWhat's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.\n\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"\nInstead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.\nBut it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.\nA common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.\nThey sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.\nMonika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.\nMore tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.\nAnd, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".\nQuestions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.\nAnd also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.\nBy calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.\nThe Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"\nThe required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.\nSome Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".\nWengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.\nWengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".\nThe resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"\nAmong them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".\nBut most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".\nIn more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.\nAnd, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"\nAnd while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

Without this flow of capital, Canada \"ceases to exist as a viable country\", he wrote.\nTrump has previously spoken of using \"economic force\" to make Canada the 51st state of America. But he said he was not considering using military force - an assurance he has not given while stating his ambitions of taking the Panama Canal and Greenland.\nThe question of how to respond to Trump's tariff threats and other statements about Canadian sovereignty has dominated the debate in Trudeau's Liberal Party, with candidates vying to replace the PM after he announced his resignation in January. \nOn the other side of the Canadian political divide, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has also attacked Trump's statements.\nThe King has found himself at the centre of a recent whirlwind of diplomatic meetings following Trump's return to the presidency - some of which relate to the war in Ukraine.\nOn Sunday, he also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who ended up in a row of his own with Trump at the White House on Friday. \nZelensky was in the UK to meet European leaders, who reiterated their support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia - with American support apparently on the wane under Trump.",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "The world's largest iceberg has run aground in shallow waters off the remote British island of South Georgia, home to millions of penguins and seals.\nThe iceberg, which is about twice the size of Greater London, appears to be stuck and should start breaking up on the island's south-west shores.\nFisherman fear they will be forced to battle with vast chunks of ice, and it could affect some macaroni penguins feeding in the area.\nBut scientists in Antarctica say that huge amounts of nutrients are locked inside the ice, and that as it melts, it could create an explosion of life in the ocean.\n\"It's like dropping a nutrient bomb into the middle of an empty desert,\" says Prof Nadine Johnston from British Antarctic Survey.\nEcologist Mark Belchier who advises the South Georgia government said: \"If it breaks up, the resulting icebergs are likely to present a hazard to vessels as they move in the local currents and could restrict vessels' access to local fishing grounds.\"\nThe stranding is the latest twist in an almost 40-year story that began when the mega chunk of ice broke off the Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986.\nWe have tracked its route on satellite pictures since December when it finally broke free after being trapped in an ocean vortex.\nAs it moved north through warmer waters nicknamed iceberg alley, it remained remarkably intact. For a few days, it even appeared to spin on the spot, before speeding up in mid-February travelling at about 20 miles (30km) a day.\n\"The future of all icebergs is that they will die. It's very surprising to see that A23a has lasted this long and only lost about a quarter of its area,\" said Prof Huw Griffiths, speaking to BBC News from the Sir David Attenborough polar research ship currently in Antarctica.\nOn Saturday the 300m tall ice colossus struck the shallow continental shelf about 50 miles (80km) from land and now appears to be firmly lodged.\n\"It's probably going to stay more or less where it is, until chunks break off,\" says Prof Andrew Meijers from British Antarctic Survey.\nIt is showing advancing signs of decay. Once 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in size, it has been steadily shrinking, shedding huge amounts of water as it moves into warmer seas. It is now an estimated 3,234 sq km.\n\"Instead of a big, sheer pristine box of ice, you can see caverns under the edges,\" Prof Meijers says.\nTides will now be lifting it up and down, and where it is touching the continental shelf, it will grind backwards and forwards, eroding the rock and ice.\n\"If the ice underneath is rotten - eroded by salt - it'll crumble away under stress and maybe drift somewhere more shallow,\" says Prof Meijers.\nBut where the ice is touching the shelf, there are thousands of tiny creatures like coral, sea slugs and sponge.\n\"Their entire universe is being bulldozed by a massive slab of ice scraping along the sea floor,\" says Prof Griffiths.\nThat is catastrophic in the short-term for these species, but he says that it is a natural part of the life cycle in the region.\n\"Where it is destroying something in one place, it's providing nutrients and food in other places,\" he adds.\nThere had been fears for the islands' larger creatures. In 2004 an iceberg in a different area called the Ross Sea affected the breeding success of penguins, leading to a spike in deaths.\nBut experts now think that most of South Georgia's birds and animals will escape that fate.\nSome Macaroni penguins that forage on the shelf where the iceberg is stuck could be affected, says Peter Fretwell at the British Antarctic Survey.\nThe iceberg melts freshwater into salt water, reducing the amount of food including krill (a small crustacean) that penguins eat.\nThe birds could move to other feeding grounds, he explains, but that would put them in competition with other creatures.\nThe ice could block harbours or disrupt sailing when the fishing season starts in April.\n\"We will have to do battle with A23a for sure,\" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes.\nBut scientists working in Antarctica currently are also discovering the incredible contributions that icebergs make to ocean life.\nProf Griffiths and Prof Johnston are working on the Sir David Attenborough ship collecting evidence of what their team believe is a huge flow of nutrients from ice in Antarctica across Earth.\nParticles and nutrients from around the world get trapped into the ice, which is then slowly released into the ocean, the scientists explain.\n\"Without ice, we wouldn't have these ecosystems. They are some of the most productive in the world, and support huge numbers of species and individual animals, and feed the biggest animals in the world like the blue whale,\" says Prof Griffiths.\nA sign that this nutrient release has started around A23a will be when vast phytoplankton blooms blossom around the iceberg. It would look like a vast green halo around the ice, visible from satellite pictures over the next weeks and months.\nThe life cycle of icebergs is a natural process, but climate change is expected to create more icebergs as Antarctica warms and becomes more unstable.\nMore could break away from the continent's vast ice sheets and melt at quicker rates, disrupting patterns of wildlife and fishing in the region.",

The pressure is back on Chelsea. All Manchester United can do is win the games they have.\"\nGoalkeeper Mary Earps, captain Katie Zelem and top scorer Nikita Parris were among the regular starters to leave the club last summer, yet United look stronger for it.\n\"Having seen how they played this year, the way they have adapted in games and played with different styles is what I am most impressed with,\" Williams said.\n\"We are so used to watching them play out from the back and play through the thirds. At times this season we have seen a different side to them. They haven't been shy of going long and in behind and playing in the opposition half. I have really enjoyed that about Manchester United.\"\nUnited's defensive improvement, inspired by the performances of goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and captain Maya Le Tissier, has returned 10 clean sheets in 15 games and has formed the backbone of their bid to secure a place in next season's Champions League.\n\"They have got back to what they are good at and that's defending,\" Williams said.\n\"They have conceded the least amount of goals in the WSL and that is a baseline for them.
