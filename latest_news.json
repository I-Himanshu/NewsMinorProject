        "article_text": "Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass. \nWhen asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.\" \nHowever, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.\nIn public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops. \n\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.\nAccording to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.\nPresident Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests. \nHe suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?\nThe short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.\nBritain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending. \nBut Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.\nInstead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.  \nThat force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.\n\nBut these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".\nOfficials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nIt could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.\nWhile Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.\nEuropean nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics. \nNato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough. \nBut the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.\nEurope's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.\nFrance is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.\nSir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.  But as for Donald Trump's question - would  Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no. \n",

It's absolutely amazing,\" Hannah said. \nBass player Emer McLaughlin was equally thrilled at the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\"I'm so incredibly excited and honoured to be supporting giants Snow Patrol in the SSE Arena.\n\"This has been a literal dream come true for us as an upcoming band in so many ways.\n\"It's such a landmark venue - it's our first ever arena show - and to be supporting a fellow Irish band like Snow Patrol just makes it such an unbelievable experience.\"\nThe members of CHERYM say that when it comes to the music industry they, like many other young bands, need as much exposure as possible in order to progress in a very competitive industry. \n\"This is probably the biggest level of exposure we've ever had,\" says Alannagh.\nAlthough CHERYM are signed to a small independent record label called Alcopop Records, who they say are so artist-friendly, Alannagh says it is \"extremely difficult\" to make a name for yourself.\n\"I saw an article by Sam Fender where he was speaking about the music industry very recently and how ninety per cent of it are people who come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds.\n\"Whereas for a working-class band it is very, very difficult to do that.\"\nAlannagh explained that CHERYM's members rely on funding and other support \"to actually be able to pay our petrol money on the way home and to be able to make a living out of this\".\n\"Some of us have full time jobs in order to make this work,\" she said.\n\"So we have to have a second job in order to pursue our actual passion.\"\nThe band are delighted that Lightbody likes their music and described the support from Snow Patrol's members as \"very reassuring\".\nCHERYM have also toured with The Undertones and say it was an experience they will never forget as the popular Derry band took them under their wing.\nThey even got to perform the famous anthem Teenage Kicks live on stage with them.\n\"It was so fun. They were like Derry das on tour,\" says Alannagh.\n\"Everybody was sitting together to have dinner before the show and they invited us up on stage to play Teenage Kicks with them which was extremely exciting.\"\nSpeaking before the Belfast show, Hannah said she was extremely nervous about playing support to Snow Patrol but would \"love every minute\".\nDuring the gig, Lightbody dedicated Snow Patrol's performance of Chasing Cars to the band's support acts CHERYM and Nina Nesbitt.",

I was probably a bit too young for it\u2026 but I really wanted to see a horror movie,\" he recalled.\nThe launch of Channel 4, and in particular, a series called Road Dreams about road trips across America, was also \"really influential\".\nLike many Welsh children, he was exposed to a lot of music and really connected with it.\n\"For me, there's a really big crossover between music and film. When I'm operating a handheld camera, there's a kind of rhythm and a partnership with the performer,\" he said.\nHe continued: \"There's a real beauty and a gentleness to the landscape [in Wales] and I'm drawn to landscapes.\"\nCrawley finished audio visual (AV) studies at college in Wrexham, followed by media production at university, before moving to Los Angeles in 2019. \nHis first film was The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, starring Hugh Grant and shot in Wales, a few miles from where he grew up.\nA cinematographer, also known as the director of photography, is in charge of the look of the film, Crawley explained.\nThey work closely with the director and across the grip department, the lighting department and the camera department.\n\"Each day, we'll have a certain number of scenes that we really have to make,\" he said.\nThe Brutalist - the story of a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the US, directed by Brady Corbet and starring Adrien Brody, Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce - was filmed in Budapest over 33 days on a budget of about $10m.\n\"[It] sounds like a lot, but considering how big the film is in scope, and how long it is, it's a fairly modest schedule and budget,\" he said. \nEach day, the actors would spend time with the director on set as Crawley sat quietly in the corner, working out how best to shoot scenes.\n\"It's about movement of the actors and the camera, what is the focal length, how many shots do we need to tell this part of the story, and how am I going to light it,\" he said. \nHe said the least amount of time he had spent shooting was 21 days on Vox Lux - a film with Natalie Portman set in New York.\n\"The longest was probably 80 days or something, Mandela in South Africa,\" he added.\n\"So it does vary, but 33 days for this movie was very ambitious.\"\nBut, he said, budget did not determine success, as The Brutalist had proven.\nCrawley himself has already been awarded a Silver Frog at Polish cinematography festival Camerimage, won an award at the British Society of Cinematographers, scooped the Robby M\u00fcller Award in Rotterdam, and picked up the BAFTA for best cinematography - not to mention the film's host of other recognitions.\n\"If it's a well-written story, well executed and if the performances are as fine as this, you can make a movie for a million dollars,\" he said.\nHe said audiences \"living in troubling times in America\" connect with the film's themes such as \"abuse of power, art versus commerce, antiquity versus modernity\".\n\"You look at the statue of liberty at the beginning of the movie and it's upended, it's untethered... the statue of liberty is supposed to represent the very best of what America can be in terms of providing a safe haven and a new life for people,\" he said. \n\"We're betraying that at the moment, in my opinion.\"\nHe added it was \"unapologetic event cinema\", at three-and-a-half hours long, and shot on film.\nHe said there was still \"a long way to go\", but he felt there had been big improvements on film sets.\n\"Thankfully there are far more female camera technicians and cinematographers working now than there were and attitudes on set have become a lot better, behaviour on set has become better,\" he said.\nHe said the story and the people were the biggest factors in picking a project, particularly when spending a minimum of three months away from his LA home, where he lives with his wife, film and TV producer Annie Marter.\nThough he regularly rubs shoulders with A-list talent, he is not immune to being star-struck.\n\"I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan and I have been since I was like 10 years old, growing up on this hillside in Wales listening to the albums my dad had. I've worked with him twice now and each time I'm in awe and just find myself staring at him,\" he said.\n\"And I went to the [Oscars] nominees dinner, and it's like 'hello Ralph Fiennes, hello Kate Blanchett' and this is pretty wild.\"\nOn his bucket list is a sci-fi or space film, \"as long as it's an exploration of the human mind at the same time\" and not \"spectacle cinema for the hell of it\".\nAs for returning to Wales, he has ventured over to show his wife where he grew up and reunite with friends, but would \"like to get back more, for sure\".\n\"It would be remarkable to come back and film something in Wales, and there's a thriving film industry as well now.  So who knows?\"\nFor now, he plans to \"embrace\" the \"rollercoaster\" of the Oscars.",

She started out in the 1970s as a member of the female hip-hop trio The Sequence. \nThe group's most popular song, Funk You Up, peaked at 15 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles. \nHer daughter, who is also a musician and goes by the nickname Ladi Diamond, said on Facebook that she was \"numb\". Hours earlier, she had asked for prayers for her family and said she was on the road. \nA spokesperson for the artist told the BBC that her family had travelled to Montgomery, Alabama, and planned to release more information soon. \nGuy Todd Williams, known as Rahiem in the hip-hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, said about nine other passengers were in a van with Stone at the time of the crash. \n\"She left her indelible mark on the music industry initially as a member of the legendary rap group Sequence,\" Williams said.\nHe said she was the sole fatality in the crash. \nThe BBC has contacted police in Montgomery for details. \nAlong with her music career, Stone also had some success in film. \nShe made her movie debut with a role in The Hot Chick, a 2002 hit starring Rob Schneider, Rachel McAdams and Anna Faris. \nShe also starred in The Fighting Temptations in 2003 with Cuba Gooding Jr and Beyonce.

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise L\u00fcbeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot \u2013 a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

However, the 223ft (68m) ship, which sails between March and November, has experienced some mechanical issues. 'Completely overhauled'An engine problem meant she had to operate on half power for a few days in September 2024 and journey times were increased from two hours 45 mins to four hours.The crane that lifts cargo into the hold also broke last year and mobile cranes were brought in to the quays in Penzance and St Mary's.The Isles of Scilly Steamship Group CEO Stuart Reid said he hoped their problems were behind them. \"Isles of Scilly Steamship GroupThe cargo vessel Menawethen is taking shape in the shipyard in VietnamThe new passenger vessel will have a 24% higher capacity of 600 and stabilisation technology to make her more comfortable in heavy seas.The cargo vessel Menawethen will replace the old Gry Maritha - she is named after one of the 12 uninhabited Eastern Isles.She will have an increased cargo capacity and more space for chilled and frozen goods.Follow BBC Cornwall on X, Facebook and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "YouTube started out as an off-beat video sharing site. But at its 20th anniversary, the platform's content has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with each other.\nIn 2006, Time Magazine named its annual Person of the Year: you. \"Yes you,\" the magazine read. \"You control the Information Age. Welcome to your world.\" Its cover featured a mirror to reflect reader's image \u2013 emblazoned on a computer screen tuned to a site modelled after YouTube. It was just a year after YouTube's launch, but already, it had shifted our understanding of the role we would play in the coming era.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. It's gone from a novel tool to an unshakable pillar of technological infrastructure. Some 2.5 billion people log on every month. The company says people who watch YouTube on their TVs consume a billion hours of video a day, to say nothing of time spent on the app and website. But as much as YouTube changed how we use the internet, it's had an equally significant impact on our offline lives.\n\"Not long ago virtually no one took YouTube that seriously,\" journalist Mark Bergen writes in his book Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"But in so many ways, YouTube had set the stage for modern social media, making decisions throughout its history that shaped how attention, money, ideology, and everything else worked online.\"\nYouTube videos have occupied a massive share of our collective consciousness, dictating what brings us together, what drives us apart, what makes us laugh, cry and cringe. \"All the dynamics of social media \u2013 of attention, fame, disrupting old school media \u2013 have mostly grown because of the financial model YouTube built,\" Bergen tells the BBC. Human nature itself has shifted in the last 20 years, and as seen in these five videos, YouTube would become a nexus point for the way we see ourselves and each other.\nLong before the video stitching on TikTok or remixing on Instagram reels, there was Canon Rock, uploaded just 10 months after YouTube's founding. South Korean musician Jeong-Hyun Lim, known online as funtwo, sits in his bedroom with an electric guitar, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap and pixelated footage. A backing track plays the chords to Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D, and Lim joins in, his guitar work subdued in line with the 300-year-old piece. But Lim's playing \u00a0grows more intricate until, about 40 seconds in, he launches into a blazing solo, fingers gliding across the fretboard.\nThe reaction was explosive. As the video racked up hits, around 900 users sent direct video responses to Canon Rock \u2013 big numbers at a time when uploading videos meant plugging in a digital camera \u2013 and thousands more posted their own covers of the song. In 2007, YouTube user Impeto uploaded a compilation of dozens of Canon Rock videos edited into one continuous track, almost as though the whole internet was playing along together. Deft musicianship wasn't new to the web, but the user participation was.\nCanon Rock created a \"reciprocity between artists\" that opened the door for people to see each other as creative partners, says Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University in the US. By democratising the creative process, YouTube created a melting pot for different communities with different interests and skills to make the internet their own.\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our story on the YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know.\nIt helped inspire a new era of online collaboration, according to Jean Burgess, a digital media professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Videos like funtwo's weren't just a performance, Burgess says, they were an invitation, a \"showcasing of skill and the setting of standards for other players in the 'game' to attain or beat\".\nToday's video platforms bombard us with marketing partnerships and endless threads of political discourse. But the musicians behind Canon Rock represented a simpler time, where collaboration was not an economic or ideological proposition, but instead a space where online bedroom dwellers were learning to see each other as members of a global community, a project they were all embarking on together.\nEarly YouTube audiences will probably be familiar with the saga of Bree, better known by the username lonelygirl15. Her story began as a homeschooled girl posting simple videos about her daily life. But things took a bizarre turn when Bree discovered her family was involved with a strange religious cult. Over the weeks and months, the narrative grew more convoluted; Bree ultimately went on the run, investigating secret codes, eluding religious acolytes and fighting a sinister organisation.\nIt was all fiction, of course. But lonelygirl15's start was so mundane that many didn't question the story until the drama was too fantastic to ignore. \"Bree\" had an enigmatic realness \u2013 she was actively connecting with fans on MySpace and corresponding with journalists, and even the New York Times was still asking whether the series was truth or a hoax before the final episode. It sparked ferocious debate in online forums, with viewers picking apart everything from her narrative to the quality of her video production.\n\"[Lonelygirl15] seemed to captivate so many, drawing people who maybe didn\u2019t know what YouTube really was into the fold,\" says Duffy. \"The authenticity, the relatability, the vulnerability, the expressive sharing.\"\nBeyond satire, the series was a pointed effort to use the tropes and norms of social media to misguide the audience. It marked a major development on the internet, where some realised for the first time just how blurry the lines between fact and fiction had become, Duffy says.\nLonelygirl15 was a sea change for many users' relationships to each other, and it forced some people to examine the identities that they themselves were creating online, Bergen says. \"In some ways, the lonelygirl15 series was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"It was a clever commentary about the fact that authenticity doesn't really exist online \u2013 you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one.\"\nIt raised questions about discerning truth on the web, and helped establish a new order where every post, no matter how innocuous, is subject to interrogation and distrust.\nIt's 2011. A young man sits in front of a map of the world. His hands and voice are shaky as he calls his father on the phone. The man is Randy Phillips, an airman in the US Air Force, and he is filming himself telling his dad that he is gay.\nPhillips ran a channel called \"AreYouSurprised\" detailing his life under the US's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy. In his previous videos, Phillips positioned the camera to keep his face just out of view, but hours after the 16-year policy was repealed, he was on full display. Phillips wasn't the only one. His post was an early example of the \"coming out\" video, a YouTube genre that became more and more influential as time went on.\n\"Watching real LGBTQ+ people share their own coming out journeys across platforms like YouTube definitely provided an opportunity for queer and transgender people all over the world to realise they were not alone,\" says Zach Eisenstein, director of communications at The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\u00a0\"When YouTube was just starting up, I was a teenager figuring out my own identity,\" he says. \"It helped me exponentially as I navigated my own coming out journey.\"\nThe offline world was in the throes of change. It would be four years until the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, but following a global economic recession that highlighted growing inequality and shifting political climates, social attitudes were becoming more inclusive.\nTyler Oakley, one of the first major openly gay personalities on the platform, launched the \"Coming Out\" challenge in 2011, encouraging his audience and fellow creators to proudly share their sexual orientations and experiences. YouTubers like Hannah Hart, Ingrid Nilsen and singer Troye Sivan garnered a collective 2.8 million views on their coming out videos. Olympic diver Tom Daley came out in a 2013 video, receiving support from his fans and fellow athletes.\n\"People find creators that speak to them, and very often watch them and get to know them and trust them and are influenced by them in a way that no other platform touches,\" says Ben Relles, former head of comedy at YouTube and cofounder of the YouTube channel Barely Political. The way we present ourselves differs between coworkers, family, friends and strangers, but YouTube circumvented those social links. LGBTQ+ creators leveraged the relationships \u00a0with their audiences to make it plain that people with different sexual identities did not just exist, they were no different than every other person.\n\"Through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the internet, social media has given people a unique ability to find safe and welcoming online communities \u2013 especially when they don\u2019t feel accepted in their in-person ones,\" Eisenstein says.\n\"This is for my 12-year-old self,\" begins Australian YouTuber Essena O'Neill in what she called her last ever YouTube video in 2015. Over the next 17 minutes, O'Neill broke down her decision to quit all social media and made a passionate plea to her followers to do the same. O'Neill's story took aim at the \"contrived\" reality of video and social media production, and its harmful effects on mental health. It was a sign of things to come.\n\"Running a channel is very much like running a treadmill,\" says Matt Koval, a filmmaker and YouTube's former head creator liaison. \"If you stop, if you get off the treadmill for a long period of time, your viewers are going to move on and start watching other people just by nature, and it can be difficult to come back.\" And many creators, even as far back as YouTube's early days, never did.\nQuitting videos have become a social media subgenre unto themselves in the past decade \u2013 people in the public eye realising that they've taken on too much, or that they need a break. But O'Neill's departure helped spark a broader conversation.\n\"People are so dismissive of influencers and creators,\" says Duffy. \"What creative workers experience really presages wider trends in the economy.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\nIt wasn't just creators facing burnout online. In the early days, social media was sold as utopian opportunity, a place where people would come together to share ideas beyond the constraints of traditional gatekeepers. But as time went by, a new discussion emerged about social media's potentially addictive qualities and negative effects on our time, attention and mental health.\nThanks in part to a push from creators like O'Neill, who offered their own experience as a model, conversations about our own relationships to the internet began to shift. Ten years later, we've reached the point the point that officials describe social media as a full on public health crisis \u2013 but that shift in thinking hasn't been enough to keep people off the internet. Social media usage on YouTube and elsewhere is higher than ever, and these days, O'Neill herself is back online.\nA spokesperson for Google, YouTube's parent company, says the platform works hard to ensure it's providing a healthy and fulfilling network, both for creators and users who just come to watch. \"Each YouTube creator has a different definition of success, and we have support mechanisms in place and continue to build a community that allows creators to thrive based on their individual needs and business aspirations,\" the spokesperson says. \"We want creators to make their videos in a healthy, sustainable way, and creating engaging content should always take priority over producing a certain quantity of videos.\" YouTube has invested in a number of efforts to promote mental health among its users and across the globe.\nMore people than ever were watching YouTube videos in the 2010s, with the site averaging one billion users a month by 2013, according to the company. But as YouTubers became more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, some of those feelings turned towards the platform itself.\nFor years, YouTube released an annual recap video looking back at the service's biggest cultural trends. What began as a one-and-a-half-minute round-up turned into big budget productions, bringing together a growing roster of notable creators and celebrities recreating viral moments set to remixed tracks of hit songs. It was a fairly well-received \u2013 until 2018.\nWithin a week, YouTube Rewind 2018 racked up over 10 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube post of all time. Critics panned the video, including the CEO of YouTube's own daughter, arguing the company was promoting a self-serving view of the platform geared towards its own corporate interests, one that glossed how people were actually using and responding to the service. \"The community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\" reporter Julia Alexander wrote at the time. The speed and scope of the reaction was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\"For a long time, YouTube has been pretty tolerant of its creators' and audiences' criticisms. I think that's the sort of atmosphere where it's totally permissible for the audience to get really mad at the company,\" says Bergen. But \"the company has never been great at reading the room\".\nDespite the criticism, YouTube maintains that it's an inclusive space built to allow its community to thrive and feel empowered. \"YouTube has not only democratized content, but democratized opportunity,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"At YouTube, we developed a comprehensive approach aimed to ensure we\u2019re a video streaming platform for high-quality content.\" That includes a set of robust community guidelines, the spokesperson says, one the company works to apply equally to all users in order to combat the spread of harmful content and build a healthy environment that lets users flourish.\nRewind 2018 revealed a festering hostility that grew in the online space. \"There was a marked shift,\" Duffy says. In the earliest days, discussions about YouTube centered around the idea that it promoted a culture of positivity. YouTube's original slogan was \"Broadcast Yourself\" \u2013 creators and users saw the website as a project they were all working on together. But as time wore on, an adversarial tone erupted on the platform, Duffy says, and many started to feel the YouTube they helped build had become too powerful.\nThe biggest change, perhaps, was how people understood the role they played on the platform; once they were creating YouTube, but now, they were just using it.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

That's what I feel. There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. He was born in north-east London to a father who ran a sweet shop and a mother who was a secretary. \"That's what I wanted. That's what I thought I could do. That's what I enjoyed.\"\nEnjoying the spotlight was just a part of his success. Sir Derek notes that after he found himself at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (which he affectionately calls the Rep) in 1960, there wasn't anything else that matched the euphoria of basking in an audience's applause. It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped for. Like most, they'd expected their son to go into a field with stability, like accounting or insurance.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"I always thought\u2026 I wanted to be an actor. I had no talent for anything else,\" he says. \"Hamlet confirmed it.\" After reciting one of the doomed prince's monologues to Kay, Sir Derek admits that most of his roles have disappeared into the ether, but the work of the Bard has stayed with him since those early performances almost 70 years ago. \"All the other parts have gone. Hamlet's still around. Shakespeare stays.\"\nSir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens. But he's as quick to note that he didn't have the classical training many of them had. He tells Kay that it was a bit of luck that led to his successes, which include being knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II and earning the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\"I think there's talent and I think there's luck. Without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own,\" he says. \"You've got to have the opportunity to show you've got talent. Without that opportunity\u2026 nobody's seeing it.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\u00a0\nAnother obstacle Jacobi notes was the fact that he was never seen as classically handsome. \"They had a head start because they were nice to look at,\" he says of Stephens and Olivier, while he credits being able to hone his craft in front of an audience from the age of 17 as what set him apart. He tells Kay that luck landed him that first job and his time at the Rep stood in for drama school. \"It was a huge learning experience.\"\nAnd although Sir Derek says he hasn't stopped learning, he works at a different pace now, and has learned to find new ways of working.\n\"You slow down,\" the 86-year-old says. \"It's more difficult to remember lines. I used to have a very sharp brain. I don't anymore. That, obviously, is age.\" These days, he has some help with those lines via an earpiece just in case, with Kay likening it to a skier using a knee brace.\u00a0\n\"I've really had a charmed life,\" Sir Derek says, reflecting on his career, his long-time husband, theatre director Richard Clifford, and the fact that he can still do what he loves. Sir Derek's upcoming projects include appearances in episodes of Doctor Who Unbound and Good Omens as well as films The Vampyre: Blood & Ink, with Malcolm McDowell and action-comedy Tinsel Town, alongside Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\"I can't complain about anything in my life.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. \"Jack FlynnActor Derek Jacobi discusses his time on the stage and screen with Katty Kay (Credit: Jack Flynn)Sir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens.",

Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket. Were England to find a way, their rebuild could gain a jump start.",

Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.\nSabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards. \nArriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.\nBetter still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set. \nA former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).\nHopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short n' Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.\nLiam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.\nGossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Zayn and Louis both on tour, that seems unlikely.\nAccording to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".\nQuoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.\n\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"\nIt's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.\n\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony. \n\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"\nHe's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.\nBut in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".\n\nWith 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT. International viewers can watch the show on the official Brits YouTube channel.\nBBC News will be live from the red carpet from 16:30GMT - with a live page providing coverage throughout the night. \nArtist of the year\nGroup of the year\nAlbum of the Year\nRead the full list of nominees here.\n",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.\nBut after Zelensky left early following a fiery exchange with Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the White House announced that the deal had not been signed.\nZelensky previously said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no US security guarantees had yet been agreed - something he had been pushing for.\nTrump had said a deal would help US taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war, but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning.\nThe preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction. \nShmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\". \nThe agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law. \nDisagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what appears to be a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.\n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nBut on Wednesday, he said no such guarantee had been made. \n\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" the Ukrainian leader explained. \nAsked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.\n\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"\nDespite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nHe said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.\nTrump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", adding that responsibility for this would now fall to Europe. \nBut he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".\nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\". \nThe US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.\nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced that the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is now unclear when the deal might be signed, if at all.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nVladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed.\nBut on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.\nCommenting on Zelensky's visit to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday: \"Whether it will be [to sign] the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet.\"",

        "article_text": "Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.\nFor those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.\n\"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,\" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.\n\"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live.\"\nYulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.\nBefore the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.\nBefore Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.\n\"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,\" says 30-year-old Andriy. \"They don't respect the people of Ukraine.\"\n\"It looks like Washington supports Russia!\" observes Dmytro, 26.\nYou wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.\n\"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,\" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.\nWorld leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.\nHis ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.\nBut Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.\nNot least with his warming to Russia.\nThe initial reaction was that of shock,\" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.\n\"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,\" she adds. \"It's painful.\"\nUkrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.\nPerhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.\n\"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,\" argues Sovsun.\nThere are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.\n\"It's important to find the right mediator,\" she says. \"Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.\n\"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy.\"\nPresident Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.\n\"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,\" she adds. \"Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war.\"\nWhat the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.\n\"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,\" she says.\nWhile there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.\nHer European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.\nHe was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as \"threats to national security\" and \"creating obstacles to economic development\". Mr Poroshenko said it was \"politically motivated\".\nDespite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.\nAs sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.\nRussia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.\n\"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,\" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.\nAfter Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,\" he says.\nAs he ruthlessly pursues his \"America First\" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.\n\"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,\" says Mr Chmut.\n\"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Svitlana Libet.",

But I also know that timing and determination counts,\" von der Leyen said in Delhi, adding that such an agreement would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world. \nThe EU Commission chief is in India accompanied by the entire College of Commissioners -  the first such visit after the European parliamentary elections in June 2024. \nShe met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. \nSpeaking in the Indian capital, she said the two sides wanted to deepen trade and investment collaboration in wide ranging areas like semiconductors, AI and cleantech. \nIndia and EU relaunched talks on a long pending free trade agreement in 2021 and are set to hold another round in March.\nAn India-EU summit is also being held later in the year. \nVon der Leyen also said that India and EU were pushing for renewed cooperation in security and stability and were exploring a future 'Security and Defence Partnership' with India similar to the partnerships with Japan and South Korea.\nBrussels is keen to expand its relationships in the Indo-Pacific as cracks deepen between the US and Europe over trade tariffs and Ukraine following Donald Trump's return to the White House.\nTrump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the US\".\nThe European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".\nGiven the backdrop, analysts say strong trade and security relations with India have become more important than ever for the EU.\nA trade deal has proven difficult so far due to differences in areas like agriculture and manufacturing. \nDespite renewed negotiations \"the two sides have little to show for the talks thus far\", Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think tank, said in a note.\nHowever, some 6,000 EU companies operate in India and the bloc is India's largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral trade reaching $135bn (\u00a3107bn) in 2022-23, nearly doubling in the last decade.\nAfter years of scepticism about free trade deals, India is now actively signing agreements and negotiating with multiple countries and blocs.\nIndia and the UK restarted free trade talks this week, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries.\nLast year, India signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.",

Despite renewed negotiations \"the two sides have little to show for the talks thus far\", Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think tank, said in a note.However, some 6,000 EU companies operate in India and the bloc is India's largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral trade reaching $135bn (\u00a3107bn) in 2022-23, nearly doubling in the last decade.After years of scepticism about free trade deals, India is now actively signing agreements and negotiating with multiple countries and blocs.India and the UK restarted free trade talks this week, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries.Last year, India signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.Ursula von der LeyenNarendra ModiIndiaEuropean UnionTrade Von der Leyen also said that India and EU were pushing for renewed cooperation in security and stability and were exploring a future 'Security and Defence Partnership' with India similar to the partnerships with Japan and South Korea.Brussels is keen to expand its relationships in the Indo-Pacific as cracks deepen between the US and Europe over trade tariffs and Ukraine following Donald Trump's return to the White House.Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the US\".The European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".Given the backdrop, analysts say strong trade and security relations with India have become more important than ever for the EU.A trade deal has proven difficult so far due to differences in areas like agriculture and manufacturing. \"I am well aware it will not be easy. India and EU relaunched talks on a long pending free trade agreement in 2021 and are set to hold another round in March.An India-EU summit is also being held later in the year.",

        "article_text": "\"I grew up round here thinking I could not wait to get out,\" says 51-year-old Dan Davies.\n\"And then I used to come back up from London on a weekly basis and would see half the place boarded up and going downhill fast.\"\nNew Brighton, on the northern tip of the Wirral peninsula in Merseyside, was once a booming holiday destination boasting the longest promenade in the country, a pier and a tower bigger than Blackpool's.\nBut in the mid-1980s, after cheap package deals to Spain had become the first choice for many holidaymakers, New Brighton found itself struggling to keep up, and photographer Martin Parr's famous 1986 collection The Last Resort depicted it as a scruffy, litter-strewn town whose glory days were behind it.\nNow, though, it is undergoing a huge renaissance: in 2020 house prices rose faster in New Brighton than anywhere else in the country, investment is returning and businesses are thriving.\nSo how does a place go from being somewhere people cannot wait to leave to somewhere people cannot move to fast enough?\nFran Barrett, 35, returned to New Brighton after going away to London to study and work as a journalist.\n\"When you're a kid you never want to live where you're growing up,\" she said. \n\"But I realised as I got older why it was such a great place to live.\"\nWhile many of Fran's friends who stayed in London were still trying to get on the property ladder, she and her husband and toddler son were able to move up a rung in 2021 because of the \u00a330,000 they made in profit on their terraced home.\n\"It just has a real community feel to it,\" said Fran. \n\"There are so many new businesses springing up, and if you've got kids there are so many great little parks. \n\"A lot of my friends from other parts of the Wirral are moving here, too.\"\nAnd they all need places to eat, drink and shop. \nFran's sister Lou runs the caf\u00e9 bar and gift shop SUP, just one of many independent businesses that have sprung up in the town in recent years.\nA few hundred yards away from SUP is the James Atherton pub, which takes its name from the resort's founder who, in the 1830s, set about creating a northern version of Sussex seaside town Brighton.\nThe pub made national headlines in 2020 when it was renamed in a disparaging tribute to Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings and their three-tier coronavirus lockdown restrictions.\nIt is one of a number of buildings in Victoria Road that Dan's company Rockpoint Leisure revived.\nTo \"keep out the big boys\", as he puts it, the company bought up parcels of land and buildings and made sure independent shops, cafes and art spaces were able to move in. \nThe walls of many of them are now festooned with large murals by artists both local and global.\n\"We wanted to demonstrate that you don't need big outside consultants to come in and tell you what you need, you need a sustainable plan that can protect a place like New Brighton.\n\"We did that, and we have become the number one model for seaside town regeneration,\" he says.\nVictoria Road is a haven of independent businesses. \nThe Hatch art gallery opened in an old greengrocer's shop and took its name from the hatch through which people were served during the pandemic.\n\"Seaside towns are absolutely having a renaissance,\" says owner Anneley Pickles, 51. \n\"They just need things that will bring people here, whether that's food or entertainment, or workshops or arts spaces.\"\nJust up the road is Tallulah's Emporium, which owner Wayne Saunders describes as a \"listening space\" after the model of the Japanese kissa bars that specialise in playing jazz records.\nWayne, 51, left New Brighton in 1989, at a time when \"numerous friends from primary school had ended up dead or in prison\".\nHe moved to London, where he opened the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Shoreditch, before returning to New Brighton to open up Tallulah's in 2022.\nHe agrees with Dan's assessment that New Brighton is, with its thriving independent scene, \"Wirral's Brooklyn to Liverpool's Manhattan\".\nThere are not many remnants of New Brighton's past as a Victorian and Edwardian seaside town still visible today. \nThe tower was pulled down and sold for scrap in the 1920s, while the ballroom was gutted by fire in 1969 and then demolished.\nBut the town has always remained a seaside resort. \nIn 2011, the Marine Point development opened at an estimated cost of about \u00a365m, bringing a cinema, hotel, bars and restaurants to the seafront. \nIt stands a short distance from the Fort Perch Rock coastal defence battery \u2013 now a museum \u2013 which was built in the 1820s to protect Liverpool from foreign naval attack, and the Adventureland amusement complex which was built about 100 years later and which has been mooted for redevelopment as apartments in recent years.\nJayne Casey, a former member of punk band Big In Japan, now runs a small deli and arts bar District House just around the corner in Victoria Road.\nNow 68, she remembers the New Brighton of the 1980s that was encapsulated in Parr's Last Resort collection, and believes that, generally, the photos captured the area quite well.\n\"It was where people from Liverpool and the Wirral came for a cheap day out,\" she says.\n\"It had a beautiful 1930s outdoor swimming pool, and had that classic seaside town look to it.\n\"It was a place that working-class people came en-masse in the time when the factories closed down for a week and everyone had a week at the seaside.\"\nToday the resort is still popular with day trippers and families. \nAnd according to one person who was involved in its regeneration over the last decade, attempts to broaden what the town had to offer were not always met with open arms.\n\"There was a feeling from some that New Brighton is just about grandparents bringing their grandkids for day out,\" they said. \n\"But there were those who felt it was about more than just Fort Perch Rock and the promenade.\"\nJane, who helped transform a wilderness of empty warehouses near the Liverpool waterfront into the arts and tech enclave now known as the Baltic Triangle, says that while art and culture are playing a big part in New Brighton's renaissance and transformation, the town is not being \"gentrified\".\nGentrification is the process through which working-class urban populations find themselves displaced and priced out of their own communities.\n\"Yes, house prices have gone up and new people have come in but I don't think any kind of mass gentrification has happened,\" she says. \n\"But,\" she warns, \"there are some big sites that could come up and then could become apartment blocks and flats.\"\nNew Brighton's promenade \u2013 the longest in Britain \u2013 will be most familiar to those outside the north-west of England as the location of a Channel 4 ident that includes the TV network's logo running to keep pace with a group of wheelchair racers.\nNext month, the documentary I Am Martin Parr will be screened at The Light cinema, part of the Marine Point complex which looms over the promenade where that clip was filmed and where one of Parr's most infamous shots was taken.\nJose Wilmin, who has been coming to New Brighton for more than 60 years from her home in Ellesmere Port, has witnessed the resort going through its ups and downs in that time.\n\"It used to be a proper holiday place, there was a massive outdoor pool, a big funfair and the main street was just packed with bucket-and-spade shops,\" the 68-year-old says.\nWhile she says it is great to see New Brighton \"on the up again\", she has been a regular through good times and bad.\n\"I've always come here, to have fish and chips and watch the world go by.\n\"It's where I used to come with my mum. It's where all my memories were made.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

        "article_text": "Since her debut in the 1976 remake of King Kong, Jessica Lange has never shied away from hard work.\nA double Oscar winner for 1982's Tootsie, and 1994's Blue Sky, she's starred in roles as eclectic as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Cape Fear, Rob Roy, Big Fish and Broken Flowers.\nOn television she played Joan Crawford in Feud, took home an Emmy for Grey Gardens and a stash of awards for one of the many roles she played in the American Horror Story franchise.\nBut she's also a familiar figure on the stage \u2013 in London and on Broadway \u2013 where she's appeared in classics A Streetcar Named Desire, The Glass Menagerie and Mother Play.\nAnd it's that ability to cross between stage and screen, classic plays and pulp fiction, which means that everything she attaches herself to is guaranteed a loyal audience.\nHer latest film is an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. The Pulitzer Prize winning play was written in 1940 but not staged until after O'Neill's death in 1956.\nA semi-autobiographical work dedicated to his wife, O'Neill described it as \"play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\"\n\"It has not been an easy project to get off the ground,\" Lange admits.\n\"This is a throwback to another kind of filmmaking and another kind of storytelling but in my mind this is the greatest American play ever written.\n\"It has this universality, this emotional depth. You'd be hard pressed not to relate to something in it, especially in the world we live in now.\"\nShe plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of an American family who's addicted to morphine since the birth of her sons, who struggles with loneliness and fears about her boys' health.\n\"Mary Tyrone is one of these parts which mean the world to me,\" says Lange.\n\"It may sound corny but I love her. It's thrilling as an actor to have a part like this.\"\nShe's played the role twice before on stage and it's the 2016 Broadway version, directed by Jonathan Kent, which has been brought to the screen. \nFilming wrapped in 2022 but it's only now that Lange and co-star Ed Harris have been able to premiere it in Dublin and Glasgow.\nShe arrived at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday just as Tim Roth, who appeared in the opening film Tornado, departed.\nThe two actors were in the 1995 film Rob Roy, she as Mary McGregor, wife of Liam Neeson's Rob Roy, and he as the villainous Archibald Cunningham.\nAnd while Roth's abiding memories were of his war with the Highland midgie, Lange recalls a much more pleasant experience.\n\"It was such a marvellous time, up in the Highlands where I'd never spent time before and it was extraordinarily beautiful,\" she says.\n\"I had the whole family here and the kids had a whole life of their own going on.\n\"It was a very special time and I liked the film.

        "article_text": "This year's Oscars had it all - glamour, tears and the Wicked stars defying gravity. Here are some of the top moments from the biggest night in Hollywood.\nThere was an audible gasp from journalists in the winners' room when Mikey Madison was announced as the best actress winner. \nDemi Moore was the favourite for much of this campaign. Things did shift after Madison's Bafta win, but the race remained incredibly tight.\nIn the end, it was Madison's night. It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.\nEdie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.\nShe added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.\nWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.\nAs Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.\nThe co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.\nEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film.\n\"It's giving chandelier,\" one reporter said to me backstage.\nOn social media the big question was: \"How is she going to sit down in that dress?\"\nOn the red carpet, there was quite a moment when Halle Berry ran up to Adrien Brody and gave him a big kiss. \nIt recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.\nShe told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".\nSpeaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.\nThe Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".\nBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.\nInside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.\nReality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to... Brody.\nActor Adam Sandler was in on the ongoing jokes about his typically casual attire.\nEarly on in the night, host Conan O'Brien called him out, saying he was \"dressed like a guy playing video poker at 2am\".\n(For reference, Sandler was in the audience wearing a blue hoodie and shorts, an ensemble that looked more at home on the basketball court).\nFollowing a playful back and forth between the two, the actor walked into the aisle of the theatre and said he was \"leaving\" before going over to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and shouting his surname, in the way he previously did on Saturday Night Live.\nChalamet, ever good natured, laughed along.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which killed 29 people. \nThe Grammys and Golden Globes both made the fires a central theme of the show.\nThe Academy Awards mentioned it only a handful of times, signalling Hollywood is moving on.\nThere was, however, one powerful moment, when O'Brien welcomed some of the firefighters who fought the blazes on stage. He called them \"heroes\", with the audience clapping and giving the emergency workers a standing ovation.\nO'Brien then said there are some jokes that even he isn't brave enough to tell - and asked some of the firefighters to read them out instead. \nLA Fire Captain Erik Scott read one joke off a teleprompter that said their hearts go out to everyone who lost their homes - including the makers of Joker 2.\nIt got a big laugh and O'Brien called it the best joke delivery of the night.\nIt was Zoe Salda\u00f1a's first Oscar, winning best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez - a musical about a transgender Mexican drug lord - and it marked one of the most powerful and emotional speeches of the night. \nShe broke down in tears immediately, crying out \"Mommy\", to her mother in the audience.\n\"I am floored by this honour,\" she wept, paying tribute to her fellow nominees for their \"loving and community\", saying \"I will pay it forward\".\nPraising the film's cast and crew, she got emotional as she talked about her family.\n\"Everything brave, outrageous and good I've ever done in my life is because of you,\" she said, praising her husband, his \"beautiful hair\" and their three sons.\n\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961 - I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands.\n\"I'm the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award and I know I won't be the last.\n\"Getting an award where I got to sing and speak in Spanish - this is for my grandmother.\"\nThe month-long saga to obtain a US visa by two Iranian filmmakers ended in the pair winning the best animated short film Academy Award - with them rushing to even make the ceremony in Hollywood. \nHossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani arrived at Los Angeles airport just hours before the Oscars award ceremony was due to begin.\nAfter their plane landed, they quickly changed outfits in a public restroom and made it with only moments to go before winning the award for their film, In the Shadow of the Cypress.\n\"It's not our fault we are so late,\" Sohani said to BBC News before the show. \"We couldn't get a visa. It's a difficult relationship\" between the US and Iran, she explained.\n\"Until yesterday we hadn't obtained our visa and now we are standing here with this statuette in our hands,\" said Molayemi in his acceptance speech.\n\"Speaking in front of this expectant audience is very hard for us,\" he added. \"Yes, if we preserve and remain faithful, miracles will happen.\"\nAs ever, politics reared its head during Sunday night's ceremony.\nHost O'Brien made a quip about how Anora was \"having a good night\", before saying: \"I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian.\"\nO'Brien must have been writing his monologue up to the very last minute, because the joke appeared to be a nod to the White House spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump.\nMeanwhile, the No Other Land documentary team descended on the red carpet wearing Palestinian scarves and Kufiya. Their film is set in the occupied West Bank. After they won for the film, the team took the stage and called out US policy in the region.\nKill Bill star Daryl Hannah also veered into politics while on stage. She referenced the war in Ukraine, saying \"Slava Ukraini\", the country's salute, as she presented an award.\nBut one person wasn't mentioned. \nHere in liberal Hollywood, you may have expected jokes and barbs toward Donald Trump - but his name didn't come up even once.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's president had been hoping to leave the White House on Friday after positive talks with Donald Trump, capped with the signing of a minerals deal giving the US a real stake in his country's future, if not an outright security guarantee.\nInstead Volodymyr Zelensky faced an extraordinary dressing down in front of the world's media, after President Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance demanded that he show more gratitude for years of US support.\nThe Ukrainian president pushed back at suggestions from his more powerful partners that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. They responded that he was being \"disrespectful\".\nZelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early before he and Trump could even take the stage for a scheduled news conference.\nAnd the minerals deal, which had been trailed and praised by both sides this week, was left unsigned. \"Come back when you're ready for peace,\" Trump wrote on social media shortly before Zelensky's car pulled away.\nThere were several major flashpoints in the meeting. Here are four of the most fiery - and the politics and feeling that lies behind them.\nWhile there was half an hour of cordial talks and formalities at the start, tensions began to boil over in the Oval Office when Vance said the \"path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy\".\n\"That's what President Trump is doing,\" he said.\nZelensky interjected, referencing Russia's aggression in the years before its full-scale invasion three years ago including a failed ceasefire in 2019. \"Nobody stopped him,\" he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you talking about? What do you mean?\" he said. \nThe exchange then became visibly tense, with Vance replying: \"the kind that will end the destruction of your country.\"\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the American media.\nIt was Vance's defence of Trump's approach to ending the war - by opening communications with Putin and pushing for a quick ceasefire - that first escalated tensions with the Ukrainian leader.\nAfter Vance challenged the Ukrainian president over problems he's had with the military and conscription, Zelensky replied: \"During the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have a nice ocean and don't feel [it] now, but you will feel it in the future.\"\nThat comment rankled Trump and drew him into the clash that up until this point had been limited to Zelensky and the vice-president.\nHere was the Ukrainian leader suggesting Trump had failed to grasp the moral hazard of dealing with the war's aggressor.\nZelensky's message cut to the heart of what critics say is Trump's fundamental miscalculation in dealing with Russia. That by ending Moscow's isolation and seeking a quick ceasefire he risks emboldening Putin, weakening Europe and leaving Ukraine open to being devoured.\nTrump tends to characterise the war as a kind of binary conflict between two sides who should both take their share of burden or blame for the fighting and its causes.\nBut Zelensky was trying to warn of catastrophic consequences of this thinking. This was the Ukrainian leader directly telling Trump in the Oval Office: Appease Russia, and the war will come to you.\nIt triggered Trump's biggest backlash. \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel. You're in no position to dictate that,\" he said, his voice getting louder.\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" he told him. \"You're gambling with millions of lives.\"\nThis exchange may win Zelensky plaudits among those who wanted to see him to stand up to Trump; but this moment could also decide an era of war and peace in Europe.\nAt one point later in the conversation, Zelensky said: \"From the very beginning of the war, we have been alone and we are thankful.\"\nThis angered Trump, who has repeatedly framed the war as a drain on American taxpayers.\n\"You haven't been alone,\" he said. \"You haven't been alone. We gave you - through this stupid president - $350bn,\" Trump said, a reference to Biden.\nVance then asked whether Zelensky had thanked the US during the meeting and accused him of campaigning \"for the opposition\" - the Democrats - during the US election last year.\nThe comment was a reference to a visit Zelensky made to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania - Joe Biden's hometown - just weeks before Americans headed to the polls in the November election.\nRepublicans were outraged at the visit, accusing Zelensky of turning the tour into a partisan campaign event on Kamala Harris's behalf in a battleground state.\nHere was all the bitter division of America's own polarised internal politics pouring into the room at a critical moment for future of global security.\n\"Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war,\" Zelensky began saying, only for Trump to cut him off.\n\"He's not speaking loudly,\" Trump shot back, visibly irritated. \"Your country's in big trouble.\"\n\"You're not winning, you're not winning this,\" Trump said. \"You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.\"\n\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" said Trump. \"It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change.\"\nThe president and vice-president reprimanded Zelensky, appearing most angered by what they perceived as his \"attitude\". \n\"Just say thank you,\" Vance demanded at one point.\nZelensky's responses - which were to fact check the two far more powerful men and argue his corner - seemed driven by the existential nature of this moment. \nHe has spent three years defending his country from invasion, while also trying to hold together a society and its political leadership that Putin has tried to drive apart. \nBut out of the main camera shot was another sight in the room. Zelensky's  ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, who was spotted with her head in her hands as the arguments escalated. \nIt is an image that sums up the diplomatic position for Zelensky and his relationship with - until now at least - his superpower sponsor in trying to repel Russia. \nStanding up to Trump like he did on Friday could, ultimately, mean losing to Putin.",

        "article_text": "Jessica Sergis scored a hat-trick of second-half tries - as Australia scored 17 in total\nAmy Hardcastle compared the experience to being in a washing machine. Jodie Cunningham said it was evidence of the work English women's rugby league still has to do.\nEngland's experience in Las Vegas could hardly have been more chastening. A 90-4 defeat by Australia was the biggest the Lionesses - either as England or Great Britain - have ever suffered.\nBoth captain Cunningham and centre Hardcastle, interviewed on the pitch moments after a shattering result, were quick to pinpoint the reasons for it: they couldn't get enough of the ball, and so ended up spending much of the 70 minutes trying to defend against the best team in the world.\nHow to use that as a learning experience to avoid a repeat is a tougher question - and one that goes to the heart of the structure of women's rugby league in England.\nThe effort from Stuart Barrow's team never wavered, even as hopes of running their opponents close were shredded. The fact they scored the final try of the match, having conceded 17 before that, spoke volumes of their capacity to keep going.\nThat, in itself, required huge reserves of character.\n\"I think we know what we need to do when we go back home,\" Hardcastle said. \"You can't take anything away from the Jillaroos. \n\"They're absolute athletes and what they get to do in Australia, and how professional they are, and the backing that they get is incredible. And to face them at a top level, it's a privilege to be here.\n\"We've lost, but to be able to be here and give it a go and know what it's like in that battle, in that washing machine, it's been worth that 70 minutes.\"\nThe size of the defeat clearly hurt.\n\"There are always positives to take,\" Cunningham said. \"Right now, it's tough to focus on them, but I think the heart was there, the effort was there, we didn't give up. \n\"I think Georgia Roche getting a try for us right at the end shows that we didn't give up. The effort was there. It was just that they were too good for us. \n\"But I'm proud of the girls. I'm proud of how they kept going and sometimes that's what you've got to take at international rugby.\"\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nAustralia score 90 points against England in Las Vegas - as it happened\nJodie Cunningham acknowledged England did not have enough of the ball against Australia\nIn an interview with Sky Sports before the match, Cunningham had highlighted the gulf in investment between the women's domestic game in Australia and England.\nShe had pointed out how the players in the NRL Women's Premiership (NRLW) were either full-time or semi-professional, while those in England's Women's Super League play for expenses or nothing at all.\nThat gulf was on show at the Allegiant Stadium, as a ruthless Australia side kept on punishing their opponents.\nAnd it provided a significant reality check as England start building towards next year's World Cup.\n\"It shows where women's rugby league's at,\" Cunningham said. \"The growth that's happened over recent years, the investment that's gone into the NRLW is there to see, with the athletes they have and what you can see on show today. \n\"We've got a lot of work to do. But we've got a great squad, we've got a great group of staff and we're willing to put that hard work in to get better.\"\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sport, former Great Britain head coach Jackie Sheldon highlighted the investment Australia have put into their women's game over the past two decades as a key factor in their international dominance - they have won the past three World Cups, and lost just once since 2016.\nShe suggested England have to find a way to compete physically with Australia and New Zealand in order to be able to challenge them.\nGiven the disparity in investment between the domestic game in England and Australia, that may not be a quick process. It may be helped, though, by the experience gained by English players who have moved to the NRLW: Roche plays her club rugby for Newcastle Knights, and Hollie-Mae Dodd for Canberra Raiders, while Paige Travis will start the coming season with Parramatta Eels, having switched from St Helens.\nPerhaps, in time, the painful memories of Vegas will make England better too. As Hardcastle put it: \"The result's hard, but there's a lot we can look at individually, and think: what do we need to do to be better?\"",

Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.\nThe narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".\nPerhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.\nThis strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes. \nThe UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.\nWhile the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.\nThe White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.\nLikewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.\nThis appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.\nThe prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.\nCould the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?\nThere are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.\nAnd even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.\nThat is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.\nThe PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.\nThe strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one.",

a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.\nJapan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.\nMonster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.\n\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.\n\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"\nOther Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.\nRyu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020. \nThe company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time. \nThis can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.\nThe Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way. \nMore recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.\nAt last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.\nMr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".\nThat includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.\n\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.\nJapan does face some of the same challenges as other developers worldwide.\nPlayer habits are changing, with PC gaming increasing in popularity, and as technology becomes more advanced making games becomes more expensive.\nMr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\". \n\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"\nThe games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.\nIt leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.\nMr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.\n\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.\n\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"\nFor an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.\n\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.\n\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs.

        "summary": "He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.In addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states. \"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.Kennedy stays mum on vaccinesBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination.

She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California.\n\"It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren't even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,\" she says.\n\"If I'm honest, I didn't think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn't even anything major.\n\"So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family.\n\"I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn't have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family.\"\nThe day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself.\nIt was a period she describes as \"one of the hardest times in my life\".\nShe says: \"It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game.\n\"I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out.\n\"My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego.\"\nCasey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018\nIt took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney's consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and \"our lives\". They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim.\n\"[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time.\"\nShe also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities.\n\"It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn't have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds.\"\nThe ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women's Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time.\nBut then along came the Canada job.\nAt first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she \"loves\", which is working with players day to day.\nYet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months.\n\"I really liked that it was extensive,\" she says. \"It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me.\"\nThat included speaking to the manager of the men's team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game.\nAnd she was impressed \u2013 by the organisation's leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role.\n\"When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn't have to move,\" she said.\n\"That's been really, really beneficial for us as a family. I don't think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you're in a privileged position, but it's the impact on your family it has.\n\"I had young children that just didn't understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I'd contributed to that, which was difficult.\n\"There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn't have a job. There were some I would have been interested in, some I wouldn't have been interested in, but as soon as I got involved in this process it became clear I was really interested in this [and] I was only committed to one thing.\"\nCasey Stoney took charge of Canada for the first time in February, overseeing two wins and one draw in the Pinatar Cup in Spain\nShe is taking over a country who are ranked sixth in the world but have experienced their own turmoil.\nDuring last summer's Paris Olympics, in which Canada reached the quarter-finals, two members of the team's coaching staff were sent home for flying a drone over a training session held by New Zealand, their opponents in a group game.\nTheir head coach Bev Priestman, another Englishwoman, was given a year-long ban by world governing body Fifa and Canada - who had won Olympic gold at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games - were docked six points.\nPriestman \"did reach out and wish me luck\" says Stoney, but they have had no other communication and the new Canada coach is keen to focus on the future, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon.\nShe met the majority of her players for the first time over the last two weeks as Canada competed in a four-team tournament, the Pinatar Cup, in Spain, which they won following a 7-0 thrashing of Chinese Taipei, a 2-0 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with China.\n\"This team excites me,\" she says. \"I do think they've got so much potential.\n\"What they were able to achieve last year in difficult circumstances shows what they're capable of, but there's so much more to come.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

Even now Sarah says she can feel out of place in the music industry.\n\"The music industry is so based on genre, and sometimes I've felt like people look at me and they're like, 'oh, you can't really work on this or that'.\n\"I've definitely really struggled with it. It's been really hard.\"\nThe latest diversity report by UK Music recorded that in 2024, 7.6% of people working in the music industry identified as Asian. \nThe group represents all sectors of the industry and noted there had been \"positive movement in the right direction\", with people from minority backgrounds now representing more than 25% of the workforce - up from 15.6% when the survey started in 2016. \n\"Nonetheless barriers still exist and we must continue to seek change,\" the report said.\n\"There is a lot of misunderstanding and lack of acknowledgement sometimes,\" Sarah says. \nAnd a lack of acknowledgement is something she'd like to address not just for British Asians, but the people working behind the scenes in the music industry too.\nLola Young is up for best pop act at Saturday's Brit Awards and, until 2019, music videos had a chance to be nominated for prizes too.\nThat award, British Video of the Year, no longer exists - it was last won by Little Mix for their Woman Like Me video. \nOther big awards like the Grammys still make a point of celebrating music videos and even go one step further with an award for best recording package, which goes to the artistic director behind a project.\nThis year it was won by Charli XCX and her creative director Imogene Strauss for Brat, which took on a life of its own - even being named Collins Dictionary 2024 word of the year. \n\"That's such a special moment because that campaign and the creative behind it is incredible,\" Sarah says.\nShe'd like to see would like to see similar opportunities for recognition at the Brits. \n\"It would be nice to have that kind of recognition, just because it is such a big production.\n\"There's so many parts to a campaign, it's so multifaceted.\"\nThe Brit Awards have not yet responded to Newsbeat's request for comment.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "Travis Hunter spent the last two years of his college career with Colorado\nShohei Ohtani is known as baseball's \"unicorn\" for his rare ability to play as both an elite hitter and pitcher.\nThe NFL could soon have its own two-way superstar.\nTravis Hunter may be the first overall pick in this year's Draft after being named college football's best player in 2024.\nThe NFL has not had a Draft prospect like him in 27 years, a player who has excelled on both offence and defence.\nHunter is arguably college football's greatest two-way player in history, yet NFL teams are unsure what to do with him.\nBBC Sport looks at why the 21-year-old is so special and the dilemma facing NFL scouts as they prepare for the Draft.\nHunter was the country's top-ranked recruit after playing cornerback and wide receiver at high school in Georgia.\nHe committed to play college football at Jackson State in 2022 so he could play under Deion Sanders, who won two Super Bowls as a two-way player in the 1990s.\nWhen Sanders became Colorado coach in 2023, Hunter followed, and continued to progress on both sides of the ball.\nIn his third and final college season he became the first player to win the awards for best defensive player of the year and best receiver.\nHe also became the first two-way player to win the Heisman Trophy for best player since Charles Woodson (1997), ensuring he will be one of the first players selected at the Draft, which takes place from 24-26 April.\nHunter is not short on confidence or belief, celebrating by striking the Heisman pose several times last season before ultimately clinching the award\nNFL teams got a chance to assess the best of this year's Draft prospects over the weekend at the Scouting Combine.\nAlthough Hunter chose not to take part in any of the drills, he spoke to team officials and the media, making it clear he wants to keep playing full-time on offence and defence.\nLast season he played all 13 of Colorado's games, claiming four interceptions and 96 receptions for 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns. He played 714 (87%) of their offensive snaps and 748 (83%) of their defensive.\nBut few have played both regularly in the NFL. Chuck Bednarik is the last true two-way player, having played centre and linebacker for Philadelphia from 1949-56.\nSince 2006, Patrick Ricard is one of six players to have played 200 offensive and 200 defensive snaps, but the Baltimore full-back has seldom played on defence since 2019.\nWilliam 'the Refrigerator' Perry, Troy Brown, Mike Vrabel and Julian Edelman also played both, but none did both regularly in the same season, as Sanders did with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.\nAfter being drafted, Woodson played almost entirely on defence, and Sanders has told teams not to draft Hunter if they do not plan on giving him the chance to play both.\n\"They say nobody has ever done it the way I do it, but I tell them I'm just different,\" said Hunter.\nIs the NFL Combine sport's weirdest test?\nNFL Combine: \u2018The Super Bowl of scouting events\u2019 on the road to riches\nTravis Hunter is set to showcase his skills at a pro day this month\nHunter says his role in the NFL is \"still up in the air\" and \"up to the organisation\" which drafts him, as each seems to have a different idea of how best to utilise him.\nThe Tennessee Titans have the first pick of the Draft. Last week general manager Mike Borgonzi called Hunter \"special\", while head coach Brian Callahan said he is \"unique\".\nBoth said they see Hunter starting as a cornerback, with Callahan adding: \"Then you find ways to interject him into the offence as he gets more comfortable.\" He even suggested Hunter could also return punts.\nThe Cleveland Browns have the second Draft pick, and general manager Andrew Berry said Hunter is \"a unicorn\" who would play \"receiver primarily first\".\nNew England have the fourth pick, and their executive Eliot Wolf said: \"He's probably going to major in one [position] and minor in the other.\"\nHunter is adamant he wants to do both full-time, adding: \"That's not my job to figure it out.\"\nHunter averaged 111.5 snaps per game with Colorado - 40 more than the highest NFL snap count last season - but he hopes to emulate baseball star Ohtani and show that two-way players can \"become a thing\" in the NFL too.\n\"I do a lot of treatment,\" he said. \"People don't get to see that part - what I do for my body to make sure I'm 100% each game.\n\"I did it at college level, where you rarely get breaks. There are a lot more breaks in the NFL, so I know I can do it.\"\nEnd of a dynasty?

There are a lot more breaks in the NFL, so I know I can do it. \"They say nobody has ever done it the way I do it, but I tell them I'm just different,\" said Hunter.Is the NFL Combine sport's weirdest test?Published23 April 2019NFL Combine: \u2018The Super Bowl of scouting events\u2019 on the road to richesWhere will Hunter play in the NFL?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Travis Hunter is set to showcase his skills at a pro day this monthHunter says his role in the NFL is \"still up in the air\" and \"up to the organisation\" which drafts him, as each seems to have a different idea of how best to utilise him.The Tennessee Titans have the first pick of the Draft. Last week general manager Mike Borgonzi called Hunter \"special\", while head coach Brian Callahan said he is \"unique\".Both said they see Hunter starting as a cornerback, with Callahan adding: \"Then you find ways to interject him into the offence as he gets more comfortable.\" Chuck Bednarik is the last true two-way player, having played centre and linebacker for Philadelphia from 1949-56.Since 2006, Patrick Ricard is one of six players to have played 200 offensive and 200 defensive snaps, but the Baltimore full-back has seldom played on defence since 2019.William 'the Refrigerator' Perry, Troy Brown, Mike Vrabel and Julian Edelman also played both, but none did both regularly in the same season, as Sanders did with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.After being drafted, Woodson played almost entirely on defence, and Sanders has told teams not to draft Hunter if they do not plan on giving him the chance to play both.",

It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar. They are shortlisted for best animated feature for their latest outing, Vengeance Most Fowl.\nRead more about this year's awards season films:",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'It's all boiling over' - Cunha sees red for violent conduct\nAn FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Bournemouth was a disappointing blow for Wolves, but the impact of losing star forward Matheus Cunha for at least three Premier League matches may hurt even more.\nThe 25-year-old had to be dragged down the tunnel and was unable to take part in the penalty shootout following his red card in the final minute of extra time for an unsavoury clash with Cherries defender Milos Kerkez. \nWolves boss Vitor Pereira said: \"Of course, the emotional side was very high and not only inside the pitch, but on the bench and in the stands, a lot of pressure everywhere. In the end it happens.\n\"It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football.\"\nBoth Matt Doherty and Boubacar Traore missed spot-kicks for Wolves in the 5-4 shootout defeat after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes at Vitality Stadium.\nIt was a dramatic climax to a game where Evanilson had put the Cherries ahead on his return from injury, before his fellow Brazilian Cunha levelled with a sensational equaliser from around 30 yards.\nHowever, Cunha's display went from magical to madness with a dismissal that will leave his side - fourth bottom in the Premier League - without their best player for crucial games in their relegation fight.\nThe red-mist moment, where he clashed multiple times with Kerkez, including fighting, kicking out at the Hungarian full-back while he was on the ground and aiming a headbutt when Kerkez had got back to his feet.\nAfter being pulled away by team-mates, referee Sam Barrott eventually gave him a red card but a furious Cunha refused to leave the field, needing to be escorted and pushed down the tunnel. \nHe will be suspended for three games following the red card for violent conduct, but additional games cannot be ruled out because of the severity of the incident and having already served a two-match ban for clashing with Ipswich Town security in December.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Match of the Day: \"The ability he has is top level, the goal he scored belongs in the Champions League, but then suddenly we see the ugly.\n\"I have not seen that on the football pitch since the 1970s - he just lost it. The referee had to send him off. They couldn't get him out of the ground. This was the ugly part and it is something he has to stop.\n\"Wolves need points to stay up. He will be a huge loss.\"\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?\nWolves have what could be described as a favourable run of fixtures coming up against teams in the bottom half of the Premier League. \nBut Cunha is certain to miss matches against Everton, bottom club Southampton and West Ham, while third-bottom Ipswich follow on 5 April.\nWolves have built a five-point buffer over Ipswich and Leicester City after winning two of their past four league matches.\nBut losing talisman Cunha will be a massive blow, given he is their top league scorer on 13 goals and their attacking inspiration in this troubled campaign.\nCunha was sent off in the 120th minute of the match in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vitality Stadium\nCunha has been linked with a big-money move over the past year with Europe's top clubs keen, but he may be viewed as a loose cannon because of his antics.\nAs well as his aggressive display at Bournemouth, in an unsavoury incident at Ipswich earlier in the season, Cunha elbowed a member of the Portman Road staff before snatching his glasses off his face.\nThe Brazil forward is known to have a \u00a362.5m release clause in place which may also put off suitors looking to secure a summer transfer.\nWolves boss Pereira told BBC Match of the Day: \"When the situation happened I was looking for the ball.\n\"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today. Not only inside the pitch, but outside [the pitch]. With a lot of pressure, and in the end these are things that can happen.\n\"You know now he is frustrated, he is better in my opinion. I never speak to the team when we are nervous or frustrated. It is better to wait one day and think about everything. After we can have a talk.\n\"Of course, he is an important player, but next game we play with 11 and start with 11.\"\nSpeaking in his post-match news conference, he added: \"Matheus is a special player and today he played extra time. The last three weeks he has a problem in the hamstring and he tried.\n\"I didn't see the situation. Don't ask me about it because I was looking at the other end. In the end the referee decided the red card.\"\nAsked about whether Cunha deserves another chance, Pereira added: \"Of course, he is important but I cannot speak about what I don't know. It is important to check the situation, to look for what happened because I was looking for the other side.\n\"The others say to me he kick, he punch, he do what he did with the head and the player went to hospital? No, OK. But it is a situation that cannot happen of course.\n\"To judge the situation, I must have the clear image in my mind.\"\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola criticised the decision to show Kerkez a yellow card in the Cunha clash. It was was the defender's second in this season's FA Cup and means he will be banned from playing in the quarter-final tie.\n\"Milos Kerkez has received a yellow card for adopting an aggressive attitude,\" said Iraola. \"After what they have done to Milos Kerkez, they should reward him because [of] the attitude he has.\n\"They punch him, they kick him on the floor, they headbutt him and he doesn't react! You punish this? I will have to say to Milos [that] probably I cannot do as well as a player.\n\"The prize is they show him a yellow card and he will not play the quarter-final.

We lost equipment. It was a disaster,\" Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.\nMpox - formerly known as monkeypox - can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever.\nAccording to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.\nDr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.\nHis health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.\nAt Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.\nFires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.\nThe situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.\nThey were given 72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging \"voluntary returns\".\n\"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to,\" Dr Muhindo said.\nHis fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.\n\"Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions,\" Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDC's mpox incident manager, said on Thursday.\nOver the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory.\nDr Ngongo added that a new variant of mpox with \"high potential for higher transmissibility\" had also been detected in DR Congo.\nThe country's ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congo's army, as well as a lack of funding.\nThe mpox facility at Mugunga, funded by the UN children's agency (Unicef) and UK Aid Direct, managed to reopen last week.\nBut it is already so overstretched that there are times when four or five patients have to share one bed.\n\"I first fled from Minova to Goma when the M23 rebels began to advance from there,\" Sadiki Bichichi Aristide, a 23-year-old being treated at Mugunga along with two of his children, told the BBC.\n\"I began to fall sick in a [camp for displaced people]. It started with my fingers, and then I had lesions, which began to rupture on my hands. My neighbours told me to go to Mugunga with my children. I left my wife behind.\"\nHe said he had seen \"so many\" people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week.\nDr Oummani Rouafi, Unicef's Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters.\nBut this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

It was a disaster,\" Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever.According to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.What is mpox and how is it spread?The children bearing the brunt of the mpox outbreakDr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.They were given 72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging \"voluntary returns\". \"He said he had seen \"so many\" people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week.Dr Oummani Rouafi, Unicef's Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters.But this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said.You may also be interested in:BBC visits mpox clinic as WHO says DR Congo cases 'plateauing'The DR Congo rebel leader whose fighters have created turmoilYour phone, a rare metal and the war in DR CongoGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsAfrica DailyFocus on AfricaMpoxDemocratic Republic of CongoAfrica DR Congo conflict: 500 mpox patients flee clinics after rebel looting9 hours agoShareSaveDorcas WangiraBBC Africa health correspondentShareSaveUnicefStaff at Mugunga health centre in Goma have been unable to trace the 128 patients who fled at the end of JanuaryMore than 500 mpox patients have fled clinics in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo over the last month amid the current conflict.Officials at Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a leading health agency on the continent, have said they are worried as the missing patients risk spreading the highly contagious disease that is suspected to have killed at 900 people in DR Congo last year.The patients fled from facilities in Goma and Bukavu - two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks. \"We were looted.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.\nHis sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.\nA tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. \nIf you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.\nOne of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. \nDuring what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nThe exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nIt escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be \"thankful\" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" \nThe Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.\nIn a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" \n\"He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" Trump said.\nAhead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. \nZelensky had said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. \nNotably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nBut Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.\nTrump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. \nA big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \nOn the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for \"a significant reduction\" in their staff by 13 March.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.\nTrump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter the meeting, Macron said Trump had \"good reason\" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. \nTrump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nPart way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nTrump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.\nThe clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the \"riviera\" of the Middle East.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (\u00a3792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. \nOfficials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.\nTrump unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (\u00a33.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\nThe president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to \"high-level people\".\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. \nIt includes $4.5 trillion (\u00a33.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.\nHowever, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.\nTrump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.\n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.",

        "article_text": "In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.\nTo fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".\n\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"\nTwo years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.\nBut now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.\nCorporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.\nThe moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.\nSince assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\nIn the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.\nAt first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".\nProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.\nUnder names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.\nAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.\nDEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.\nThe programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.\nBut almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".\nMore recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.\nThe roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".\nSocial media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.\nOne of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.\nAnother major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.\nThe ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.\nThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.\nMartin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.\nSurveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".\nMuch rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.\nSome research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.\nThis research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.\nThe problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.\nShe cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.\nBut Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.\nAnd when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.\nWhere studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.\nSupporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.\nLast autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year \u2013 43 \u2013 and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.\nColleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.\nBut the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.\nFor the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.\nBecause of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.\nBut another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.\nDartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.\nIt's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.\nMichelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"\nBut as to the question at the centre of her book \u2013 is DEI dead? \u2013 Jolivet says the answer is no.\nThe companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.\nShe gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"\nBut not everyone is reassured.\nBack in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.\nShe fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".\nShe says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\"\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "summary": "When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.Business under pressureThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.Martin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.Getty ImagesMartin Whittaker, CEO of JUST Capital, says some companies that embraced DEI during the Black Lives Matter movement are now backtracking, having initially acted to \"look good\"But not all are yielding to political and legal pressure.

But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".The making of a backlashProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.Under names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.Getty ImagesDEI programmes surged in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter movement and growing calls for social changeAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.DEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit.",

There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the Netherlands supports Ukraine \"now more than ever\", adding: \"We want a lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression started by Russia. For Ukraine and its people, and for Europe.\"\nGermany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\".\nGermany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the \"unspeakable\" row resembled a \"bad dream\" and \"underlined that a new age of infamy has begun\". \nShe said she would \"wholeheartedly push\" for measures that could help Ukraine \"withstand Russia's aggression even if the US withdraws support, so that it can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation\".\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: \"Ukraine, Spain stands with you,\" while his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk wrote: \"Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.\"\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada \"will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace\".\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted that his country had \"proudly supported the brave people of Ukraine in their struggle to defend their sovereignty against the brutality of Russian aggression and in support of international law\".\nEuropean Union chiefs Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen assured Zelensky in a joint statement that he was \"never alone\".\n\"We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace,\" they said.\nThere were also supportive messages for Ukraine from political leaders in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia.\nHowever, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced his support for Trump, writing: \"Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr President!\"\nOn Saturday, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told the BBC he had spoken with Zelensky twice following the White House meeting.\nHe said he was \"not at liberty to say what was discussed\" but shared that he told Zelensky \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.\nHe said Zelensky must \"find a way\" to restore his relationship with his US counterpart. \nZelensky left the White House early following his row with Trump - but afterwards thanked the US president on social media for his support, saying: \"Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\nWriting on messenger app Telegram on Saturday, Zelensky said it was \"very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after\".\n\"It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world,\" he added.\nIn an interview with Fox News following his White House visit, Zelensky said his row with Trump was \"not good for both sides\" but he thought the relationship could be salvaged.\nThe pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals.\nFriday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\nZelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous 2019 ceasefire deal that was agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for a summit \"without delay\" between the US, Europe and allies on Ukraine.\nSir Keir's crunch talks at Downing Street on Sunday will see European leaders gear up efforts to police a future Ukraine peace deal.\nThe UK prime minister believes a deal will have to involve US military assets providing surveillance, intelligence and potentially warplanes giving air cover to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass. \nWhen asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.\" \nHowever, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.\nIn public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops. \n\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.\nAccording to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.\nPresident Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests. \nHe suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?\nThe short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.\nBritain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending. \nBut Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.\nInstead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.  \nThat force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.\n\nBut these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".\nOfficials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nIt could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.\nWhile Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.\nEuropean nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics. \nNato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough. \nBut the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.\nEurope's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.\nFrance is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.\nSir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.  But as for Donald Trump's question - would  Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no. \n",

Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.\nThere is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.\nSo a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.\nBut this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.\nIt is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.\nIt is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.\nIn addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.\nThe narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".\nPerhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.\nThis strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes. \nThe UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.\nWhile the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.\nThe White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.\nLikewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.\nThis appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.\nThe prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.\nCould the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?\nThere are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.\nAnd even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.\nThat is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.\nThe PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.\nThe strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one.",

        "article_text": "In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.\nTo fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".\n\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"\nTwo years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.\nBut now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.\nCorporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.\nThe moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.\nSince assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\nIn the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.\nAt first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".\nProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.\nUnder names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.\nAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.\nDEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.\nThe programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.\nBut almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".\nMore recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.\nThe roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".\nSocial media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.\nOne of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.\nAnother major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.\nThe ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.\nThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.\nMartin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.\nSurveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".\nMuch rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.\nSome research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.\nThis research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.\nThe problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.\nShe cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.\nBut Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.\nAnd when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.\nWhere studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.\nSupporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.\nLast autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year \u2013 43 \u2013 and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.\nColleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.\nBut the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.\nFor the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.\nBecause of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.\nBut another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.\nDartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.\nIt's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.\nMichelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"\nBut as to the question at the centre of her book \u2013 is DEI dead? \u2013 Jolivet says the answer is no.\nThe companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.\nShe gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"\nBut not everyone is reassured.\nBack in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.\nShe fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".\nShe says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\"\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "summary": "But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.Verstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.That would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.But there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.Verstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.But single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nButtler on 'right time for me' to leave England captaincy\nThe end came quicker than anyone expected.\nJust six months ago England coach Brendon McCullum backed Jos Buttler to the hilt despite questions over his captain's future.\nEven after defeat by Afghanistan, most thought the decision would be made after the flight home. Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "England's men have won only one of their past 11 matches across three formats\nAnd so English cricket limps to its final stop of the winter.\nKarachi, where England will exit the Champions Trophy after Saturday's game against South Africa, is known as the City of Lights. Their last visit, the completion of a 3-0 Test series win in Pakistan in 2022, was Bazball's brightest moment. Now Brendon McCullum and his men cannot shake the dark clouds.\nAdele could write an album about how miserable England's 2025 has been so far. \nThe end of 2024 wasn't much better. The women dropped themselves out of the T20 World Cup and the men were spun out in Pakistan. Heather Knight's side at least won in South Africa and Ben Stokes' men claimed an impressive win in New Zealand, then soured it with a stag-do of a performance in the final Test in Hamilton.\nSince the turn of the year it has been a shambles: the women thrashed all over Australia, the men one win from 10 in McCullum's new white-ball era. Andrew Flintoff's Lions were hammered in South Africa and Australia, and the Under-19 women were well beaten in a World Cup semi-final by India. Thank goodness Archie Vaughan's Under-19 men won their Test series against South Africa.\nIt's probably good to get a few things straight before delving into this: all of us - fans, media and pundits - want England to do well. We care. It hurts when they lose.\nIt is also fair to say I have never met an England player that is not desperate to succeed. They may occasionally forget the England team exists for everyone, not just the individuals in the dressing room, but there is an understandable element of self-preservation at play. Dreams and careers are on the line. Professional sport is cut-throat.\nWe must also be careful to not rewrite history. McCullum was a breath of fresh air to English cricket, both in terms of results and the feeling towards the men's national team. It seemed a no-brainer to put him in charge of the white-ball side, largely because any other coach would have existed in the New Zealander's shadow.\nJon Lewis did similar with the women's team, even if Bazball-lite seemed too simplistic. The draw with Australia in the home Ashes of 2023 was creditable, and probably should have been better given Australia had lost Meg Lanning.\n'McCullum's problems go far beyond Buttler's future'\nEngland need more variety than just 90mph bowlers - Vaughan\nReplacing Buttler the sensible thing to do - Agnew\nAs 2024 wore into 2025 and results became indifferent for both teams, nagging doubts became worries and have now grown into genuine concerns.\nWill Ben Stokes be fully fit again? What has happened to Issy Wong? Why was Josh Hull picked? How did Flintoff go from TV presenter to some of the most high-profile coaching gigs in the country? Why did Dan Lawrence open the batting? Why did Kate Cross captain England in Ireland when it was a golden development opportunity for a youngster? Who signed off on one frontline spinner for a Champions Trophy in Pakistan? What is going on with Shoaib Bashir's bowling? Why do England women drop so many catches? We could go on and on.\nThere are recurring themes across the England national teams. The women have been accused of not being fit enough, the men of not training enough. Both charges are probably unfair, yet the players don't help their public image. \nWe're bored with hearing the men talk about golf and the women were downright daft to be pictured on a boat party during the T20 World Cup in Dubai. These England teams are not lazy, though they can be slapdash.\nThe rhetoric is maddening, too. Many legendary leaders have successfully paired public praise with private criticism, and listening to McCullum in particular can inspire even a jobbing journalist to take on the world. But some of the utterances of the men wind up fans and opposition, while the women were borderline delusional in Australia. Lewis' Bondi to Coogee walk will live in infamy, and the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook are never far from a crass soundbite.\nNone of this matters if England teams are winning. They aren't, which means Rob Key and Clare Connor - directors of cricket of the men's and women's team respectively - have thinking to do.\nIt seems a decent bet that Connor will be looking for a new women's head coach. A review into the Ashes is still taking place and could run until the end of next month. It may be that Knight stays on as captain, partly because she remains an excellent leader and partly because England's succession planning has been awful. Whoever is in charge must get the best out of Sophie Ecclestone on and off the pitch, while a bigger question is whether England have the right structural set-up to consistently compete with the Australians.\nKey's decisions on personnel are probably more straightforward. Jos Buttler sounded like a man ready to make up his own mind on the white-ball captaincy, with Brook most likely to take over. Where it gets trickier for Key, McCullum and the new skipper is reviving the fortunes of the white-ball team in a defining year for the Test side.\nThis video can not be played\nAfghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy\nOn one hand, it is harsh to compare the current white-ball team to the class of 2019, England's greatest team led by their greatest captain Eoin Morgan.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that a white-ball empire has crumbled on Key's watch. It is not his fault domestic 50-over cricket has been marginalised, but the treatment of David Willey, dropping of Sam Curran and Reece Topley, overlooking of Liam Dawson, obsession with pace over skill, lack of death bowlers and left-handed batters all fall at his door. How did England take the field in the Champions Trophy with as many wicketkeepers as frontline bowlers?\nWhereas there was once separation between the Test and white-ball set-ups, greater alignment runs the risk of a malaise from one format bleeding into the other. There is at least a decent break before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.\nUntil then, questions abound. Have England broken Mark Wood in a tournament he probably shouldn't have been playing in? What state is Stokes' hamstring in? Can Bashir become the spinner England need in Australia? Can Zak Crawley reach double figures? Is Test vice-captain Ollie Pope going to be dropped to make way for Jacob Bethell?\nNone of this gloom needs to be terminal. The women's game is about to get a huge boost from the new domestic structure and the men have every chance of winning their five-Test series against India. There is a wealth of young male and female talent coming through and the Ashes next winter has all the ingredients to be a classic.\nFor now, this winter cannot end quickly enough.

        "article_text": "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.\nDespite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.\nSo what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.\nIn Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.\nToday, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.\nKey markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.\nMeanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.\nBut the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.\nStays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"\nWhat's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.\n\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"\nInstead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.\nBut it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.\nA common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.\nThey sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.\nMonika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.\nMore tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.\nAnd, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".\nQuestions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.\nAnd also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.\nBy calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.\nThe Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"\nThe required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.\nSome Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".\nWengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.\nWengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".\nThe resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"\nAmong them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".\nBut most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".\nIn more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.\nAnd, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"\nAnd while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

        "article_text": "\"I grew up round here thinking I could not wait to get out,\" says 51-year-old Dan Davies.\n\"And then I used to come back up from London on a weekly basis and would see half the place boarded up and going downhill fast.\"\nNew Brighton, on the northern tip of the Wirral peninsula in Merseyside, was once a booming holiday destination boasting the longest promenade in the country, a pier and a tower bigger than Blackpool's.\nBut in the mid-1980s, after cheap package deals to Spain had become the first choice for many holidaymakers, New Brighton found itself struggling to keep up, and photographer Martin Parr's famous 1986 collection The Last Resort depicted it as a scruffy, litter-strewn town whose glory days were behind it.\nNow, though, it is undergoing a huge renaissance: in 2020 house prices rose faster in New Brighton than anywhere else in the country, investment is returning and businesses are thriving.\nSo how does a place go from being somewhere people cannot wait to leave to somewhere people cannot move to fast enough?\nFran Barrett, 35, returned to New Brighton after going away to London to study and work as a journalist.\n\"When you're a kid you never want to live where you're growing up,\" she said. \n\"But I realised as I got older why it was such a great place to live.\"\nWhile many of Fran's friends who stayed in London were still trying to get on the property ladder, she and her husband and toddler son were able to move up a rung in 2021 because of the \u00a330,000 they made in profit on their terraced home.\n\"It just has a real community feel to it,\" said Fran. \n\"There are so many new businesses springing up, and if you've got kids there are so many great little parks. \n\"A lot of my friends from other parts of the Wirral are moving here, too.\"\nAnd they all need places to eat, drink and shop. \nFran's sister Lou runs the caf\u00e9 bar and gift shop SUP, just one of many independent businesses that have sprung up in the town in recent years.\nA few hundred yards away from SUP is the James Atherton pub, which takes its name from the resort's founder who, in the 1830s, set about creating a northern version of Sussex seaside town Brighton.\nThe pub made national headlines in 2020 when it was renamed in a disparaging tribute to Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings and their three-tier coronavirus lockdown restrictions.\nIt is one of a number of buildings in Victoria Road that Dan's company Rockpoint Leisure revived.\nTo \"keep out the big boys\", as he puts it, the company bought up parcels of land and buildings and made sure independent shops, cafes and art spaces were able to move in. \nThe walls of many of them are now festooned with large murals by artists both local and global.\n\"We wanted to demonstrate that you don't need big outside consultants to come in and tell you what you need, you need a sustainable plan that can protect a place like New Brighton.\n\"We did that, and we have become the number one model for seaside town regeneration,\" he says.\nVictoria Road is a haven of independent businesses. \nThe Hatch art gallery opened in an old greengrocer's shop and took its name from the hatch through which people were served during the pandemic.\n\"Seaside towns are absolutely having a renaissance,\" says owner Anneley Pickles, 51. \n\"They just need things that will bring people here, whether that's food or entertainment, or workshops or arts spaces.\"\nJust up the road is Tallulah's Emporium, which owner Wayne Saunders describes as a \"listening space\" after the model of the Japanese kissa bars that specialise in playing jazz records.\nWayne, 51, left New Brighton in 1989, at a time when \"numerous friends from primary school had ended up dead or in prison\".\nHe moved to London, where he opened the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Shoreditch, before returning to New Brighton to open up Tallulah's in 2022.\nHe agrees with Dan's assessment that New Brighton is, with its thriving independent scene, \"Wirral's Brooklyn to Liverpool's Manhattan\".\nThere are not many remnants of New Brighton's past as a Victorian and Edwardian seaside town still visible today. \nThe tower was pulled down and sold for scrap in the 1920s, while the ballroom was gutted by fire in 1969 and then demolished.\nBut the town has always remained a seaside resort. \nIn 2011, the Marine Point development opened at an estimated cost of about \u00a365m, bringing a cinema, hotel, bars and restaurants to the seafront. \nIt stands a short distance from the Fort Perch Rock coastal defence battery \u2013 now a museum \u2013 which was built in the 1820s to protect Liverpool from foreign naval attack, and the Adventureland amusement complex which was built about 100 years later and which has been mooted for redevelopment as apartments in recent years.\nJayne Casey, a former member of punk band Big In Japan, now runs a small deli and arts bar District House just around the corner in Victoria Road.\nNow 68, she remembers the New Brighton of the 1980s that was encapsulated in Parr's Last Resort collection, and believes that, generally, the photos captured the area quite well.\n\"It was where people from Liverpool and the Wirral came for a cheap day out,\" she says.\n\"It had a beautiful 1930s outdoor swimming pool, and had that classic seaside town look to it.\n\"It was a place that working-class people came en-masse in the time when the factories closed down for a week and everyone had a week at the seaside.\"\nToday the resort is still popular with day trippers and families. \nAnd according to one person who was involved in its regeneration over the last decade, attempts to broaden what the town had to offer were not always met with open arms.\n\"There was a feeling from some that New Brighton is just about grandparents bringing their grandkids for day out,\" they said. \n\"But there were those who felt it was about more than just Fort Perch Rock and the promenade.\"\nJane, who helped transform a wilderness of empty warehouses near the Liverpool waterfront into the arts and tech enclave now known as the Baltic Triangle, says that while art and culture are playing a big part in New Brighton's renaissance and transformation, the town is not being \"gentrified\".\nGentrification is the process through which working-class urban populations find themselves displaced and priced out of their own communities.\n\"Yes, house prices have gone up and new people have come in but I don't think any kind of mass gentrification has happened,\" she says. \n\"But,\" she warns, \"there are some big sites that could come up and then could become apartment blocks and flats.\"\nNew Brighton's promenade \u2013 the longest in Britain \u2013 will be most familiar to those outside the north-west of England as the location of a Channel 4 ident that includes the TV network's logo running to keep pace with a group of wheelchair racers.\nNext month, the documentary I Am Martin Parr will be screened at The Light cinema, part of the Marine Point complex which looms over the promenade where that clip was filmed and where one of Parr's most infamous shots was taken.\nJose Wilmin, who has been coming to New Brighton for more than 60 years from her home in Ellesmere Port, has witnessed the resort going through its ups and downs in that time.\n\"It used to be a proper holiday place, there was a massive outdoor pool, a big funfair and the main street was just packed with bucket-and-spade shops,\" the 68-year-old says.\nWhile she says it is great to see New Brighton \"on the up again\", she has been a regular through good times and bad.\n\"I've always come here, to have fish and chips and watch the world go by.\n\"It's where I used to come with my mum. It's where all my memories were made.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

        "article_text": "I was effectively homeless after getting sacked - Stoney\nCasey Stoney was only meant to be returning to England temporarily last June for a funeral when she found herself stuck in the country, along with her family, unable to go back to their home in California.\nUpon landing on British soil, the former England captain was informed by her agent that she had been sacked as head coach of NWSL club San Diego Wave.\n\"When I got fired, it terminated our visas with immediate effect whilst I was in the UK, pretty much rendering me and my partner homeless, with three children,\" she tells BBC Sport.\nAs she had been outside of the US when her sacking happened and her visa was dependent on her work, she had no way of returning without finding another sponsor.\nThat led to a turbulent few months for the 42-year-old, who was left questioning whether she even wanted to keep working in football.\nNow the former Manchester United boss is taking on international management for the first time in her new role as Canada coach, and is finally back to doing what she loves - getting out on the training pitch and working with her players.\nFormer England defender Casey Stoney (right) joined newly formed club San Diego Wave in June 2021\nStoney, who won 130 caps for England and captained Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, had been in charge of San Diego Wave for nearly three years after resigning as Manchester United manager in 2021.\nThe NWSL club were a new franchise when she became head coach and she led them to third place and then top spot during the first two seasons.\nThey twice reached the semi-finals of the end-of-season play-offs, which crowns the league's champions, but her third season had not continued on the same trajectory with just three wins after 14 games.\nShe saw the job as a long-term project. She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California.\n\"It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren't even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,\" she says.\n\"If I'm honest, I didn't think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn't even anything major.\n\"So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family.\n\"I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn't have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family.\"\nThe day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself.\nIt was a period she describes as \"one of the hardest times in my life\".\nShe says: \"It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game.\n\"I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out.\n\"My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego.\"\nCasey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018\nIt took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney's consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and \"our lives\". They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim.\n\"[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time.\"\nShe also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities.\n\"It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn't have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds.\"\nThe ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women's Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time.\nBut then along came the Canada job.\nAt first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she \"loves\", which is working with players day to day.\nYet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months.\n\"I really liked that it was extensive,\" she says. \"It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me.\"\nThat included speaking to the manager of the men's team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game.\nAnd she was impressed \u2013 by the organisation's leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role.\n\"When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn't have to move,\" she said.\n\"That's been really, really beneficial for us as a family. I don't think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you're in a privileged position, but it's the impact on your family it has.\n\"I had young children that just didn't understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I'd contributed to that, which was difficult.\n\"There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn't have a job. There were some I would have been interested in, some I wouldn't have been interested in, but as soon as I got involved in this process it became clear I was really interested in this [and] I was only committed to one thing.\"\nCasey Stoney took charge of Canada for the first time in February, overseeing two wins and one draw in the Pinatar Cup in Spain\nShe is taking over a country who are ranked sixth in the world but have experienced their own turmoil.\nDuring last summer's Paris Olympics, in which Canada reached the quarter-finals, two members of the team's coaching staff were sent home for flying a drone over a training session held by New Zealand, their opponents in a group game.\nTheir head coach Bev Priestman, another Englishwoman, was given a year-long ban by world governing body Fifa and Canada - who had won Olympic gold at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games - were docked six points.\nPriestman \"did reach out and wish me luck\" says Stoney, but they have had no other communication and the new Canada coach is keen to focus on the future, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon.\nShe met the majority of her players for the first time over the last two weeks as Canada competed in a four-team tournament, the Pinatar Cup, in Spain, which they won following a 7-0 thrashing of Chinese Taipei, a 2-0 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with China.\n\"This team excites me,\" she says. \"I do think they've got so much potential.\n\"What they were able to achieve last year in difficult circumstances shows what they're capable of, but there's so much more to come.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "England's men have won only one of their past 11 matches across three formats\nAnd so English cricket limps to its final stop of the winter.\nKarachi, where England will exit the Champions Trophy after Saturday's game against South Africa, is known as the City of Lights. Their last visit, the completion of a 3-0 Test series win in Pakistan in 2022, was Bazball's brightest moment. Now Brendon McCullum and his men cannot shake the dark clouds.\nAdele could write an album about how miserable England's 2025 has been so far. \nThe end of 2024 wasn't much better. The women dropped themselves out of the T20 World Cup and the men were spun out in Pakistan. Heather Knight's side at least won in South Africa and Ben Stokes' men claimed an impressive win in New Zealand, then soured it with a stag-do of a performance in the final Test in Hamilton.\nSince the turn of the year it has been a shambles: the women thrashed all over Australia, the men one win from 10 in McCullum's new white-ball era. Andrew Flintoff's Lions were hammered in South Africa and Australia, and the Under-19 women were well beaten in a World Cup semi-final by India. Thank goodness Archie Vaughan's Under-19 men won their Test series against South Africa.\nIt's probably good to get a few things straight before delving into this: all of us - fans, media and pundits - want England to do well. We care. It hurts when they lose.\nIt is also fair to say I have never met an England player that is not desperate to succeed. They may occasionally forget the England team exists for everyone, not just the individuals in the dressing room, but there is an understandable element of self-preservation at play. Dreams and careers are on the line. Professional sport is cut-throat.\nWe must also be careful to not rewrite history. McCullum was a breath of fresh air to English cricket, both in terms of results and the feeling towards the men's national team. It seemed a no-brainer to put him in charge of the white-ball side, largely because any other coach would have existed in the New Zealander's shadow.\nJon Lewis did similar with the women's team, even if Bazball-lite seemed too simplistic. The draw with Australia in the home Ashes of 2023 was creditable, and probably should have been better given Australia had lost Meg Lanning.\n'McCullum's problems go far beyond Buttler's future'\nEngland need more variety than just 90mph bowlers - Vaughan\nReplacing Buttler the sensible thing to do - Agnew\nAs 2024 wore into 2025 and results became indifferent for both teams, nagging doubts became worries and have now grown into genuine concerns.\nWill Ben Stokes be fully fit again? What has happened to Issy Wong? Why was Josh Hull picked? How did Flintoff go from TV presenter to some of the most high-profile coaching gigs in the country? Why did Dan Lawrence open the batting? Why did Kate Cross captain England in Ireland when it was a golden development opportunity for a youngster? Who signed off on one frontline spinner for a Champions Trophy in Pakistan? What is going on with Shoaib Bashir's bowling? Why do England women drop so many catches? We could go on and on.\nThere are recurring themes across the England national teams. The women have been accused of not being fit enough, the men of not training enough. Both charges are probably unfair, yet the players don't help their public image. \nWe're bored with hearing the men talk about golf and the women were downright daft to be pictured on a boat party during the T20 World Cup in Dubai. These England teams are not lazy, though they can be slapdash.\nThe rhetoric is maddening, too. Many legendary leaders have successfully paired public praise with private criticism, and listening to McCullum in particular can inspire even a jobbing journalist to take on the world. But some of the utterances of the men wind up fans and opposition, while the women were borderline delusional in Australia. Lewis' Bondi to Coogee walk will live in infamy, and the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook are never far from a crass soundbite.\nNone of this matters if England teams are winning. They aren't, which means Rob Key and Clare Connor - directors of cricket of the men's and women's team respectively - have thinking to do.\nIt seems a decent bet that Connor will be looking for a new women's head coach. A review into the Ashes is still taking place and could run until the end of next month. It may be that Knight stays on as captain, partly because she remains an excellent leader and partly because England's succession planning has been awful. Whoever is in charge must get the best out of Sophie Ecclestone on and off the pitch, while a bigger question is whether England have the right structural set-up to consistently compete with the Australians.\nKey's decisions on personnel are probably more straightforward. Jos Buttler sounded like a man ready to make up his own mind on the white-ball captaincy, with Brook most likely to take over. Where it gets trickier for Key, McCullum and the new skipper is reviving the fortunes of the white-ball team in a defining year for the Test side.\nThis video can not be played\nAfghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy\nOn one hand, it is harsh to compare the current white-ball team to the class of 2019, England's greatest team led by their greatest captain Eoin Morgan.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that a white-ball empire has crumbled on Key's watch. It is not his fault domestic 50-over cricket has been marginalised, but the treatment of David Willey, dropping of Sam Curran and Reece Topley, overlooking of Liam Dawson, obsession with pace over skill, lack of death bowlers and left-handed batters all fall at his door. How did England take the field in the Champions Trophy with as many wicketkeepers as frontline bowlers?\nWhereas there was once separation between the Test and white-ball set-ups, greater alignment runs the risk of a malaise from one format bleeding into the other. There is at least a decent break before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.\nUntil then, questions abound. Have England broken Mark Wood in a tournament he probably shouldn't have been playing in? What state is Stokes' hamstring in? Can Bashir become the spinner England need in Australia? Can Zak Crawley reach double figures? Is Test vice-captain Ollie Pope going to be dropped to make way for Jacob Bethell?\nNone of this gloom needs to be terminal. The women's game is about to get a huge boost from the new domestic structure and the men have every chance of winning their five-Test series against India. There is a wealth of young male and female talent coming through and the Ashes next winter has all the ingredients to be a classic.\nFor now, this winter cannot end quickly enough. Last rites and alarm bells will not be drowned out by good vibes.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "TikTok is profiting from sexual livestreams performed by teens as young as 15,  the BBC has been told.\nWe spoke to three women in Kenya who said they began this activity as teenagers. They told us they used TikTok to openly advertise and negotiate payment for more explicit content that would be sent via other messaging platforms.\nTikTok bans solicitation but the company knows it takes place, moderators have told the BBC. TikTok takes a cut of about 70% from all livestream transactions, we have previously found.\nTikTok told the BBC it has \"zero tolerance for exploitation\".\nLivestreams from Kenya are popular on TikTok - each night over the course of a week, we found up to a dozen in which women performers danced suggestively, watched by hundreds of people around the world.\nWarning: Contains details of a sexual nature\nIt's two o'clock in the morning in Nairobi, and the TikTok Lives are in full flow.\nMusic blasts, and\u202fusers chat over each other, as a woman turns her camera on to twerk or pose provocatively. Emoji \"gifts\" then fill the screen.\n\"Inbox me for kinembe guys. Tap, tap,\" the performers say on repeat. \"Tap, tap,\" is a phrase commonly used on TikTok, calling for viewers to \"like\" a  livestream.\n\"Kinembe\" is Swahili for \"clitoris\". \"Inbox me\" instructs the viewer to send a private message over TikTok with a more explicit bespoke request - such as to watch the performer masturbating, stripping or performing sexual activities with other women.\nIn some of the livestreams we watched, coded sexual slang was used to advertise sexual services.\nThe emoji gifts act as payment for the TikTok livestreams and - because TikTok removes any obvious sexual acts and nudity - also the more explicit content sent later on other platforms. The gifts can be converted into cash.\n\"It's not in TikTok's interest to clamp down on soliciting of sex - the more people give gifts on a livestream\u2026 [the] more revenue for TikTok,\" says a Kenyan former moderator we are calling Jo - one of more than 40,000 moderators TikTok says it employs globally.\nWe discovered that TikTok is still taking about a 70% cut from livestream gifts. The company denied it took such a large commission after we established the same cut in a 2022 investigation.\nTikTok has long been aware of child exploitation in its livestreams - having run its own internal investigation in 2022 - but ignored the issue because it \"profited significantly\" from them, according to the claims of a lawsuit brought by the US state of Utah last year.\nTikTok responded that the lawsuit - which is ongoing - ignored the \"proactive measures\" it had made to improve safety.\nKenya is a hotspot for this abuse, says the charity ChildFund Kenya, compounded by a young demographic and widespread internet usage. The African continent as a whole also has poor online moderation compared to Western countries, the charity added.\nJo, who worked for Teleperformance - contracted by TikTok to provide content moderation - says moderators are given a reference guide of banned sexual words or actions. But this guide is restrictive, says Jo, and does not take into account slang or other provocative gestures.\n\"You can see by the way they are posing, with the camera on their cleavage and thighs [for example], that they are soliciting sex. They may not say anything, but you can see they are signposting to their [other platform] account, but there's nothing I can do.\"\nAnother content moderator for Teleperformance, who we are calling Kelvin, says moderation is also limited by TikTok's increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), which he says is not sensitive enough to pick up on local sexual slang.\nJo and Kelvin are among seven current and former content moderators working on TikTok content who told us their concerns. Jo says about 80% of livestreams flagged in content moderators' feeds were sexual, or advertising sexual services, and TikTok is aware of the scale of the issue.\nChildFund Kenya and other charities have told the BBC that children as young as nine are taking part in these activities.\nWe have spoken to teenage girls and young women who say they are spending up to six or seven hours a night on the activity and making on average \u00a330 a day - enough to pay for a week's food and transport.\n\"I sell myself on TikTok. I dance naked. I do that because that's where I can earn money to support myself,\" says a 17-year-old we are calling Esther. She lives in a poor Nairobi neighbourhood, where 3,000 residents share toilet facilities. She says the money helps her buy food for her child, and support her mother who has been struggling to pay the rent since Esther's father died.\nShe says she was 15 years old when she was introduced to TikTok Lives by a friend, who helped her bypass the age restrictions - only over-18s can use a Live. Users also need at least 1,000 followers to go live. \nSo TikTok users with a big following can act as digital pimps - hosting the livestreams selling sexual content. Some of them have back-up accounts, indicating they have been banned or suspended by TikTok in the past.\nThey appear to know how to evade detection by TikTok's content moderators, while generating the right amount of sexual teasing to pique customers' interest.\n\"When you're dancing, move away from the camera, otherwise you'll get blocked,\" shouts a pimp to a woman twerking on screen.\nIn return for being hosted, the women give pimps a cut of their earnings.\nThe relationship can quickly turn exploitative, says Esther. She says her digital pimp knew she was under 18, and \"he likes using young girls\".\nHe put pressure on her to earn more - meaning she needed to livestream more frequently - and took a larger cut of her earnings than she expected, she says.\n\"So if an emoji is sent which is 35,000ksh (\u00a3213), he takes 20,000ksh (\u00a3121) and you only get 15,000ksh (\u00a391).\"\nWorking for him was like being in \"handcuffs\" she says.\u202f\"You are the one hurting because he gets the biggest share and yet it is you who has been used.\"\n\"Sophie\", not her real name, who says she was also 15 when she started livestreaming on TikTok, says she got requests from men in Europe for services on third-party platforms, including from one a German user who would demand that she caress her breasts and genitals for money.\nNow 18, she regrets her online sex work. Some of the videos she sent to users via other platforms were then uploaded to social media without her consent, she says.\nHer neighbours found out, and warned other young people not to associate with her, she told the BBC.\n\"They brand me as a lost sheep, and young people are told that I'll mislead them. I am lonely most of the time.\"\nSome of the girls and women we spoke to said they had also been paid to meet TikTok users for sex in person, or had been pressured into having sex with their pimps.\nTikTok is keen to establish itself in African markets, but is not employing enough staff to effectively monitor content, the content moderators in Kenya told us.\nKenya's government has shown signs of acknowledging the issue - in 2023, President William Ruto held a meeting with TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew to call for better content moderation on the platform. The government said the company had agreed to tighter regulation, with a TikTok office in Kenya to help co-ordinate operations.\nBut the moderators we spoke to said, more than 18 months later, neither had happened.\nTeleperformance replied that its moderators  \"work diligently to tag and flag user-generated content based on community standards and client guidelines\" and that its clients' systems are not set up to allow Teleperformance to remove offending material or report it to law enforcement authorities.\nA spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC:\n\"TikTok has zero tolerance for exploitation. We enforce strict safety policies, including robust Live content rules, moderation in 70 languages, including Swahili, and we partner with local experts and creators, including our Sub-Saharan Africa Safety Advisory Council to continually strengthen our approach.\"",

        "article_text": "Was it pruning or felling? \nThe alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.\nThe chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.\nThe trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.\nBut rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. \n\"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,\" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.\nThe project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000\u20137,000 still left to be mapped.\nDespite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.\nThis is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.\nBut on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.\nThe trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.\nThe Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected \"pleasure gardens\" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. \nThe chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.\nAccording to government literature,  in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. \nEmperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.\nInterestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.   \nBut environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.\n\"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,\" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.\n\"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,\" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.\nChinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.\nGovernment projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.\nLast week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.\n\"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,\" Mr Bhat says. \n\"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.\"",

        "article_text": "\"I grew up round here thinking I could not wait to get out,\" says 51-year-old Dan Davies.\n\"And then I used to come back up from London on a weekly basis and would see half the place boarded up and going downhill fast.\"\nNew Brighton, on the northern tip of the Wirral peninsula in Merseyside, was once a booming holiday destination boasting the longest promenade in the country, a pier and a tower bigger than Blackpool's.\nBut in the mid-1980s, after cheap package deals to Spain had become the first choice for many holidaymakers, New Brighton found itself struggling to keep up, and photographer Martin Parr's famous 1986 collection The Last Resort depicted it as a scruffy, litter-strewn town whose glory days were behind it.\nNow, though, it is undergoing a huge renaissance: in 2020 house prices rose faster in New Brighton than anywhere else in the country, investment is returning and businesses are thriving.\nSo how does a place go from being somewhere people cannot wait to leave to somewhere people cannot move to fast enough?\nFran Barrett, 35, returned to New Brighton after going away to London to study and work as a journalist.\n\"When you're a kid you never want to live where you're growing up,\" she said. \n\"But I realised as I got older why it was such a great place to live.\"\nWhile many of Fran's friends who stayed in London were still trying to get on the property ladder, she and her husband and toddler son were able to move up a rung in 2021 because of the \u00a330,000 they made in profit on their terraced home.\n\"It just has a real community feel to it,\" said Fran. \n\"There are so many new businesses springing up, and if you've got kids there are so many great little parks. \n\"A lot of my friends from other parts of the Wirral are moving here, too.\"\nAnd they all need places to eat, drink and shop. \nFran's sister Lou runs the caf\u00e9 bar and gift shop SUP, just one of many independent businesses that have sprung up in the town in recent years.\nA few hundred yards away from SUP is the James Atherton pub, which takes its name from the resort's founder who, in the 1830s, set about creating a northern version of Sussex seaside town Brighton.\nThe pub made national headlines in 2020 when it was renamed in a disparaging tribute to Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings and their three-tier coronavirus lockdown restrictions.\nIt is one of a number of buildings in Victoria Road that Dan's company Rockpoint Leisure revived.\nTo \"keep out the big boys\", as he puts it, the company bought up parcels of land and buildings and made sure independent shops, cafes and art spaces were able to move in. \nThe walls of many of them are now festooned with large murals by artists both local and global.\n\"We wanted to demonstrate that you don't need big outside consultants to come in and tell you what you need, you need a sustainable plan that can protect a place like New Brighton.\n\"We did that, and we have become the number one model for seaside town regeneration,\" he says.\nVictoria Road is a haven of independent businesses. \nThe Hatch art gallery opened in an old greengrocer's shop and took its name from the hatch through which people were served during the pandemic.\n\"Seaside towns are absolutely having a renaissance,\" says owner Anneley Pickles, 51. \n\"They just need things that will bring people here, whether that's food or entertainment, or workshops or arts spaces.\"\nJust up the road is Tallulah's Emporium, which owner Wayne Saunders describes as a \"listening space\" after the model of the Japanese kissa bars that specialise in playing jazz records.\nWayne, 51, left New Brighton in 1989, at a time when \"numerous friends from primary school had ended up dead or in prison\".\nHe moved to London, where he opened the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Shoreditch, before returning to New Brighton to open up Tallulah's in 2022.\nHe agrees with Dan's assessment that New Brighton is, with its thriving independent scene, \"Wirral's Brooklyn to Liverpool's Manhattan\".\nThere are not many remnants of New Brighton's past as a Victorian and Edwardian seaside town still visible today. \nThe tower was pulled down and sold for scrap in the 1920s, while the ballroom was gutted by fire in 1969 and then demolished.\nBut the town has always remained a seaside resort. \nIn 2011, the Marine Point development opened at an estimated cost of about \u00a365m, bringing a cinema, hotel, bars and restaurants to the seafront. \nIt stands a short distance from the Fort Perch Rock coastal defence battery \u2013 now a museum \u2013 which was built in the 1820s to protect Liverpool from foreign naval attack, and the Adventureland amusement complex which was built about 100 years later and which has been mooted for redevelopment as apartments in recent years.\nJayne Casey, a former member of punk band Big In Japan, now runs a small deli and arts bar District House just around the corner in Victoria Road.\nNow 68, she remembers the New Brighton of the 1980s that was encapsulated in Parr's Last Resort collection, and believes that, generally, the photos captured the area quite well.\n\"It was where people from Liverpool and the Wirral came for a cheap day out,\" she says.\n\"It had a beautiful 1930s outdoor swimming pool, and had that classic seaside town look to it.\n\"It was a place that working-class people came en-masse in the time when the factories closed down for a week and everyone had a week at the seaside.\"\nToday the resort is still popular with day trippers and families. \nAnd according to one person who was involved in its regeneration over the last decade, attempts to broaden what the town had to offer were not always met with open arms.\n\"There was a feeling from some that New Brighton is just about grandparents bringing their grandkids for day out,\" they said. \n\"But there were those who felt it was about more than just Fort Perch Rock and the promenade.\"\nJane, who helped transform a wilderness of empty warehouses near the Liverpool waterfront into the arts and tech enclave now known as the Baltic Triangle, says that while art and culture are playing a big part in New Brighton's renaissance and transformation, the town is not being \"gentrified\".\nGentrification is the process through which working-class urban populations find themselves displaced and priced out of their own communities.\n\"Yes, house prices have gone up and new people have come in but I don't think any kind of mass gentrification has happened,\" she says. \n\"But,\" she warns, \"there are some big sites that could come up and then could become apartment blocks and flats.\"\nNew Brighton's promenade \u2013 the longest in Britain \u2013 will be most familiar to those outside the north-west of England as the location of a Channel 4 ident that includes the TV network's logo running to keep pace with a group of wheelchair racers.\nNext month, the documentary I Am Martin Parr will be screened at The Light cinema, part of the Marine Point complex which looms over the promenade where that clip was filmed and where one of Parr's most infamous shots was taken.\nJose Wilmin, who has been coming to New Brighton for more than 60 years from her home in Ellesmere Port, has witnessed the resort going through its ups and downs in that time.\n\"It used to be a proper holiday place, there was a massive outdoor pool, a big funfair and the main street was just packed with bucket-and-spade shops,\" the 68-year-old says.\nWhile she says it is great to see New Brighton \"on the up again\", she has been a regular through good times and bad.\n\"I've always come here, to have fish and chips and watch the world go by.\n\"It's where I used to come with my mum. It's where all my memories were made.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

This happened to a Cambridge University academic - but how has being in the spotlight affected her?\nA photo of Dr Ally Louks and her completed PhD thesis, posted to X in November 2024, attracted viral fame when it was viewed more than 120 million times - and the numbers have risen steadily since then.\nAmong the congratulations and interest in her subject - \"the politics of smell\" - were many disturbing comments, mysogynistic, accusatory and personally threatening.\nReflecting on the experience three months on, she says: \"This has undoubtedly changed my life... and while I would not wish this on anyone, it has given me a platform to speak positively about academia and research.\"\nDr Louks, a supervisor in English Literature at the university, is a self-confessed introvert and rarely used social media before posting her photo - which was mainly intended for her friends - on X.\nHer subject - \"Olfactory Ethics: The politics of smell in modern and contemporary prose\" - explored \"why certain writers of the past century use the language associated with smell to characterise harmful attitudes towards objects of disgust and desire\".\n\"I draw on the well-documented history of olfactory prejudice in order to examine its contemporary relevance,\" she says.\nFor example, her work looked at Hitler's claims about the smell of Jewish people in his book Mein Kampf, and how descriptions of the transatlantic slave trade were also used \"to legitimize racism\".\nHer seemingly innocent post attracted a number of abusive comments from people who believed women should stay out of academia and those who did not understand her work, and were \"under-informed or indeed uninformed\", as she puts it.\nThe comments included threats of rape and death.\nWithin about 36 hours of her post, the haters got on board.\n\"It was pretty all-consuming for the first week,\" she says. \n\"Replies were coming in far faster than I could read them, so I wasn't sleeping much in an attempt to keep up with the conversation. \n\"I won't pretend that it was pleasant to have people saying unkind things, but the critiques were ultimately quite baseless as they were based on the title and abstract of my thesis alone or were downright misogynistic. \n\"It never caused me to question the value or validity of my work. I tried to approach the situation with openness and intellectual curiosity, because there was some valid scepticism, and I've relished the opportunity to prove the worth of my work among the public audience that I've been gifted.\"\nDr Louks says she tried to approach the attention - both good and bad - in a positive way - and would advise anyone else to do the same.\n\"The positive comments I received significantly outweighed the negatives, but the negative ones were liked and shared which boosted them to the top of my feed.\n\"I refused to engage with anyone who was aggressive or insulting but I did respond to some people who were sceptical or just didn't understand my work. I was perfectly happy to prove the validity of it.\n\"I don't engage so there's no point in the negative posters carrying on.\n\"My story shows that it's possible to remain both open to criticism and respectful of others online whilst also defending what matters, which is the value and validity of research in the humanities and the legitimacy of women's role in academia.\"\n\"Initially I was very shaken up when the hateful comments starting coming in,\" she says.\n\"I'm an introvert and I never asked for this - and while some people say they are even jealous of this social media 'fame', I wouldn't wish this on anyone.\n\"But it has given me a platform to talk about the importance of academia so for me, personally, it's undoubtedly been a good thing.\"\nDr Louks now has been assigned both a British and American literary agent.\n\"It doesn't go over my head that the reason that I have all of these opportunities is because people responded to my work with such scepticism initially,\" she previously told the BBC.\nDr Louks says she received - and continues to receive - support from both her college and the university as a whole, which she describes as \"really heartening\".\n\"This experience has undoubtedly changed my life... but in many ways this experience hasn't changed me. \n\"I think a lot of people want this kind of attention, but I have never harboured a desire to become famous. \n\"What I am passionate about doing is sharing my research, sparking conversations about important social phenomena, and translating academic work for public audiences, and this experience has given me a platform to do that and to perhaps turn that into a career.\"\nFor someone who used to shy away from social media, she admits that \"all of the things I post get a lot of attention now because I have gained a large following. \n\"But the attention has been overwhelmingly positive since that initial post. \n\"I do think very carefully about what I say online now, and as a generally offline person, it has been a real learning experience, but I think you typically can't go too wrong if you remain open to feedback and approach discussions with generosity and a willingness to listen.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

Their opponents, Brighton, are fifth and have not won in their past six league games.\nHowever, Brighton put up a good showing when these sides met earlier in the season and are bolstered by the return of former Chelsea forward Fran Kirby from injury.\n\"We'll go in with belief,\" said England international Kirby. \"The last game against Chelsea was probably one of the best performances of the season. Hopefully we can learn from that game. It's going to be a case of every player doing their job - and a half.\"\nLiverpool sacked manager Matt Beard after only winning four WSL games this season, while Laura Kaminski oversaw one victory in the league with Crystal Palace\nLiverpool and Crystal Palace go head to head on Sunday as the clubs begin new phases in the season after sacking Matt Beard and Laura Kaminski this week.\nLiverpool dismissed manager Beard on Thursday, with the Reds seventh in the WSL table, while bottom-of-the-league Palace announced Kaminski's exit on Friday.\nAmber Whiteley has taken interim charge of the Reds, with a search for a new manager already under way.\nWhiteley said in Friday's pre-match news conference she wants the job on a permanent basis.\n\"I will put my name in the hat, but let's get Palace out of the way first and I can think a bit longer term after that,\" she said.\n\"I am in a far better position having had the time with Matt and working under him. I'm so grateful to Matt for everything that he has given to me personally over the last three and a bit years. I'm going to miss him.\"\nPalace, who have only won one league match and collected six league points all season, said they \"will provide an update on Laura's replacement in due course\".\nManchester City are 12 points behind leaders Chelsea\nThe international break has given teams a break from regular football, but when Manchester City play Tottenham on Sunday it marks the beginning of a gruelling run of eight games in 29 days for Gareth Taylor's City side.\nThey have to contest the League Cup final, both legs of their Women's Champions League quarter-final and a league game against Chelsea, an FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, and other league games against West Ham and Brighton.\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, that manager Taylor says it will be \"really tough\" for his side to get the results they want in March.\n\"There's a lot going on in this month and I think the conversation will certainly be 'attack the next game, don't try and give too much thought to what's further down the road',\" Taylor said.\nThe situation is made even more difficult by the number of injuries in the squad \u2013 including a fresh hamstring issue for Rebecca Knaak \u2013 and players having departed.\nLaura Coombs, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood potentially completing their recoveries from injury could help, but that won't stop it being a tricky few weeks.\nRenee Slegers has not given up on Arsenal's title ambitions\nChelsea have pulled seven points clear at the top, but it remains tight between the teams who are battling for a spot in Europe.\nThe top three qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United are second with 33 points, Arsenal have 30 and Manchester City have 28.\nArsenal boss Renee Slegers has not given up of trying to pip Chelsea to the title.\n\"We need to believe that, and I do,\" she said.\n\"We have a very exciting block, full of opportunities ahead of us, and we're going to try and take those opportunities, and that's within our control.\"\nManchester United manager Marc Skinner also remains optimistic, believing that his side can go on to do \"magnificent things\".\n\"The reality is we have been going about our business under scrutiny for many years and probably forever will do. We have learned to get on with our job,\" Skinner said.\n\"There will be good times, there will be bad times. If you treat both of them the same you will be in a balanced position. If we are balanced we are a very good team that can go and do magnificent things.\"\nManchester United beat Leicester 2-0 at King Power Stadium in November\nLeicester gained only their third win of the WSL season on 16 February with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa to move up to 10th, six points clear of bottom-placed Crystal Palace.\nBut the Foxes' task could not be any tougher in the coming days, as they meet both the top two away from home in the space of four days.\nThey play on Sunday away against a Manchester United side who have won six WSL games in a row. After that, Amandine Miquel's Leicester travel to runaway leaders Chelsea, although the Foxes are the only side to take points off the Blues this season, drawing 1-1 in December.\n\"The team is ready, they are fighting,\" said Miquel on Thursday. \"We have two games so close so it will be an occasion for most of the players to play. We play opponents of good quality so we will make rotations to be able to have the best teams that we can put on the pitch.\n\"We want to go to every game like we can win. If we don't feel like that, we might as well not go and stay here. We're going to go for both games to do our best to see if we can get a point or two.\"",

        "article_text": "Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.\nFor those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.\n\"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,\" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.\n\"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live.\"\nYulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.\nBefore the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.\nBefore Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.\n\"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,\" says 30-year-old Andriy. \"They don't respect the people of Ukraine.\"\n\"It looks like Washington supports Russia!\" observes Dmytro, 26.\nYou wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.\n\"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,\" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.\nWorld leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.\nHis ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.\nBut Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.\nNot least with his warming to Russia.\nThe initial reaction was that of shock,\" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.\n\"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,\" she adds. \"It's painful.\"\nUkrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.\nPerhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.\n\"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,\" argues Sovsun.\nThere are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.\n\"It's important to find the right mediator,\" she says. \"Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.\n\"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy.\"\nPresident Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.\n\"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,\" she adds. \"Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war.\"\nWhat the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.\n\"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,\" she says.\nWhile there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.\nHer European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.\nHe was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as \"threats to national security\" and \"creating obstacles to economic development\". Mr Poroshenko said it was \"politically motivated\".\nDespite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.\nAs sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.\nRussia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.\n\"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,\" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.\nAfter Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,\" he says.\nAs he ruthlessly pursues his \"America First\" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.\n\"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,\" says Mr Chmut.\n\"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Svitlana Libet.",

I don't know how long it will take.

But, from personal experience, he knows talking about a team and managing one is two entirely different things.\n\"That (winning the Premier League) is the goal,\" said Amorim. \"To be naive is to think we are going to do it this season or be the best contender next season.\n\"I know in this moment, everybody knows everything.

She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

They were also ordered to pay NZ$4.8m in reparation to the victims. \nHowever, following an appeal, the High Court ruled on Friday that the company only owned the land and were not responsible for people's safety.\nWhite Island, which is also known by its M\u0101ori name, Whakaari, is New Zealand's most active volcano and has been erupting in some form since 2011.\nIt had been showing signs of heightened unrest for weeks before the fatal December 2019 eruption, which killed almost half of the people who were on it at the time. Most were tourists, including 17 from Australia and three from the US.\nAnother 25 people were injured, with many suffering extensive burns.\nHigh Court Justice Simon Moore said on Friday that while WML licensed tours of the volcano, there was nothing in these agreements that gave the company control of what was happening on the island day to day.\nHe agreed that it was reasonable for the company to rely on tour operators, as well as emergency management and science organisations, to assess risks to safety.\nJustice Moore added that, in coming to his decision, he had not ignored the pain and grief of the families that had been affected.\n\"It is impossible not to be deeply moved and affected by the sheer scale and nature of the human loss in this case,\" he said.\nThirteen parties in total, including tour operators, were charged over the disaster. WML was the last to receive a verdict after six had pleaded guilty, while six more had their charges dismissed.\nThe case against WML was the largest action of its kind brought by New Zealand's regulator, Worksafe NZ, who said it acknowledged the High Court ruling and was considering whether to appeal. \nJames Cairney, a lawyer for James, Andrew and Peter Buttle - three brothers who own the company - said the family welcomed the decision, Radio New Zealand reported. He added that the Buttles hoped it would \"bring certainty for all landowners who grant others recreational access to their land\". \nThe Buttle family has owned Whakaari/White Island since the 1930s, when their grandfather bought it and placed it in a family trust. It is one of only a few privately owned islands in New Zealand. \nThe brothers had previously been on trial in relation to the 2019 disaster as individuals over alleged breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety legislation.

        "article_text": "From Disney's Snow White to Mickey 17, these are the films to stream at home and watch in the cinema this month.\nDisney's Snow White is a live-action/ CGI remake of Walt Disney's first ever feature-length cartoon, 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but it's proven to be more controversial than the studio's other remakes. Some bigoted social-media posters objected to the casting of Rachel Zegler, an actress with Colombian heritage, as Snow White; Zegler was hit by another backlash when she described the prince in the original cartoon as a \"stalker\"; Peter Dinklage said that the portrayal of the dwarves was \"backwards\"; and Stuart Heritage in the Guardian slated the trailer as \"arguably the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\", adding that \"the design of the new dwarves feels like something that would be deliberately shown to prisoners of war to break their spirit\". On the other hand, Disney's Snow White boasts new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (La La Land, The Greatest Showman) and a screenplay co-written by Greta Gerwig (Barbie), so its modern take on a classic fairy tale could still be a gold mine, or even a diamond mine.\nReleased in cinemas internationally on 21 March\nIf you like twisty satirical chillers set in the exclusive enclaves of super-rich eccentrics (Glass Onion, Blink Twice, The Menu \u2013 you know the sort of thing), then you're in luck: A24 has two on offer this month. In Death of a Unicorn, a father and daughter (Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega) are driving through a nature reserve owned by the father's wealthy boss (Richard E Grant) when their car crashes into a unicorn. Yes, it turns out that these fairy-tale creatures are real, and so are the magical healing properties they're reputed to have. Grant's character and his family \u2013 played by Tea Leoni and Will Poulter \u2013 are keen to exploit these properties, so a team of scientists sets about slicing up the animal's body to determine whether it really can cure cancer. Meanwhile, Opus (released on 14 March in the US) features Ayo Edebiri as a young reporter invited to the compound of a reclusive rock star played by John Malkovich.\nReleased on 28 March in the US and 4 April in the UK\nTwo months on from the release of Steven Soderbergh's last film, Presence, the ever-busy director is back with Black Bag, a spy thriller written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park). Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender play a British married couple who are also suave secret agents \u2013 a combination which isn't a problem until the wife is suspected of treason and the husband has to investigate. \"I [thought] it might be interesting to make [Edward Albee's play] Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but George and Martha are in the intelligence community,\" Soderbergh told The Hollywood Reporter. \"What would that be like? So it's a very, very specific take on people who are in the intelligence business but also have complex personal, emotional lives.\" The stellar cast includes Tom Burke, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page and Marisa Abela, along with two former James Bond regulars, Pierce Brosnan and Naomie Harris.\nReleased on 14 March in cinemas internationally\nThe Alto Knights is a crime thriller about two rival Italian American mob bosses, Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, who go from being best friends to archenemies in 1950s New York. It's directed by Barry Levinson, who made Bugsy, it's scripted by Nicholas Pileggi, the co-writer of Goodfellas, and it stars none other than Robert De Niro, so a fact-based gangster film could hardly have a more promising team behind it. The most intriguing part of the project, though, is that De Niro plays both Costello and Genovese, with just enough prosthetic make-up to stop the characters looking like identical twins. Levinson's explanation for this surprising casting? \"As kids, they were very much the same,\" the director said in Empire. \"Two guys were almost one, then they suddenly not only divide, but ultimately become enemies.\" Whether or not you're convinced, you can't complain about having two De Niro performances for the price of one.\nReleased on 21 March in the UK, the US, Canada, Ireland and Spain\nFive years after Bong Joon Ho's Parasite won the Oscars for best picture, best director, best screenplay and best international feature film, the Korean writer-director is back at last with an English-language science-fiction caper. Adapted from Edward Ashton's novel, Mickey 17 stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey, a lowly labourer on a spaceship bound for an ice planet in the year 2054. He is killed on a regular basis, but he is always \"reprinted\", with his memories and personality intact. But what happens when someone makes a mistake, and two different incarnations of Mickey are alive at the same time? David Ehrlich says in IndieWire that: \"the best and most cohesive of Bong's English-language films [is] his biggest swing to date, a wry, delightful, and resoundingly sweet mega-budget space adventure that doesn't seem to be aware that it was made by a major American studio\". On the other hand, the BBC's Hugh Montgomery felt that Mickey 17 was a \"serious disappointment\".\nReleased from 6 March in cinemas internationally\nThe horrifying story of how Charles Manson brainwashed his followers to murder innocent people in 1969 has been told in many dramas and documentaries: Quentin Tarantino even included it in Once Upon a Time\u2026 In Hollywood. But Chaos, a book by Tom O'Neill with Dan Piepenbring, argues that there is more to the story than the official version of events. According to Elisabeth Garber-Paul in Rolling Stone, the book ponders: \"the links between one of America's most notorious criminals and the government's super-secretive mind-control program MKULTRA\", and asks some disturbing questions: \"What explains the similarities between government funded, LSD-fueled mind-control experiments, and Manson's techniques? And why were there so many people in his orbit who seemed to have ties to the CIA?\" Now this investigation, which consumed 20 years of O'Neill's life, serves as the basis of a documentary by Errol Morris, the legendary director of The Thin Blue Line, The Fog of War and The Pigeon Tunnel.\nReleased on 7 March on Netflix internationally\nDirectors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely worked together on two of the biggest hits in cinema history, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Their next collaboration, The Gray Man, wasn't so well-received, but their new film sees them return to their comfort zone, ie, it's a visual effects-packed science-fiction epic. Based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, a Swedish artist and author, The Electric State is set in a dystopian alternate 1990s where the human race has won a war against robotkind, and the remaining \"bots\" have been exiled to a walled-off desert called the Exclusion Zone. Millie Bobby Brown plays an orphaned teenager, who treks across the Zone in search of her long-lost brother, and Chris Pratt plays a war veteran who goes with her. The only trouble is that the film's story is quite different from the novel's, and some of St\u00e5lenhag's fans aren't happy. \"Fan expectations are complicated,\" Joe Russo told\u00a0Digital Spy. \"There are characters that are directly out of the graphic novel and then there are characters that are completely invented and inspired by it.\"\nReleased on 14 March on Netflix internationally\nOne of this month's two \"having-your-life-changed-by-a-pet-you-didn't-really-want\" comedy dramas (the other being The Friend), The Penguin Lessons is based on a memoir by Tom Michell, and is directed by Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty). Steve Coogan plays Tom, an English teacher who gets what he imagines will be a cushy job in a boys' school in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1976. But there are two complications. One is that Argentina is in the midst of a military coup. The other is that Tom rescued a penguin he found drenched in oil on a beach, and now the bird won't leave him alone. Luckily enough, the penguin's presence in his classroom helps to motivate his pupils \u2013 and it might just teach the cynical Tom a lesson or two. Isabella Soares says in Collider that: \"Cattaneo's latest project is delightful and meaningful\", thanks to Coogan's \"charming\" performance and \"the script's keen eye for comedy in the face of a tumultuous backdrop\".\nReleased on 28 March in the US\nTwo films adapted from novels by Sigrid Nunez premiered last year, both of them musings on death and friendship among literary New Yorkers. One was Pedro Almod\u00f3var's The Room Next Door, which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival; the other is The Friend, which stars Naomi Watts, Bill Murray, and the most gigantic canine to be squeezed into a Manhattan apartment since Clifford the Big Red Dog. Watts plays an author named Iris, and Murray plays her roguish mentor Walter. After he kills himself, Iris has to look after his Great Dane, and finds that the dog is sadder about Walter's death than most of the human beings who knew him. Steve Pond in The Wrap says: \"The Friend juggles the happy, the sad and the bittersweet while somehow managing not to lose the lightness that has kept it afloat.\"\nReleased on 21 March in the US\nAlain Guiraudie, the French writer-director of the award-winning Stranger by the Lake, returns with another blackly comic, sexually charged thriller. F\u00e9lix Kysyl plays J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, a young man who returns to his rural hometown for the funeral of his mentor, a local baker. The baker's widow (Catherine Frot) invites him to stay in the family home, and perhaps even take over the family business, much to the resentment of the couple's grown-up son, Vincent (Jean-Baptiste Durand). And then someone disappears in the mossy woodland by the village. Isaac Feldberg at RogerEbert.com calls Guiraudie's film \"another elegantly haunting dissection of the power dynamics shaping queer sexuality, this time in the form of a fantastically tender, alluring, and peculiar small-town tale of murder, desire, and repression\".\nReleased on 14 March in Spain, 21 March in the US, and 28 March in the UK and Ireland\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.\nHis sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.\nA tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. \nIf you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.\nOne of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. \nDuring what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nThe exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nIt escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be \"thankful\" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" \nThe Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.\nIn a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" \n\"He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" Trump said.\nAhead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. \nZelensky had said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. \nNotably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nBut Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.\nTrump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. \nA big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \nOn the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for \"a significant reduction\" in their staff by 13 March.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.\nTrump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter the meeting, Macron said Trump had \"good reason\" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. \nTrump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nPart way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nTrump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.\nThe clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the \"riviera\" of the Middle East.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (\u00a3792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. \nOfficials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.\nTrump unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (\u00a33.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\nThe president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to \"high-level people\".\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. \nIt includes $4.5 trillion (\u00a33.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.\nHowever, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.\nTrump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.\n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.",

        "article_text": "JD Vance's remarkable dressing down of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday showed the US vice-president unafraid to take centre stage as an attack dog, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy.\nIt was Vance who led the attack on Zelensky before Donald Trump joined the fray at the White House in a meeting that had been cordial until the vice-president spoke up to laud the president for seeking what he described as a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\" said Zelensky, who has been critical of direct talks between Washington and Moscow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded, tearing into the stunned Ukrainian leader.\n\"Mr President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\nHe also accused Zelensky of having campaigned on behalf of Democrats during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a munitions factory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met Trump's rival, Kamala Harris, at the White House.\nVance's upbraiding of Zelensky drew broad support among Republicans.\n\"I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country,\" said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy hawk. He suggested Zelensky should resign.\nAlabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as \"that Ukrainian weasel\".\nCongressman Mike Lawyer of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was \"a missed opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine\".\nVance's remarkable attack on a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president.\nTheir job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency.\nThe contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater.\nBut Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly sceptical of US aid to Ukraine.\nWhen he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: \"I've got to be honest with you. I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\"\nThe vice-president derided Trump as an idiot eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement.\nDespite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was \"too early\" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028.\nUndeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political brawler for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken criticism of the administration's foes.\nOne common thread is that many victims of Vance's tongue-lashing are America's allies.\nIt began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there.\nBut Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.\n\"If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,\" he said.\nThe audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified.\nThis was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.\nThis was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.\nNot for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.\nHis speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.\nYet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.\nVance accused him of \"moralistic garbage\", \"historical illiteracy\" and - worst of all - of being a \"globalist\".\nAnd if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.\nOut of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\".\nThe prime minister pushed back firmly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\u2026 We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\".\nThis was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.\nThe aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.\nSeveral questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe?\nWhite House sources have told US papers it was not.\nIs Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents?\nOr is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?\nWhatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.",

Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would haven't been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "The Brit Awards belonged to Charli XCX on Saturday night, who completed her transformation from underground hero to bona fide pop star by winning five awards including best artist and song of the year.\nEzra Collective, Sam Fender, Stormzy and The Last Dinner Party were the other big British winners on Saturday night, while Fontaines DC and Chappell Roan bagged the international awards. \nThe night also included a memorable, blush-inducing performance from US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter, who was handed the global success award at London's O2 Arena.\nThe arena fell silent near the end of the show for a moving video tribute to the late Liam Payne, who died last October.\nDespite not performing, Charli XCX stole the show by winning the biggest awards of the night - artist of the year, album of the year for her cultural phenomenon Brat, and song of the year for Guess.\n\"This is cool, I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff\", said Charli, dryly, on stage after collecting her first award.\n \"I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not sure what.\"\nShe went on to thank Eilish - the first non-Brit to appear on a best song-winner - for her guest vocals on Guess which she delivered at just three days notice. \"Thank you Billie for running and gunning...\"\nShe also picked up the best dance act and songwriter of the year awards.\nIn her speech for best dance act, she spoke of the importance of the night-time genre. \"I feel like dance music, electronic music gets a really bad rep' because everyone is like, 'it's not that deep, is it?'. And I kind of feel it is,\" she said.\n\"This genre of music for me is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nAs she collected her fifth and final award of the night for best album, Charli told the crowd how she had \"always felt like an outsider\" up until this point.\n\"Culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us - I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.\nIt's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.\nFans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule Britannia and a, ahem, close encounter with a beefeater.\nCarpenter also became the first international star to accept the global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of espresso.\"\nWearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.\nBest pop act winner, Jade - of little mix Fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.\nIn it she appeared in a blonde wig and big white fur coat before disappearing briefly somewhere in a crowd of dancers and re-emerging as an angel suspended above the stage. \nSeveral artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.\nJazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".\nChappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".\nRising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\" while urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.\nIt was also a night that marked the return of Sam Fender, with the Geordie singer-songwriter picking up the best alternative/rock act.\nHe thanked his band in his speech, saying he would just be a \"mad man shouting at walls\" without them.\nIt marks the end of a huge week for Fender, who also topped the UK album charts with People Watching - which had the biggest opening week for a British album since Harry Styles' Harry's House in 2022.\nHe topped off the evening with an emphatic performance of its title track.\nBest hip-hop winner Stormzy thanked Jesus and read a verse from the bible before explaining the was wearing shades as he had \"mashed my eye up playing padel\".\nBest R&B act winner Raye said via video that she was \"still recovering\" from last year's event when she won a record-breaking six awards.\nDublin rock band Fontaines D.C said they were \"buzzing\" to win best international group and did so, fittingly, from Down Under.\nAnd Teddy Swims performed his hit Lose Control on a flame-filled stage - a potential fire hazard in his baggy oversized jacket - before Lola Young played her viral hit in a Messy makeshift room.\nIt's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.\nHe poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".\nAnd referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".\nAiming a light dig at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".\nHaving flown over from US filming commitments a few days ago, he showed little signs of jet lag in his bid to \"Make the Brits Great Again\", as he had joked in a pre-show video this week.\n\"If you thought Trump-Zelensky was cringe then wait until you hear me...\" he quipped.\nIt reached peak cringe though when his parents appeared alongside him in one segment, with his dad dressed as Kanye West.\nThe biggest cheer of the night came when actor Danny Dyer told Whitehall that \"the world is being run by cranks\".\nLiam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina last October, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.\nThe ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.\n\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.\nSeven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.\nThere were also snubs for royal royalty The Beatles, Coldplay and The Cure, who like Dua, all lost out to Charli in various catergories.\nLet's hope they're not too Bratty about it.",

Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

Next step is Champions League and now the focus is there.\"\nEven more exciting for Villa fans is the understanding he appears to be developing with Marcus Rashford, another winter window signing after the England forward joined on loan from Manchester United.\nHe provided the assist for Asensio's opener against Cardiff, meaning all three of his assists for Villa so far have been for goals scored by the Spanish midfielder.\n\"Marcus [Rashford] is a top player,\" Asensio added. \n\"We are together not so much but I know what he wants to do, where he passes and I am very happy to have Marcus and all of the team-mates.\"\nMarco Asensio has scored four goals in six games for Aston Villa\nAsensio was perhaps destined to be a footballer, with his father having named him after legendary Netherlands striker Marco van Basten.\nBut the 29-year-old has forged an impressive career in his own right. \nAfter starting out at Mallorca, he had a spell at Espanyol before joining Real Madrid, where he helped the Spanish giants with La Liga four times and the Champions League three times.\nIn total he won 17 trophies at Real, as many as a player considered one of the greatest in world football - Alfredo Di Stefano.\nAfter seven seasons at Real he made the move to French giants PSG, helping them to win a domestic treble last year.\nGiven the success he has enjoyed, joining a club not currently challenging for league titles no doubt raised an eyebrow.\nBut Unai Emery has been a long-time admirer of Asensio and played a key role in his signing.\n\"Unai has tried to get Asensio in at least three windows,\" Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.\n\"He has always said to Unai he wanted to work with him and develop with him.\"\nThe clincher for Emery appears to have been the promise of playing Asensio in the number 10 position.\n\"He hasn't played there since Mallorca,\" added Balague.  \n\"At Madrid he wasn't allowed, so that was the discussion he had with Unai. He was told number 10 and you can see the good consequences of it.\"\nAsensio is not the only player who is flourishing since moving to Aston Villa, with Rashford appearing to be putting behind him a difficult season at Manchester United with a strong start to life in the Midlands.\nRashford had been struggling for form at Old Trafford and found himself out of the picture under Ruben Amorim.\nBut the move to Villa and playing alongside Asensio appears to bringing him back to his best.\nSince his debut on 9 February, Rashford has created more chances in all competitions than any other Premier League player (13).\nAgainst Cardiff, Rashford created six chances for Aston Villa, equalling the most he ever created in any of his 426 matches for Manchester United (six vs Wigan in January 2024).\nHe has yet to score, although given his performances so far that will surely come sooner rather than later.\n\"Aston Villa have given him a lifeline,\" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on ITV Sport. \n\"It seems to have come to an end at Manchester United. He needed to rebuild his confidence, he is 27 and has to show he has a lot to give. Villa have given him a good opportunity.\n\"Things could be very exciting here at Aston Villa with this new exciting Aston Villa forward line.\"\nWith a Champions League last-16 game at Club Brugge up next, Emery believes Asensio and Rashford maintaining their form is key to Villa achieving their ambitions this season.\n\"We need [Asensio] and we need Rashford,\" he said.\n\"We need the players who joined in the last window.

        "article_text": "The crime scene was a bloodbath. The victim, stabbed multiple times, had tried to defend himself. In the process, the suspect is also thought to have lost blood.\nThe attacker is still at large. \n\"It's quite a frustrating case,\" says Jo Ward, crime scene coordinator at West Midlands Police, \"because I don't actually think I've had a case that has not been solved in my 27 years, so it doesn't sit right with me.\"\nJo has dealt with more than 50 murders, and is determined to track down the killer of her only unsolved case - an investigation featured in the new BBC series of Forensics: The Real CSI.\nOn 9 February 2022, Jo was called to investigate the murder of a Chinese national, Jinming Zhang, 41, in a flat in Digbeth, Birmingham.\nIt quickly became apparent that the flat was being used as a brothel and the only witness to the brutal murder was a young Chinese woman who had hid from the killer. \nOriginally the motive was thought to have been robbery - drawers on a bedside table had been pulled out and the property searched. But this could not be confirmed.\nAs crime scene coordinator, Jo was first on the scene, combing the property for evidence. Throughout the investigation, she worked alongside other specialists, such as blood pattern analysts and CCTV coordinators to try to piece together everything that happened that night.\nPolice believe the murder suspect may have sustained a hand injury in the frenzied attack.\nBlood pattern analysis, a technique used to interpret the bloodstains at the crime scene, helped to determine which of the blood spots in the flat may have belonged to the victim and which could have been the killer's.\nA blood trail was detected leading away from the property, and hours of CCTV footage was analysed to track the killer's escape route.\nThe suspect was a black man, between 5ft 2in (1.6m) and 5ft 5in (1.7m) tall and of slim build. CCTV also revealed he had an unusual way of walking.\nAlthough a DNA sample of the suspect was found, there were no matches on the national DNA database - which holds the DNA profiles of about 5.9 million people who have been arrested and cautioned, or convicted of a crime.\nThe case is still ongoing and no-one has yet been charged with the murder.\nThis would have been the end of the road 10 years ago, says Jo, but developments in forensics have meant familial DNA searches could also be used to try to identify potential biological relatives of the suspect who might also be on the national database.\n\"In the 27 years I've been in [the police], I've never carried out that kind of search before,\" says Jo.\nThe use of familial DNA search is not the only advancement in forensics, says Jo, the sample size needed to get a full DNA profile has also changed dramatically.\n\"Years ago we used to have to have quite a large amount of blood, or any other cellular material, to then actually get a DNA profile from it,\" she says. \"Nowadays, we literally need a pinprick size amount of blood or any other cellular material to be able to get a full profile.\"\nPreviously, as well as blood, the main DNA sources would have been cigarettes. But now, anything that has been in contact with the lips and saliva can also be swabbed to provide a DNA profile, says Jo, such as cans, bottles of drinks and, increasingly, vapes. \nCellular DNA can also be found when someone has simply touched an item, says Jo.\n\"Obviously when we have murders or sexual assaults, we're always looking at [whether] the item of clothing [has] been gripped by the offender at all during the assault. It's about targeting those areas to then see if you can obtain the DNA from that.\"\nBut while techniques have improved, getting answers is not always as fast as Jo would like.\n\"It's not like your CSI Miami,\" says Jo, \"where they get a DNA and literally within an hour they get results.\"\nShe is hopeful the identification process will speed up in the future.\n\"Obviously fingerprints have always been around and we recover them with powder and send them in,\" says Jo. \"I think digitally there will be something that comes up in the future where it's a simple, take a photo, scan straightway, and it'll be a quicker turnaround on identification.\"\nWalking into so many murder scenes over the years has had an impact on Jo. She gets the same feelings of apprehension approaching every scene, with butterflies in her stomach.\n\"Sometimes I feel sick after I've come out and not wanting to eat, but I've really got a mindset now where I think: 'Ok I can't change what's happened but what I can do is my utmost to then identify the person responsible and get justice for the victim and the family.'\"\nJo suffered with PTSD after a murder investigation in the past, which she says taught her a lot. To avoid a recurrence, she tries not to get emotionally attached.\n\"I think that's the mistake I made when I had my PTSD, that I was looking at all the family photographs,\" says Jo.\n\"It's a tough job but it's also a very rewarding job when you get that result and you identify the suspect and they get charged.\"\nWhen it comes to her only unsolved case, Jo is hoping someone will come forward after watching the programme and remember something that could lead to the identification of the suspect.\nShe also has a message for the killer: \"We need to get justice for the victim and the family. Do the right thing and come forward.\"\nForensics: The Real CSI - Murder in a Brothel is on Sunday 2 March at 21:00 GMT on BBC Two and from 06:00 GMT on BBC iPlayer\nDetails of help and support for victims of crime are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "Barry Ferguson suffered defeat in his home debut as Rangers head coach\n\"It's not good enough.\" \nNot the words Rangers interim head coach Barry Ferguson might have expected to be saying in the aftermath of his return to Ibrox, this time in charge, after the departure of Philippe Clement.\nOff the back of a rousing 4-2 fightback win at Kilmarnock in his first outing, this was set up to be a positive homecoming, during which captain James Tavernier made his 500th appearance for the club.\nYou could feel that pre-match. Like a weight had been lifted. Yet it went horribly wrong - again. \nMotherwell win to ruin Ferguson's Ibrox return\nCeltic thump five past St Mirren to extend Premiership lead\nRangers stumbled to a third straight defeat at Ibrox. Queens Park, St Mirren and now Motherwell, by 2-1, all victorious. Unthinkable and certainly unpalatable for the Rangers support as they, once again, demonstrated at full-time. \nAt least the minority that remained at Ibrox come that point. Certainly \"not good enough\".\nRangers are now 16 points behind Celtic with nine games remaining. They have either lost or drawn almost 38% of their league fixtures. \nFerguson looked increasingly agonised by a tepid, lacklustre display during which Motherwell took full advantage to earn a fantastic win, just their second in 61 league meetings between these sides.\nIt would be incredibly harsh to lay blame at Ferguson's feet, but the short-lived honeymoon seems over already. \nThe former Rangers captain has some serious issues to address - and quickly - as this squad looks increasingly unreliable, domestically at least.\n\"There's obviously a clear problem in terms of playing at home and that's something me as a manager and my staff and the players need to sit down and really get to the bottom of,\" Ferguson said.\nWorryingly for him, Ibrox was the one source of solace for much of this season as domestic away form deserted Rangers under Clement until late in his tenure. That home comfort has now imploded. \nSo what is the issue? \n\"There's good players here, I've seen it,\" Ferguson continued. \"Technically, very good. To play at Rangers, they need to be mentally strong. The fans demand that of you.\"\nOn this evidence, the mentality has been shredded. Experienced goalkeeper Jack Butland was culpable for the opener with a poor reaction save to allow Luke Armstrong to net the opener. His confidence looks diminished, as it does in many of his team-mates.\nThey were brutally exposed by some fine play from Motherwell for the second. \nMore concerning for Ferguson was the lack of energy throughout. It rarely felt that Rangers would go on and mount a winning comeback. \nThey cannot possibly win silverware, other than in Europe, where they face a stiff last 16 first-leg test away to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbache on Thursday. \nWill the Europa League version of this Jekyll and Hyde Rangers turn up again?\n\"Well, that's what happens when you play at Rangers,\" Ferguson explained.\n\"European football's great. It's great to be involved in. It's great financially for the club, but your bread and butter is domestic trophies. \n\"Domestically, the form has to be better. Europe's always been a bonus. It's brilliant to go and pit your wits against really good teams and really good managers and really good players, but what matters? Domestic football for me.\"\nRangers will hope that bonus of European form continues as their domestic season lies in tatters.\nIt was another painful home defeat for the home supporters, who must have hoped the familiar face of Ferguson in charge would bring short-term relief and steady the ship. It has not.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

        "article_text": "French photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 captured this dystopian scene as the world headed towards lockdown in February 2020.\nOn Saturday 25 January 2020, millions of Chinese people started celebrating the Lunar New Year. The country's megacities saw huge temporary migrations as people left to celebrate with friends and family in distant towns and cities, as they did every January.\nThat year, however, there was a dramatic difference. Many of the people who left to celebrate were unable to return for weeks or even months. A type of pneumonia that had appeared in the western Chinese city of Wuhan the previous December had quietly became a concern. By the time Chinese revellers boarded trains and planes home a month later it had become a crisis.\nFrench photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 was in Beijing at that very moment, as the seriousness of the Wuhan virus became more evident. \"The photo editor at the New York Times had asked me to roam Beijing and take some pictures of the atmosphere. I just gotten back from holidays and I didn't know what to expect.\"\nWuhan was already in lockdown, though these measures hadn't yet been adopted by other Chinese cities. Even so, Sabri\u00e9 found the city sombre and eerily quiet. \"There were very, very few people anywhere. Most restaurants were closed. Everybody was worried that the disease would spread to Beijing.\n\"What made the situation probably more anxious is people didn't have much trust in what the authorities were saying. Initially, they had said there was no human-to-human transmission, then, just a few days later, they reverse and then go into full lockdown for Wuhan, a city of 10 million.\"\nSabri\u00e9 says the Chinese authorities had stressed that there had been few deaths in Beijing, a city of 23 million people. \"The question is, could we trust those figures? That was a big thing,\" Sabri\u00e9 says. Beijing's citizens began to shy away from the routines of city life, encouraged by public health messages to limit the spread. \"It was not a firm lockdown, like you had to stay home, but basically, you were encouraged to limit your movements,\" Sabri\u00e9 says.\nThe result was an eerie emptiness in a city usually bustling with life. The subways were empty; those who hadn't left for the provinces were staying home. The stillness was dramatic, but lacked a human reference point. \"It was quite paradoxical, because when you need to shoot something empty, actually you need people. If it's fully empty, it's not as strong.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Covid-19: The heat-showing shape of things to come\n\u2022\u00a0Is Covid becoming less deadly?\n\u2022\u00a0Why Covid-19 isn't yet seasonal\nSabri\u00e9 had an idea. Near Beijing is a resort area called Lake Houhai, a locale with many traditional houses and usually packed with sightseers day and night. When he turned up, \"it was around dinner time\", Sabri\u00e9 says, when the area would usually be crowded with people. \"This place is a must-see for any tourist, Chinese or foreign, who comes and visits Beijing. It's full of bars [and] tourist shops. Those bars usually play very loud music\u2026 each bar is louder than the next one, trying to attract more people.\"\nInstead, the bars were silent and the streets empty. Then Sabri\u00e9 spotted just one bar that wasn\u2019t completely void of life. Behind the pane of a large window, sat a lone man, softly illuminated by an overhead light. \"He was there by himself in the middle of this place which should have been bustling with life and music and sound and people,\" says Sabri\u00e9. But there was this man \"having his dinner from plastic dishes, his only companion a cat unaware of what was going on, of the tension and the anxiety\".\nThe photo is a scene in which more appears the longer you look at it. The man sits amid the normal detritus of a makeshift meal, his face gently lit by the glow of his phone. Around him lies the plush bar seating, a red pillar, the lights of bar in the background. At the bottom of the frame, a cat crouches on the back of a sofa. It could have been snapped in the small hours, once all the revellers have headed home. But instead, it's a marker: the end of normal life as a megacity hunkers down.\n\"I didn't get into the bar,\" Sabri\u00e9 explains. \"I just put my camera against [the] window. I don't think he ever noticed me, and I took the picture and moved on.\"\u00a0\nSabri\u00e9 says he thought little of the image after he took it, but the picture clearly resonated with the New York Times picture desk: the image was used as part of their The Great Empty special, published the following month. Sabri\u00e9 notes that the figure is unmasked \u2013 something that was becoming rare to see on the streets as the pandemic ramped up.\nSabri\u00e9's appreciation for the image has grown with the distance of five years. \"You have the darkness that reflects the darkness of the time, and the anxiety that we were feeling,\" he says. \"If you look closely at the picture, the [man] is looking at his phone.\"\nThis, Sabri\u00e9 adds, depicts another kind of darkness \"in terms of information and knowledge\" as people scoured the internet for information, in a desperate effort to understand what was happening to the world.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

He said that he had worked on strengthening the agency's machine learning and AI tools.\nCalifornian Democratic Congressman Jared Huffman said people across the US \"depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information\". \nNOAA weather data is used by meteorologists, media organisations, commerical forecasting services and other companies to inform the US public about the weather. The agency produces the latest information on temperature, precipitation, air quality, UV index, humidity and more. \nThis data is used extensively in the private sector to fuel popular weather services and websites.\n\"Most or all private weather companies in US (including forecasts that you see on TV or your favorite app) are built directly atop backbone of taxpayer-funded instrumentation, data, predictive modeling, & forecasts provided by NOAA,\" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles wrote on X.\nThe agency has proved essential during periods of extreme weather conditions as well. The National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service - housed under NOAA - create models and notify millions of Americans when and how to respond to severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. \nHuffman lamented the loss of \"hundreds of scientists and experts at NOAA\" who helped collect infromation that kept the public safe during dangerous weather events. \n\"Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives,\" the congressman said.\nMiyoko Sakashita, the Center for Biological Diversity's oceans director, said gutting NOAA will \"hamstring essential lifesaving\" programmes.\nThe latest developments come days after US government workers faced widespread confusion following conflicting advice over compliance with a Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination.\nThe message sent to millions of federal employees last Saturday evening came after Musk posted on his social media platform X that government staff would \"shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week\".\nOn Sunday, Musk said in some cases \"we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks\". \nIn a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to respond explaining their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information.\nBut, key agencies, including the Departments of Defense (DoD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, the Pentagon and the FBI - now led by Trump appointees -instructed employees to ignore the directive.\nAgencies such as the Department of Transportation, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency encouraged their staff to comply, according to reports.\nOn Wednesday, Musk reiterated the suggestion that a number of federal employees who did not respond to an email requesting a summary of their achievements from the previous week could be \"dead\" or \"not real people\", but offered no facts to back it up.\nSpeaking at Trump's first cabinet meeting, Musk told reporters: \"I think that email perhaps was best interpreted as a performance review, but actually it was a pulse check review. \n\"Do you have a pulse? Do you have a pulse? And two neurons. So if you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email.\"\nElsewhere on Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.\nDistrict Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including at the defence department.",

        "article_text": "The Cook Islands may be small but the ambitions of its leader are mighty. \nA range of deals Prime Minister Mark Brown signed with China without consulting the public or New Zealand \u2013 an ally to which the Cooks is closely tied \u2013 has caused increasing irritation and concern.\nThe agreements are the first of their kind with a country that is not a traditional ally. They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.\nBrown says his decisions will be based on the \"long-term interests\" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change. \nNot everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally. \nNew Zealand said it was \"blindsided\" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.\nHe has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening. \nThe rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.\nBut now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable. \nThe Cook Islands has had what's known as a \"free association\" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.\nThe two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island M\u0101ori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand M\u0101ori. \nThe deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry. \n\"[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the M\u0101ori word for New Zealand] \u2013 they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,\" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China. \nIn a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: \"Stay connected with NZ\". Others waved their New Zealand passports. \n\"Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?\" Ms Tuara said. \"We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us \u2013 for our children, for their future.\"\nBut for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.\nChina specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that \"the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities\". \nHe believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are \"all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.\"\nWhile the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.\nIn response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.\nLast week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.\n\"It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],\" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\"It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.\"\nChina's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it. \nAustralia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.\n\"I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,\" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. \"China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?\"\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits \"we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality\".  \nIn speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.\n\"[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,\" Philipp Ivanov says. \"Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.\"\nBut it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.\n\"Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make \u2026 and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,\" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.\nBut, he adds, they also have \"enormous commonalities\" - China is Australia's largest  trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.\n\"So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.\"\nIt's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.\nAlthough many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.\nAnd now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.\n\"I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,\" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.\n\"I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.\"",

Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.\nSabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards. \nArriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.\nBetter still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set. \nA former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).\nHopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short n' Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.\nLiam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.\nGossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Zayn and Louis both on tour, that seems unlikely.\nAccording to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".\nQuoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.\n\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"\nIt's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.\n\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony. \n\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"\nHe's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.\nBut in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".\n\nWith 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT. International viewers can watch the show on the official Brits YouTube channel.\nBBC News will be live from the red carpet from 16:30GMT - with a live page providing coverage throughout the night. \nArtist of the year\nGroup of the year\nAlbum of the Year\nRead the full list of nominees here.\n",

They were like Derry das on tour,\" says Alannagh.\n\"Everybody was sitting together to have dinner before the show and they invited us up on stage to play Teenage Kicks with them which was extremely exciting.\"\nSpeaking before the Belfast show, Hannah said she was extremely nervous about playing support to Snow Patrol but would \"love every minute\".\nDuring the gig, Lightbody dedicated Snow Patrol's performance of Chasing Cars to the band's support acts CHERYM and Nina Nesbitt.",

The country's megacities saw huge temporary migrations as people left to celebrate with friends and family in distant towns and cities, as they did every January.\nThat year, however, there was a dramatic difference. Many of the people who left to celebrate were unable to return for weeks or even months. A type of pneumonia that had appeared in the western Chinese city of Wuhan the previous December had quietly became a concern. By the time Chinese revellers boarded trains and planes home a month later it had become a crisis.\nFrench photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 was in Beijing at that very moment, as the seriousness of the Wuhan virus became more evident. \"The photo editor at the New York Times had asked me to roam Beijing and take some pictures of the atmosphere. I just gotten back from holidays and I didn't know what to expect.\"\nWuhan was already in lockdown, though these measures hadn't yet been adopted by other Chinese cities. Even so, Sabri\u00e9 found the city sombre and eerily quiet. \"There were very, very few people anywhere. Most restaurants were closed. Everybody was worried that the disease would spread to Beijing.\n\"What made the situation probably more anxious is people didn't have much trust in what the authorities were saying. Initially, they had said there was no human-to-human transmission, then, just a few days later, they reverse and then go into full lockdown for Wuhan, a city of 10 million.\"\nSabri\u00e9 says the Chinese authorities had stressed that there had been few deaths in Beijing, a city of 23 million people. \"The question is, could we trust those figures? That was a big thing,\" Sabri\u00e9 says. Beijing's citizens began to shy away from the routines of city life, encouraged by public health messages to limit the spread. \"It was not a firm lockdown, like you had to stay home, but basically, you were encouraged to limit your movements,\" Sabri\u00e9 says.\nThe result was an eerie emptiness in a city usually bustling with life. The subways were empty; those who hadn't left for the provinces were staying home. The stillness was dramatic, but lacked a human reference point. \"It was quite paradoxical, because when you need to shoot something empty, actually you need people. If it's fully empty, it's not as strong.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Covid-19: The heat-showing shape of things to come\n\u2022\u00a0Is Covid becoming less deadly?\n\u2022\u00a0Why Covid-19 isn't yet seasonal\nSabri\u00e9 had an idea. Near Beijing is a resort area called Lake Houhai, a locale with many traditional houses and usually packed with sightseers day and night. When he turned up, \"it was around dinner time\", Sabri\u00e9 says, when the area would usually be crowded with people. \"This place is a must-see for any tourist, Chinese or foreign, who comes and visits Beijing. It's full of bars [and] tourist shops. Those bars usually play very loud music\u2026 each bar is louder than the next one, trying to attract more people.\"\nInstead, the bars were silent and the streets empty. Then Sabri\u00e9 spotted just one bar that wasn\u2019t completely void of life. Behind the pane of a large window, sat a lone man, softly illuminated by an overhead light. \"He was there by himself in the middle of this place which should have been bustling with life and music and sound and people,\" says Sabri\u00e9. But there was this man \"having his dinner from plastic dishes, his only companion a cat unaware of what was going on, of the tension and the anxiety\".\nThe photo is a scene in which more appears the longer you look at it. The man sits amid the normal detritus of a makeshift meal, his face gently lit by the glow of his phone. Around him lies the plush bar seating, a red pillar, the lights of bar in the background. At the bottom of the frame, a cat crouches on the back of a sofa. It could have been snapped in the small hours, once all the revellers have headed home. But instead, it's a marker: the end of normal life as a megacity hunkers down.\n\"I didn't get into the bar,\" Sabri\u00e9 explains. \"I just put my camera against [the] window. I don't think he ever noticed me, and I took the picture and moved on.\"\u00a0\nSabri\u00e9 says he thought little of the image after he took it, but the picture clearly resonated with the New York Times picture desk: the image was used as part of their The Great Empty special, published the following month. Sabri\u00e9 notes that the figure is unmasked \u2013 something that was becoming rare to see on the streets as the pandemic ramped up.\nSabri\u00e9's appreciation for the image has grown with the distance of five years. \"You have the darkness that reflects the darkness of the time, and the anxiety that we were feeling,\" he says. \"If you look closely at the picture, the [man] is looking at his phone.\"\nThis, Sabri\u00e9 adds, depicts another kind of darkness \"in terms of information and knowledge\" as people scoured the internet for information, in a desperate effort to understand what was happening to the world.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nThe 21-year-old, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nEdie points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nAlso involved in the film was Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance.\nShe says Madison installed a pole at her house in LA, and the pair began working on her \"sexy routine\".\n\"She put in so much work,\" Schneider, 28, said. \"She was so determined.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Schneider, meanwhile, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

        "article_text": "Jessica Sergis scored a hat-trick of second-half tries - as Australia scored 17 in total\nAmy Hardcastle compared the experience to being in a washing machine. Jodie Cunningham said it was evidence of the work English women's rugby league still has to do.\nEngland's experience in Las Vegas could hardly have been more chastening. A 90-4 defeat by Australia was the biggest the Lionesses - either as England or Great Britain - have ever suffered.\nBoth captain Cunningham and centre Hardcastle, interviewed on the pitch moments after a shattering result, were quick to pinpoint the reasons for it: they couldn't get enough of the ball, and so ended up spending much of the 70 minutes trying to defend against the best team in the world.\nHow to use that as a learning experience to avoid a repeat is a tougher question - and one that goes to the heart of the structure of women's rugby league in England.\nThe effort from Stuart Barrow's team never wavered, even as hopes of running their opponents close were shredded. The fact they scored the final try of the match, having conceded 17 before that, spoke volumes of their capacity to keep going.\nThat, in itself, required huge reserves of character.\n\"I think we know what we need to do when we go back home,\" Hardcastle said. \"You can't take anything away from the Jillaroos. \n\"They're absolute athletes and what they get to do in Australia, and how professional they are, and the backing that they get is incredible. And to face them at a top level, it's a privilege to be here.\n\"We've lost, but to be able to be here and give it a go and know what it's like in that battle, in that washing machine, it's been worth that 70 minutes.\"\nThe size of the defeat clearly hurt.\n\"There are always positives to take,\" Cunningham said. \"Right now, it's tough to focus on them, but I think the heart was there, the effort was there, we didn't give up. \n\"I think Georgia Roche getting a try for us right at the end shows that we didn't give up. The effort was there. It was just that they were too good for us. \n\"But I'm proud of the girls. I'm proud of how they kept going and sometimes that's what you've got to take at international rugby.\"\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nAustralia score 90 points against England in Las Vegas - as it happened\nJodie Cunningham acknowledged England did not have enough of the ball against Australia\nIn an interview with Sky Sports before the match, Cunningham had highlighted the gulf in investment between the women's domestic game in Australia and England.\nShe had pointed out how the players in the NRL Women's Premiership (NRLW) were either full-time or semi-professional, while those in England's Women's Super League play for expenses or nothing at all.\nThat gulf was on show at the Allegiant Stadium, as a ruthless Australia side kept on punishing their opponents.\nAnd it provided a significant reality check as England start building towards next year's World Cup.\n\"It shows where women's rugby league's at,\" Cunningham said. \"The growth that's happened over recent years, the investment that's gone into the NRLW is there to see, with the athletes they have and what you can see on show today. \n\"We've got a lot of work to do. But we've got a great squad, we've got a great group of staff and we're willing to put that hard work in to get better.\"\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sport, former Great Britain head coach Jackie Sheldon highlighted the investment Australia have put into their women's game over the past two decades as a key factor in their international dominance - they have won the past three World Cups, and lost just once since 2016.\nShe suggested England have to find a way to compete physically with Australia and New Zealand in order to be able to challenge them.\nGiven the disparity in investment between the domestic game in England and Australia, that may not be a quick process. It may be helped, though, by the experience gained by English players who have moved to the NRLW: Roche plays her club rugby for Newcastle Knights, and Hollie-Mae Dodd for Canberra Raiders, while Paige Travis will start the coming season with Parramatta Eels, having switched from St Helens.\nPerhaps, in time, the painful memories of Vegas will make England better too. As Hardcastle put it: \"The result's hard, but there's a lot we can look at individually, and think: what do we need to do to be better?\"",

        "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted the US to \"stand more firmly on our side\" after a fiery White House exchange with US President Donald Trump on Friday. \nAfter arriving in the UK to take part in a European leaders' summit, Zelensky urged the US to continue its support for Ukraine despite \"the tough dialogue\" between the two sides.\nIt came after a war of words at the Oval Office in which Trump told Zelensky to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\" and US Vice-President JD Vance accused him of being ungrateful.\nOn Saturday, Zelensky thanked UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for \"meaningful and warm meeting\" and said a \u00a32.26bn ($2.8bn) loan to Kyiv had been agreed. \n\n\"The funds will be directed toward weapons production in Ukraine. \n\"I thank the people and government of the United Kingdom for their tremendous support from the very beginning of this war.\n\"We are happy to have such strategic partners and to share the same vision of what a secure future should look like for all.\"\nEarlier, Zelensky published a thread of 14 posts on X in which he reiterated calls for US security guarantees to form part of any \"just and lasting\" peace deal to end the war with Russia.\nHe noted that Trump wanted to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, but added that no-one wanted peace more than Ukraine.\nThe ill-fated White House meeting was intended to precede the signing of a deal to give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. Instead, Zelensky was told to leave early before it could be signed.\nTrump later told reporters that Ukraine's president \"overplayed his hand\" in the exchange and that he would need \"to say 'I want to make peace'\" to restart talks with the US.\nEuropean leaders rallied behind Zelensky, but Nato's secretary general said he must \"find a way\" to restore his relationship with Trump.\nOn Saturday, Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to sign the minerals agreement as \"the first step toward security guarantees\"  from the US - a line he has maintained for days, but which Trump has refused to agree to.\n\"But it's not enough, and we need more than just that,\" he added. \"A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine.\"\nHe added: \"All Ukrainians want to hear a strong US position on our side. It's understandable the US might look for dialogue with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. \n\"But the US has always spoken about 'peace through strength.' And together we can take strong steps against Putin.\"\nIn Russia, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman called Zelensky's visit to Washington a \"complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv\".\nMaria Zakharova said the Ukrainian president is \"obsessed\" with prolonging the war, and repeated Russia's insistence to annex all territories currently occupied by Russia. \n\nAhead of the London summit, where European leaders will further discuss efforts to secure a peace deal, Zelensky met UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who said he retained \"unwavering support for Ukraine\".\nSpeaking inside his office, Sir Keir told Zelensky he was \"very, very welcome here in Downing Street\" and reiterated that the UK would stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it may take\".\nHe added: \"A lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine - so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom.\"\nSenior political figures from across Europe have also rallied behind Ukraine after Friday's extraordinary scenes in the US.\nThe leaders of Germany, France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were among those who posted social media messages backing Ukraine - with Zelensky responding directly to each one to thank them for their support.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron posted: \"There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\"\nGermany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no-one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\".\nSpeaking to the BBC on Saturday, Nato chief Mark Rutte said he had spoken to Zelensky twice following the White House meeting, and told him \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.\nHe referenced the first Trump administration's approval for the sale of Javelin anti-tank missile systems allowed Ukraine to \"fight back\". \nPutin launched the war two years after Trump had left office.\nRussia has been making slow gains on the battlefield for months.\nIn the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, officials said that 12 people, including two children, were injured in a \"massive\" overnight drone strike, a short while after Zelensky left the White House.\nThe casualties included four female patients at a hospital in the city centre. Residential buildings, pharmacies, cafes and shops were also been damaged, the Ukrainian prosecution service said. \nFriday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\nZelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous ceasefire deal in 2019, agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.",

New Zealand are a very good side but we played perfect cricket today.\n\"In such a short tournament you have to try and win every game that's in front of you. Australia have a rich history but it's about us.\"\nNew Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: \"It was a slower wicket than what we have come up against but we knew that coming in.\n\"If you had said we'd have to get 250, we'd have been happy. It spun more than we thought but their four quality spinners makes it pretty tough.\"\nFormer New Zealand wicketkeeper Katey Martin on BBC Test Match Special: \"New Zealand looked clueless against the spin and it was a challenging innings for Kane Williamson.\n\"It felt like they never got out of gear.

But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. \nMs McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \n\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. \nThe impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.\nBut analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.\nChina has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.  \nTrump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims.

The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south. \nAdditional reporting by Kevin Church.",

The pressure is back on Chelsea. All Manchester United can do is win the games they have.\"\nGoalkeeper Mary Earps, captain Katie Zelem and top scorer Nikita Parris were among the regular starters to leave the club last summer, yet United look stronger for it.\n\"Having seen how they played this year, the way they have adapted in games and played with different styles is what I am most impressed with,\" Williams said.\n\"We are so used to watching them play out from the back and play through the thirds. At times this season we have seen a different side to them. They haven't been shy of going long and in behind and playing in the opposition half. I have really enjoyed that about Manchester United.\"\nUnited's defensive improvement, inspired by the performances of goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and captain Maya Le Tissier, has returned 10 clean sheets in 15 games and has formed the backbone of their bid to secure a place in next season's Champions League.\n\"They have got back to what they are good at and that's defending,\" Williams said.\n\"They have conceded the least amount of goals in the WSL and that is a baseline for them. That is what got them second in the league two seasons ago.\"\nOf course, United continuing their winning run means little in the title race unless Chelsea drop more points.\nThe defending champions won their first nine games of the season, but have drawn two of their past six.\nTaking 14 points from a possible 18 hardly represents a major slip, but Bompastor's side have a tough run coming up.\nAfter facing Manchester City four times in three different competitions in the space of 12 days, Chelsea will face United at the end of April in a potential title decider.\n\"Chelsea have a real difficult run of games,\" Williams said.\n\"That will be difficult and I'm sure United will want Chelsea to drop points.\"\nUnited looked to have little chance of winning the title when a 1-0 defeat by Chelsea in November left them nine points adrift.\n\"Marc Skinner will keep convincing his team that they have got to keep their foot to the floor,\" said Rachel Brown-Finnis.\n\"They have got to try and capitalise on any slip that Chelsea might make. \n\"Chelsea are still battling for Champions League. There is going to be congestion in their calendar and not in Manchester United's. If that chance arises, they have to be in the best position to be able to jump at it.\"\nSkinner certainly isn't getting carried away, though he is confident his side can keep up their current form.\n\"Chelsea will look after Chelsea, we will look after Manchester United,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"We go game by game, we always have. I know it sounds boring and cliched but we cannot drop our idea onto anyone else apart from Sunderland next week, and then it will be Liverpool and then it will be Villa. It will be single games at a time, full focus, and if you drop it you see that teams can hurt you.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. \nMs McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \n\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. \nThe impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.\nBut analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.\nChina has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.  \nTrump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.

Certainly \"not good enough\".\nRangers are now 16 points behind Celtic with nine games remaining. They have either lost or drawn almost 38% of their league fixtures. \nFerguson looked increasingly agonised by a tepid, lacklustre display during which Motherwell took full advantage to earn a fantastic win, just their second in 61 league meetings between these sides.\nIt would be incredibly harsh to lay blame at Ferguson's feet, but the short-lived honeymoon seems over already. \nThe former Rangers captain has some serious issues to address - and quickly - as this squad looks increasingly unreliable, domestically at least.\n\"There's obviously a clear problem in terms of playing at home and that's something me as a manager and my staff and the players need to sit down and really get to the bottom of,\" Ferguson said.\nWorryingly for him, Ibrox was the one source of solace for much of this season as domestic away form deserted Rangers under Clement until late in his tenure. That home comfort has now imploded. \nSo what is the issue? \n\"There's good players here, I've seen it,\" Ferguson continued. \"Technically, very good. To play at Rangers, they need to be mentally strong. The fans demand that of you.\"\nOn this evidence, the mentality has been shredded. Experienced goalkeeper Jack Butland was culpable for the opener with a poor reaction save to allow Luke Armstrong to net the opener. His confidence looks diminished, as it does in many of his team-mates.\nThey were brutally exposed by some fine play from Motherwell for the second. \nMore concerning for Ferguson was the lack of energy throughout. It rarely felt that Rangers would go on and mount a winning comeback. \nThey cannot possibly win silverware, other than in Europe, where they face a stiff last 16 first-leg test away to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbache on Thursday. \nWill the Europa League version of this Jekyll and Hyde Rangers turn up again?\n\"Well, that's what happens when you play at Rangers,\" Ferguson explained.\n\"European football's great. It's great to be involved in. It's great financially for the club, but your bread and butter is domestic trophies. \n\"Domestically, the form has to be better. Europe's always been a bonus. It's brilliant to go and pit your wits against really good teams and really good managers and really good players, but what matters? Domestic football for me.\"\nRangers will hope that bonus of European form continues as their domestic season lies in tatters.\nIt was another painful home defeat for the home supporters, who must have hoped the familiar face of Ferguson in charge would bring short-term relief and steady the ship. It has not.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

He was told number 10 and you can see the good consequences of it.\"\nAsensio is not the only player who is flourishing since moving to Aston Villa, with Rashford appearing to be putting behind him a difficult season at Manchester United with a strong start to life in the Midlands.\nRashford had been struggling for form at Old Trafford and found himself out of the picture under Ruben Amorim.\nBut the move to Villa and playing alongside Asensio appears to bringing him back to his best.\nSince his debut on 9 February, Rashford has created more chances in all competitions than any other Premier League player (13).\nAgainst Cardiff, Rashford created six chances for Aston Villa, equalling the most he ever created in any of his 426 matches for Manchester United (six vs Wigan in January 2024).\nHe has yet to score, although given his performances so far that will surely come sooner rather than later.\n\"Aston Villa have given him a lifeline,\" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on ITV Sport. \n\"It seems to have come to an end at Manchester United. He needed to rebuild his confidence, he is 27 and has to show he has a lot to give. Villa have given him a good opportunity.\n\"Things could be very exciting here at Aston Villa with this new exciting Aston Villa forward line.\"\nWith a Champions League last-16 game at Club Brugge up next, Emery believes Asensio and Rashford maintaining their form is key to Villa achieving their ambitions this season.\n\"We need [Asensio] and we need Rashford,\" he said.\n\"We need the players who joined in the last window.

It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nButtler on 'right time for me' to leave England captaincy\nThe end came quicker than anyone expected.\nJust six months ago England coach Brendon McCullum backed Jos Buttler to the hilt despite questions over his captain's future.\nEven after defeat by Afghanistan, most thought the decision would be made after the flight home. Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.England's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'Published23 hours agoEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgeryPublished17 hours agoTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captainFind a new captainThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.Harry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.But appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.There is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.McCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. \"Fix the need for speedThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.Mark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.If, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.Wood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.That he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket.

In the end of the game he was there, then he went home, so there's not an issue there.\n\"But I told them that in Manchester United everything is important, and the perception in a big club is really important, so he's going to pay a dinner to all the team, and that's it.\n\"I think he understands. He was subbed, he was playing well and has to go off in that moment of the game. It's hard to deal with everything but they have to deal with everything.

They were also ordered to pay NZ$4.8m in reparation to the victims. \nHowever, following an appeal, the High Court ruled on Friday that the company only owned the land and were not responsible for people's safety.\nWhite Island, which is also known by its M\u0101ori name, Whakaari, is New Zealand's most active volcano and has been erupting in some form since 2011.\nIt had been showing signs of heightened unrest for weeks before the fatal December 2019 eruption, which killed almost half of the people who were on it at the time. Most were tourists, including 17 from Australia and three from the US.\nAnother 25 people were injured, with many suffering extensive burns.\nHigh Court Justice Simon Moore said on Friday that while WML licensed tours of the volcano, there was nothing in these agreements that gave the company control of what was happening on the island day to day.\nHe agreed that it was reasonable for the company to rely on tour operators, as well as emergency management and science organisations, to assess risks to safety.\nJustice Moore added that, in coming to his decision, he had not ignored the pain and grief of the families that had been affected.\n\"It is impossible not to be deeply moved and affected by the sheer scale and nature of the human loss in this case,\" he said.\nThirteen parties in total, including tour operators, were charged over the disaster. WML was the last to receive a verdict after six had pleaded guilty, while six more had their charges dismissed.\nThe case against WML was the largest action of its kind brought by New Zealand's regulator, Worksafe NZ, who said it acknowledged the High Court ruling and was considering whether to appeal. \nJames Cairney, a lawyer for James, Andrew and Peter Buttle - three brothers who own the company - said the family welcomed the decision, Radio New Zealand reported. He added that the Buttles hoped it would \"bring certainty for all landowners who grant others recreational access to their land\". \nThe Buttle family has owned Whakaari/White Island since the 1930s, when their grandfather bought it and placed it in a family trust. It is one of only a few privately owned islands in New Zealand. \nThe brothers had previously been on trial in relation to the 2019 disaster as individuals over alleged breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety legislation. Those charges were dismissed in 2023.",

Now [it] is hard but we are doing things to achieve success in the future.\"\nUnited's inconsistency puts even more focus on the two cup competitions they remain in - they face Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday - as it appears increasingly likely winning one of them is the only way they will qualify for European football next season.\nThe issues he is facing are so extensive, Amorim could be forgiven for wishing he had stuck to his initial demand not to leave Sporting until the end of the season.\nHowever, he does think dealing with so many problems has made him a more rounded coach.\n\"Better [coach] is hard to say, because I am not winning games,\" he said. \"But in three months here, I live certain things that I think make me a more complete manager.\n\"Sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow.

        "article_text": "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.\nThese are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.\nThen there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.\n\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.\nNorth Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.\nSince then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.\nBut after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.\nLast Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.\nAmong them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.\nBen Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.\n\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"\nDespite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"\nOn his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.\nFor now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.\nSet up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.\nJoe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.\nJoe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.\n\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"\nBut according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.\nCovid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.\nIt is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.\nLocal guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.\nEven Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"\nThe regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.\n\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.\nOne of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.\nThey knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"\nSuch conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.\nMike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"\nFor Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"\nBut tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.\n\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.\nOne conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.\nMortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.\nHowever, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.\nThe research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.\n\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.\nThere was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".\nThe registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.\nFrom 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.\nTo calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.\n\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"\nAlthough similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.\nResearchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.\nAt the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.\nSome academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.\nDementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.\n\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.\n\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"\nHe added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.\nOverall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.\nSo the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.\nBut the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.\n\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"\nDeath numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.\n\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.\n\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"\nThe UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.\n\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"\nCommenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.\n\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.\n\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"\nThe CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.\nThe rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.\nChanges to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",
