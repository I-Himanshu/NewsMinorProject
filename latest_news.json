        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

        "article_text": "Sainz (right) joined Williams after he lost his seat at Ferrari to Lewis Hamilton\nWilliams drivers Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon say it is wrong to threaten Formula 1 drivers with bans for swearing.\nSainz, who has moved to Williams from Ferrari, said he did not agree with the move by governing body the FIA to codify a system that can mean drivers are fined or suspended for swearing or criticising officials.\nAlbon, who is entering his fourth season with the team, added that the drivers had already spoken privately about how to respond to the move.\n\"There have definitely been discussions about it,\" Albon said. \"It's still ongoing about how we want to set out what we say around it. It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings. They already tell us what to say on the radio.\n\"But when you hear that passion, those words, even if sometimes we swear on the radio, for me that's a keeper in F1 and it is something we shouldn't get rid of.\"\nThe FIA has not explained how the new system will be applied, but last year president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said he wanted to stop drivers swearing while driving.\nSainz said the drivers have not had any clarification from the FIA.\nHe and Albon both drove Williams' new 2025 car as it was unveiled at Silverstone on Friday.\nVerstappen restricts answers after 'ridiculous' swearing punishment\nFerrari's Leclerc fined for swearing in news conference\nF1 drivers ask FIA to treat them like adults\nSainz explained that his first impressions were \"positive\", and he said Williams' willingness to host a day for media and sponsors and give the car its debut at the same time was indicative of the progress the team had made.\nLast year, the team struggled at the start of the season as attempts to introduce new processes in the team delayed the car build. A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

        "article_text": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues. \nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model. They've got some outstanding young German coaches. We have one coaching our national team, which is fantastic.\n\"What you see - and this is over the last 10 years - is that they have younger coaches who have been given opportunities in the Bundesliga.\n\"They've been more exposed to that level earlier, so maybe that's something we can look at. But, for me, it's not about the nationality of a manager, it's about the qualities that they bring.\"\nWith just 20 managerial spots available does the Premier League feel a bit of a closed shop?\n\"Sometimes,\" says Still. \"But it's difficult to sort of have a grasp or a proper sense of what the reality is.\n\"I don't know what those Premier League clubs are thinking. I don't know how they're working. I don't know what their next step in their recruitment process is.\n\"It's the best league in the world for a reason so you've got to be one of the best in the world and that's what I think we all aspire to do.\"\nRosenior sees it somewhat differently.\n\"I think it depends on what your ultimate goal is,\" he says. \"My ultimate goal isn't to be in the Premier League.\n\"I don't think football is a linear thing where you say, 'Right, I worked in the Championship, I'm going to go to the Premier League'.\n\"My ultimate goal is to be the best coach I can be and it's up to the decision makers at each football club to pick who they think the right coach is for their club.\"\nThere was a time when few British players ventured overseas, but the numbers are growing season upon season. Should British coaches seek to do similar?\n\"I think it's a great experience,\" says Still \"I think learning about different cultures, different ways of playing the game, different opposition, different players. I'd definitely encourage it because you open yourself up to a lot more.\"\nRosenior adds: \"It's not for me to say to anyone where they should take their careers. And it's not about nationality. It's just about being the best person you can be and working as hard as you can every day.\"\nBoth Rosenior and Still have worked exceptionally hard to get to where they are right now in their careers and the decisions they have made have set them on a collision course which will culminate, temporarily at least, at Lens' Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Sunday.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

The tribunal states that whether its decision has any benefit to the club, therefore, depends on whether the new APT rules are found to be lawful as part of the second challenge issued by the club last month. \n\"The League continues to believe that the new APT Rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter.\n\"The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to the Premier League for fair market value assessment.\"\nAPTs are commercial deals involving clubs and companies to which they have close ties. Restrictions on fair market values (FMVs) were introduced in December 2021, shortly after a Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle.\nThe Premier League has the right to assess the value of such deals to ensure they have not been inflated, which could give clubs more to spend under current financial rules.\nLast year, a tribunal ruled that low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the APTs. It also ruled that changes made to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\nFollowing the ruling, City criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion the regulations could be swiftly amended and said there should be no vote on changes before a further determination by the panel.\nHowever, in November, the Premier League voted through the amendments.\nThe Premier League said the rule changes related to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\nEarlier this month, City launched a fresh legal challenge, claiming the amendments are \"unlawful\".\nThe Premier League has already had to spend tens of millions of pounds on legal bills due to a range of recent disputes over its financial regulations. \nNow it faces the threat of further costs after a significant defeat that could lead to some clubs seeking compensation for what some sources believe could be dozens of commercial deals undervalued or rejected as a result of rules that have now been deemed to be unenforceable.\nWhile City feel vindicated by this ruling, the league's governance and ability to uphold its rulebook will now come under renewed scrutiny. But it could get worse for those in charge of the top-flight.\nIf the same arbitration panel decides that the amended set of rules are also void, the league could face a crisis.\nThere could be little preventing clubs like Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City and Saudi-owned Newcastle United from signing more lucrative deals with state-linked companies. While such clubs would welcome less restrictions on sponsorships and loans with 'associated parties', some rivals fear the league's competitive balance would be on the line.\nEnglish football is already braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the Premier League's separate disciplinary case against City.\nThe champions, who are facing 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches, deny any wrongdoing.\nBut the next few weeks could now feature another legal decision that also has a profound impact on the league's future direction.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women.

        "summary": "India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died9 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, London\u2022@geetapandeybbcGetty ImagesIndia is among a few dozen countries that do not recognise marital rapeWarning: This report contains some disturbing detailsAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.The lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". \"Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.The British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.India government says criminalising marital rape 'excessively harsh'In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriageThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. \"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. \"The court documents make for grim reading.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.Getty ImagesA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to criminalise marital rapeThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".",

The tribunal states that whether its decision has any benefit to the club, therefore, depends on whether the new APT rules are found to be lawful as part of the second challenge issued by the club last month. \n\"The League continues to believe that the new APT Rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter.\n\"The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to the Premier League for fair market value assessment.\"\nAPTs are commercial deals involving clubs and companies to which they have close ties. Restrictions on fair market values (FMVs) were introduced in December 2021, shortly after a Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle.\nThe Premier League has the right to assess the value of such deals to ensure they have not been inflated, which could give clubs more to spend under current financial rules.\nLast year, a tribunal ruled that low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the APTs. It also ruled that changes made to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\nFollowing the ruling, City criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion the regulations could be swiftly amended and said there should be no vote on changes before a further determination by the panel.\nHowever, in November, the Premier League voted through the amendments.\nThe Premier League said the rule changes related to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\nEarlier this month, City launched a fresh legal challenge, claiming the amendments are \"unlawful\".\nThe Premier League has already had to spend tens of millions of pounds on legal bills due to a range of recent disputes over its financial regulations. \nNow it faces the threat of further costs after a significant defeat that could lead to some clubs seeking compensation for what some sources believe could be dozens of commercial deals undervalued or rejected as a result of rules that have now been deemed to be unenforceable.\nWhile City feel vindicated by this ruling, the league's governance and ability to uphold its rulebook will now come under renewed scrutiny. But it could get worse for those in charge of the top-flight.\nIf the same arbitration panel decides that the amended set of rules are also void, the league could face a crisis.\nThere could be little preventing clubs like Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City and Saudi-owned Newcastle United from signing more lucrative deals with state-linked companies. While such clubs would welcome less restrictions on sponsorships and loans with 'associated parties', some rivals fear the league's competitive balance would be on the line.\nEnglish football is already braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the Premier League's separate disciplinary case against City.\nThe champions, who are facing 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches, deny any wrongdoing.\nBut the next few weeks could now feature another legal decision that also has a profound impact on the league's future direction.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify.

He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "Becoming Led Zeppelin is a new authorised documentary that tells the \"untold story\" of the band, who despite achieving global influence and legendary status, are difficult to define.\nRock's mightiest anthems, and the tales surrounding them, tend to be continually replayed \u2013 and sometimes, their power fades over time. Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

If untreated, it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis C cause inflammation of the liver and come from viral infections, according to the NHS. Both can be contracted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.  \nOpt-out testing for blood-borne viruses has been seen by health officials and ministers as a resounding success for the NHS, which has not yet released the names of the latest hospitals added to the scheme.\nThe BBC understands health leaders hope to expand opt-out testing to detect more diseases in the future. \nSean Connaughton, from London, told the BBC he would \"have been dead\" had it not been for the opt-out testing. \nHe is one of the hundreds of people to discover they were living with HIV after being diagnosed through the scheme.\nHe attended hospital in October 2023 after suffering from seizures and losing 20kg (44lbs) through repeated sickness.\n\"Unless I had gone to A&E and I had done that test, my diagnosis would never have been known,\" Mr Connaughton said.\nWithout a diagnosis, doctors told him \"some of the other infections I had would have gone into my spine and into my brain\", he told the BBC.\n\"Two days prior to being admitted, I'd had a seizure in the bathroom and smashed my head into the basin and passed out, so the body was already breaking at that point. \n\"I wouldn't have survived, I don't think, another couple of weeks, if I hadn't been tested.\"\nRichard Angell, the chief executive of sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said opt-out testing was a \"win-win for everyone\".\n\"The benefit of opt-out testing is that you can get a test to people that would otherwise never come forward for a HIV test,\" Mr Angell said.\nHe added \"that means a transformation for the individual\" who can begin to take medication, which \"means the virus is no longer attacking their immune system and they can't pass it on if they're having sex or having a baby\".\nMr Angell said early testing also makes \"good money sense for the NHS\" as it allows early treatment, which stops HIV progressing, preventing severe illness, emergency visits and more costly treatments.\nThe testing forms part of a pledge by Sir Keir Starmer to eliminate new transmissions of HIV by 2030.\nEarlier this week, Sir Keir became the first sitting prime minister to publicly take an HIV test.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents.\nThe choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; \u00a3105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad.\n\"I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,\" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. \"But I've ended up with a bounty!\"\nChloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago.\nIn 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels.\nHer protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the caf\u00e9 in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest.\nHong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her \u2013 in which she is aged 11.\n\"It freaked me out at first,\" she says, but then she fired back a public response.\n\"I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them.\"\nChloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997.\n\"Politics were never in my life before\u2026 so I went to the first protest with curiosity,\" she said.\nShe saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck.\n\"I was so shocked,\" she says. \"That moment actually changed how I looked at the world.\"\nGrowing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms \u2013 she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about \"what we like and don't like\" and  \"could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like\".\nBut the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge.\n\"I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],\" she says. But when things started to get \"really crazy\",  she browbeat her parents into coming with her.\nAt the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the \"raw experience\", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV.\nAfter months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. Suddenly, most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies \u2013 were gone.\nSymbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail.\nIn response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown.\nAt first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around.\nUnable to afford international student fees of more than \u00a320,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO.\nWhen China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target.\nHer inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas.\nThe bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK, she says.\nChina has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week. \nAnother Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors.\nAnd last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances.\n\"They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,\" Chloe says.\nShe says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong.\n\"Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,\" she says. \"It's sad but we can't blame them.\"\nOn the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate \"any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas\". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK.\nBut more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster.\nIn the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: \"We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK.\" \nBut she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers.\n\"We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China.\"\nDoes she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says. \n\"When I think of what [they] face\u2026 it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas.\"\nBounty targets",

        "article_text": "Cole Palmer started as a false nine against Brighton, but struggled to influence the game\nBefore Friday's Premier League game against Brighton, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said they \"need to find something different\" without a genuine centre-forward currently available.\nAfter being thumped 3-0 while failing to muster a shot on target, presumably the Italian is still searching.\nDespite spending more than \u00a31.5bn since the Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly takeover went through less than three years ago, a recent injury crisis has left Chelsea's squad looking remarkably threadbare - none more so than up front.\nHow have they ended up with no fit strikers to call upon and how do they solve their problems in attack?\nChelsea have signed a lot of attacking players since the takeover.\nThe Blues have forked out \u00a3445m on forwards - but aside from a now-injured Nicolas Jackson none have proved to be a high-quality number nine.\nPierre Emerick Aubameyang was signed for former manager Thomas Tuchel at a cost of \u00a312m from Barcelona, but the veteran was frozen out soon after the German was sacked following a 100-day review from the ownership without a chance to prove his worth. He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer.

Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".That all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.Latest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022How has Maresca tried to solve the problem?Maresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.The France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.He opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.But the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.As a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.They completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.Speaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. \"Related topicsChelseaPremier LeagueFootball \"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.",

        "article_text": "Cologne are top of the German second division after winning their past three league games\n\"It's chaos,\" says German football journalist Mark Lovell, when asked to describe the 2. Bundesliga title race this season - and he is right.\nWith 13 games remaining in this campaign, the battle for the two automatic promotion places - plus the single play-off spot against the 16th-placed Bundesliga side - in the German second tier is the most engrossing race in European football this season.\nJust six points separate the top six after 21 matches, with 10 points between the top 10 in the 18-team league. Seven sides have led the division and more than a quarter of games have ended in draws.\nThe clubs involved come from every walk of German football life too. \nCurrent leaders Cologne are Bundesliga regulars who suffered relegation last season, and have defied a two-window transfer ban which ended in January to achieve their lofty rank.\nThe top 10 of the 2. Bundesliga table after 21 games\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nCologne sit two points ahead of former European Cup winners Hamburg, spending their seventh-straight season in 2. Bundesliga having previously never been relegated from the top flight, and four-time national champions Kaiserslautern.\nFor Kaiserslautern, this season is the latest step in a remarkable recent history which saw them fall into the third tier in 2018 for four years amid financial hardship, before a recent recovery and even reaching the German Cup final last season.\n\"They just barely scraped by one year and right now they're on the rebound,\" George Brown, founder of the American Kaiserslautern Fan Club, tells BBC Sport.\n\"Kaiserslautern has a population of just under 100,000. Towns of this size in Germany normally have a stadium of about 12,000 [but] they have a stadium of almost 50,000. They believe that their place is up at the top level in the Bundesliga.\"\nA further three points back are Magdeburg, the only side from the old East Germany to win a European trophy \u2013 the 1974 Cup Winners' Cup \u2013 but who have never played in the Bundesliga.\nMost remarkably of all, all nine of their league wins this season have come in away games, their 10 home matches delivering seven draws and three defeats.\nThere are other contenders too. Fortuna Dusseldorf, who missed out on promotion last season after throwing away a three-goal lead in the play-off, have led the league for longer than any other side and sit fifth. Just below are recognisable names like Hannover and Nuremberg, not forgetting SV Elversberg who are spending just their second season at this level \u2013 yet led the division as late as matchday 16.\nMagdeburg are in promotion contention after winning nine of their 11 away league games this season\nAnd for the final ingredient, add an average attendance of more than 30,000 fans per game. This is boosted by huge crowds at former Champions League sides Hertha Berlin and Schalke, though they are 13th and 14th respectively, and more concerned about relegation.\nSo yes, it's chaos \u2013 but why is it so close?\nAccording to Lovell, a key factor is money \u2013 but unlike its English counterpart it is  a lack thereof, rather than an imbalanced abundance.\n\"It's not distorted like the Championship is with these parachute payments coming down, Premier League clubs being rewarded for failure with these huge lumps of cash,\" he says.\n\"In German football, they do have a better TV deal then they've had historically but it is nothing like the Championship. It is quite a struggle to get back immediately to the top flight.\n\"Look at Hamburg. Former European champions, Kevin Keegan [as a former player], they were the reason I got interested in German football, they were historically one of the biggest clubs in Germany and very proud of their record of never being relegated from the top flight. \n\"They were termed the dinosaur because they were never going to get relegated but that fate happened and they haven't been able to get back.\"\nRobert Stokowy, a former Cologne native who is now part of the FC Cologne Supporters USA group, says this title race is the result of smaller, well-run clubs colliding with monoliths experiencing tougher times.\n\"There's pressure from below, and there's pressure from the first division,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"Cologne are an elevator team. Last season we just got beaten badly, and if you look at the Bundesliga right now you have such a discrepancy between how much money teams have, and there's just no way that that is a healthy and interesting competition.\n\"What we have [in 2.Bundesliga] is a couple more investors, so some of the clubs from the third division get picked up and all of a sudden they get elevated \u2013 look at the rise of Heidenheim and Union Berlin.\n\"I think the second division is the sweet spot because there is some TV revenue, there's an interesting mix of clubs from the first division who had glory days back then, and you have the ones who come up from the lower leagues.\n\"It is an example of what you can do if you run your club well.\"\nHamburg spent 55 straight seasons in the Bundesliga before their current seven-year stint in the second division\nThat excitement has drawn in the spectators and Marco Fuchs and Maike Baensch, chair and deputy of The Supporters Karlsruhe, say membership has tripled.\nKarlsruhe however are one of the victims of such a fickle league as a run of four winless games has sent them tumbling from second to 10th.\n\"It's a difficult situation,\" says Baensch. \"You want people to be engaged in the league, enjoying every game but at the same time it's frustrating and demoralising to think that you're right up there and then all of a sudden you're back in mid table.\"\nNo fan or club, Brown says, can be confident in predicting what the season will hold in the final 13 matches. \n\"All the conversations that I've seen are incredibly cautious,\" he says. \"One of the things that everybody always says is you don't ever talk about a promotion until you get 40 points. The theory is no team has ever been relegated that had 40 points or more.\n\"But it certainly has made every single match incredible. It doesn't matter if you're the home or away team, it doesn't matter if you're playing the last place team or the first. You have no idea what you're going to get and that just builds excitement and drives people to the stadium.\n\"I wouldn't advise people to gamble on this league because you just never know what's going to happen,\" adds Lovell. \"Top can beat bottom, and just because you were in the Bundesliga last season doesn't guarantee anything.\"",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "article_text": "BBC's Discovering the World's Table sees food writer Nick Kwek journey to his ancestral homeland of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo, where he eats pufferfish with the Bajau Laut sea nomads, learns the art of rice wine-making and is given a secret hangover cure.\nPristine turquoise waves lap our boat as we depart the harbourfront in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah's busy state capital, and sail towards a jungle oasis. But it's not an island paradise we're heading for \u2013 in fact we're not touching foot on land at all. Instead, we're destined for a cluster of stilted shacks perched above the water's surface some 7km from the shore. The settlement is home to the Bajau Laut, a nomadic community who live most of their lives at sea.\u00a0\u00a0\nWho better to kickstart my culinary adventure around Sabah with than the Bajau, who eat Malaysia's spectacular seafood for breakfast, lunch and dinner? But first we'll need to catch it. As renowned hunters, they follow the fish, dismantling and rebuilding their makeshift houses as they go, expertly freediving and spearfishing their prey with seemingly supernatural skill.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"They can erect them in as fast as a day,\" says local tour guide, Emily Chin, who has been working with the Bajau and other Indigenous groups for years. \"They're so connected with the sea that they often don't know what to do if they're not on the sea \u2013 it's almost like a third arm for them.\"\nIndeed, their bodies have evolved over the years giving them extra-large spleens that act like a biological \"scuba tank\", allowing them to hold their breath for up to 10 minutes at a time. Meanwhile, my breath has been taken away.\nMeet the expert:\nNick\u00a0Kwek\u00a0is a food writer, presenter and filmmaker who has travelled the world documenting stories for BBC series including Discovering The World's Table, The Travel Show and Click. He's reported for BBC News, ABC and SBS and contributed to leading food and drink publications.\nKwek\u00a0grew up into a family of chefs and bakers, before working in some of Scotland's best bars and restaurants.\nThis is my first time back in my father's homeland, Sabah, in almost two decades. Born and raised in Fife, Scotland, I grew up in my parent's pan-Asian restaurant, surrounded by the billowing smoke of red-hot woks, scorching chilli and fragrant ginger. The exotic flavours and enchanting ingredients of my childhood inspired my passion for food and an insatiable appetite for travel.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo be returning here to discover more about Sabah's traditional dishes, explore its local ingredients and their heritage is an emotional, fantastical experience.\u00a0\nKwek is a Chinese surname, with my father's side part of Malaysia's largest ethnic minority \u2013 the Chinese-Malay community. They live alongside Malays, Indians and Indigenous groups that make up the melting pot that is Malaysia. And it's this uniquely rich cultural diversity that makes for a very special cuisine, bursting with bold, lasting flavours.\nToday\u2019s menu is no different \u2013 the Bajau are treating me to freshly-caught pufferfish, notoriously poisonous if not prepared correctly and usually served on special occasions such as weddings or family reunions. It's boiled with chilli, garlic, turmeric and fresh calamansi juice, a native citrus with the appearance and sourness of a miniature lime but with the sweet zing of clementine orange. The dish is both hot and tangy, with the fish unexpectedly meaty, reminiscent of monkfish.\u00a0\nWhilst cooking, Chin introduces me to a delicacy adored by the Bajau: latok, a type of seaweed, normally eaten raw. Glistening green globes, these mini bunches of \"sea grapes\" pop on your tongue, releasing a salty, juicy, refreshing essence of the sea. This so-called green caviar is gaining popularity across Southeast Asia as a healthy and nutritious snack.\u00a0\nBack on dry land, it's an ingredient celebrated by chef Raphael Lee, of high-end eatery OITOM in downtown Kota Kinabalu. Originally from Sabah, he moved to Melbourne, Australia, to train in refined cooking techniques before returning to introduce a new fine dining concept to the city, catering to its burgeoning middle class and international visitors.\n\"Oitom means 'black' in Kadazan-Dusun [the language of Sabah's largest ethnic group]\", Lee tells me. \"We are championing heritage cuisines through the lens of the culinary world.\" Named in honour of Lee's heritage, the restaurant has a dark-black interior that acts as a stage so his colourful plates can shine.\nToday we're preparing a raw white fish salad called hinava, a traditional cured dish of the Kadazan-Dusun tribes. Akin to ceviche, it comprises grouper, fresh chilli, ginger, shallots, calamansi juice and bambangan (an indigenous wild mango). But Lee's modern take on the classic dish involves homemade kombucha, strawberries foraged from the foothills of Mount Kinabalu and latok.\u00a0\n\"We have around 33 tribes in Borneo and each prepares their hinava differently. Some use vinegar, some use bambangan seed. Food is all about cross-culture, and of course whilst we want to treasure the authenticity of our cuisine, for its growth, it needs innovation as well,\" he says.\nLee's version is delicately presented, with each element tweezered into place and the taste\u00a0is softer, smoother and more complex than the original.\nSeafood is undeniably the star of the show in Sabah. Coastal towns sprawl with fish markets, while restaurants and food courts have tanks teaming with live, freshly caught grouper, crabs, lobsters, prawns and clams. These ingredients play a leading role in the country's signature specialities like the lusciously spicy curry laksa, char kway teoh (a gloriously fatty fried noodle mix) and the iconic butter prawns \u2013 delightfully crispy yet wondrously creamy, served in the shell.\u00a0\nBut as well as sublime seafood surrounding the huge island of Borneo (the third largest island in the world at around 290,000 sq km), inland is another staple of the modern Malaysian diet: rice.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Mandy Yin's Sarawak white chicken\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nPopularised with the arrival of migrants from China, India, Sumatra and Thailand during British colonialism in the 19th Century, rice takes centre stage for the country's national dish, nasi lemak. A meal made of several parts but almost always coconut rice, boiled eggs, cucumber, sambal sauce and tiny dried fish known as \"bilis\". (Try it with beef rendang \u2013 a dry lemongrass and coconut stew \u00ad\u2013 you won't regret it.)\nTwo hours' drive over the hills into the mountain valley of Keningau belies a sea of green fields \u2013 \u00a0pastures of rice paddies as far as the eye can see. Out in the blistering Sun I meet village chief Mami Ita whose family has been growing rice here and making traditional tapai (rice wine) for generations. She welcomes me to her home where she teaches me how it's made.\nWe start by building a fire and boiling rice that's leftover from last year's harvest and has had time to sufficiently harden. \"It's a family activity,\" she tells me, something sacred to bond over. In addition to love, the secret ingredient here is ragi, a yeast formed by hand. The caressing of the yeast helps form its unique flavour profile as the scent and spirit of its handler becomes solidified within. Each family's brew produces its own distinct taste.\n\"You don't touch chilli or lemon for two weeks before handling the ragi,\" warns Mami Ita, whose yeast starter used today was her grandmother's.\nInstead of a wooden barrel, the wine is matured inside a clay pot known as a tajau, but it's left to age without water. Only upon opening a tajau several months later is water added and the newly infused wine ready to drink. Before I sip, Mami Ita lets me in on a secret ritual to keep the hangover demons at bay.\n\"Place your finger into the wine, then touch it against your forehead and then into your belly button and say \"Tuka Tuka!\" To my disbelief, it worked!\u00a0\nTapai is having a moment in Borneo. It's being reimagined at Limau & Linen, a contemporary restaurant and lounge in Kota Kinabalu's upmarket Signal Hill neighbourhood, where proprietor and executive chef Linn Yong mixes rice wine with coconut syrup and pineapple juice before garnishing the cocktail with local mountain flowers.\u00a0\nYong is keen to convey that Malaysia's cuisine is a reflection of its people. She's crafted a dish that honours her nation's diversity yet togetherness: the \"tajau treasure community pie\". A confit of smoked octopus, scallops and shrimp, rice, rice wine and fish stock\u00a0are combined in a tajau and topped with a puff pastry lid. It's a celebration of Sabah's bounty, intended to be enjoyed together.\n\"Behind every restaurant is a community of farmers and customers. For me it's like breaking bread with the people we love,\" says Yong.\u00a0\nAs the pie reaches the table and Yong makes a speech about her creation's genesis, steam rises up around us, filling the room with a warm comforting aroma that brings me home. A befitting finale to our journey of discovery, reconnection and the indelible impact of cultural traditions.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.",

The workers were mainly Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek.The charity wants a review of the seasonal agricultural worker scheme and of any risks of exploitation it presents.A Home Office spokeswoman said its staff had visited 318 farms and carried out more than 2,100 worker interviews, with improvements made every year to stop exploitation and poor working conditions. \"We will always take decisive action where we believe abusive practices are taking place or the conditions of the route are not met,\" she added.The National Farmers' Union said overseas workers were \"invaluable\" to British farmers, who \"take employee welfare extremely seriously and are continually adapting the way they operate to provide the best experience for workers\".A spokeswoman added that the vast majority of workers have \"a good experience in the UK which results in many returning to the same farms season after season\".UK fruit picking like prison, says migrant workerScience & EnvironmentUK farming \"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.",

        "article_text": "The \"very slow-burn\" new series of the satire about a luxury resort is uneven and disappointing.\nLook closely at the opening credit sequence of this season's White Lotus, set at a luxury resort on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand. The camera roves over colourful drawings depicting centuries-old scenes of the landscape and culture, but soon the images of Buddhist shrines and elephants amidst flowered greenery give way to angry monkeys and shipwrecked men being eaten by sea creatures.\nThat ominous pattern reflects the plots of every season of The White Lotus. But unlike the credit sequence and the previous two instalments, the rest of this very slow-burn season doesn't get to the danger nearly fast or vividly enough. A series should never move so slowly that it only begins to take off halfway through. The White Lotus still has writer and director Mike White's fingerprints, and occasionally his iconoclasm and inventiveness. But this uneven iteration feels flabby and elongated, with far less satiric bite.\nAs before, this season starts with an unidentified corpse, after gunshots interrupt a meditation session with the resort's so-called \"health mentor\". So much for the Eastern spiritual calm some of the rich Western travellers might have hoped for. The story then flashes back a week as the guests arrive.\nThe show always skewers the ultrarich while heading toward the murder, so it makes sense that the most intriguing characters are a wealthy financial advisor and his family, even though the jabs at their privilege are toothless. Tim Ratliff finds himself in serious, predictable business trouble back home, but Jason Isaacs makes the character's desperation visceral and urgent. His wife, Victoria (Parker Posey), is a one-note character always zonked out on anti-anxiety drugs.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Instagram wellness guru who faked cancer\n\u2022\u00a011 of the best TV shows to watch this February\n\u2022\u00a0In an age of distrust spy thrillers are booming\nWhite's astute casting often makes the season better than the story suggests, though, and the Ratliff children are especially well played. The middle child, earnest Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), has led the family to Thailand so she can research her college thesis on Buddhism, one of the few plot points that actually has to do with Thailand. The oldest son, Saxon, is a good-looking, sex-obsessed dolt. Patrick Schwarzenegger effectively channels the layers of this bro-guy whose hedonism comes back to bite him. Sam Nivola plays the youngest child, shy high-school senior Lochlan. If you get the unsettling sense that the sexual boundaries in this family are a little too loose, trust your instincts. White provides a twist that is both ick and proof that he hasn't entirely lost his edge or willingness to plumb some dark psychology. The Ratliff brothers' casting might seem to cry nepo-baby because Patrick is Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver's son, and Nivola's parents are Alessandro Nivola and Emily Mortimer. But both are entirely natural and convincing, worth casting on their own.\nIn another smart, unexpected choice, Walton Goggins from Fallout plays the enigmatic Rick, whose garish shirts and unkempt appearance make him out of place at the resort. He seems to be some kind of grifter with a younger, put-upon girlfriend (Aimee Lou Wood). But for once Goggins is not asked to grin wildly, and becomes poignant when Rick's ulterior motive is revealed \u2013 if you believe his story.\nAnd Natasha Rothwell returns as Belinda, the spa manager in Maui in the first season, now in Thailand for job training in wellness. Rothwell has always made the character touching, with a sweet diffident smile that signals how little she expects from life. Here she is used mostly as a plot device, but it's a clever plot full of call-backs to earlier seasons and too spoilery to detail.\u00a0\nBy far the weakest storyline involves three long-time friends on a girls' trip. Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb's roles are shockingly cliched, including jealousy, gossip and a holiday fling with the help. Near the start, Coon gulps a whole glass of wine, typical of the mugging and telegraphing of characters in a thread that is meant to be the most comic but just seems stale.\u00a0\nWith so many possibilities, it's disappointing that the show doesn't use its setting well. It just cuts away to a shot of a monkey or a statue of a monkey now and then. And although the premise is full of built-in cultural and class differences, the Thai characters are marginal and shallow. Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink, plays Mook, a member of the wellness staff who has little to do except smile and flirt with the security guard at the resort's entrance.\nSome major themes come to the fore as the eight-episode season winds down, especially when Piper visits a Buddhist monastery. But by the end of episode six, the last one sent to critics, the season is still just an echo of the previous ones. A fourth season has already been ordered, so The White Lotus has a chance to right itself, but maybe not in Thailand.\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "From raw eggs to protein shakes, those hoping to expand their brawn are often encouraged to ingest vast quantities of protein. But how much is really necessary and what's the best way to consume it?\nSophia\u00a0Moulson, 21, a fitness influencer based in West Sussex, began taking fitness seriously at the age of 19, after struggling with being overweight.\n\"I often turned to food as a source of comfort, which ultimately left me in a cycle of negative self-image and low confidence. One day, I realised that I needed to take control \u2013 not just for my physical health but for my mental wellbeing too,\" says Moulson.\nInitially, she joined the gym with the sole intention of losing weight. But over time, she fell in love with the process of building up a healthy amount of muscle too. \"I discovered how empowering it felt to grow stronger, and each small strength milestone motivated me to keep pushing forward,\" she says.\nAn integral part of Moulson's progress was research on nutrition. That's when she learned about the importance of protein for building muscle. However, as a vegetarian, Moulson initially felt that she was struggling to get enough protein through just her diet, so she turned to protein powders. \"While it was possible for me to meet my needs through a well-balanced diet, it often required time and careful planning. Protein powders offered a convenient solution, especially with my busy lifestyle,\" she says.\nWhile in the past, bodybuilders were notorious for consuming vast quantities of steak and drinking raw eggs, today, protein powders and tailored diets are big business. But do we really need so much protein to grow stronger? And what is the best way to consume it?\nLinea Patel, a\u00a0Sports Dietitian at the company Pure Sports Medicine in London, explains that proteins have many roles in the human body. As they are digested, the proteins in food are broken down into amino acids \u2013 building blocks that can be rearranged to form any protein that the body needs. Haemoglobin, enzymes, muscles, the keratin in our skin and hair \u2013 there are more than 20,000 proteins in the human body, performing a wide range of functions.\nHowever, the amount that each person needs can vary greatly, depending on their age, body composition and lifestyle.\n\"In the UK, the government guidelines say that the general baseline for sedentary adults is that they should consume 0.8 or 0.75g\u00a0[around 0.03oz] of protein per kg of their own body weight,\" says Patel. \"So, for example, if somebody weighed 70kg [154lb], then you just multiply that by 0.8 and you'll get 56g [around 2oz] of protein a day.\"\nMost people get more than that amount from their normal diets. In the US, the average American consumes around 14-16% of their total calories as protein. However, if you're more active, your protein requirements may exceed 1g per kg each day. The amount of protein you need also depends on factors such as your age, because people tend to lose muscle mass as they get older \u2013 consuming more protein can help us to hold onto more muscle. Post-menopausal women also have higher protein requirements.\n\"What I see in my clinical practice, particularly because I work with women in the menopause or high performing individuals [sportspeople], is that perhaps that they're not eating enough protein for their level of activity or to maintain [appropriate] muscle mass for their stage of life,\" says Patel. One size doesn't fit all, she explains.\nFor individuals engaging in regular high-intensity resistance training or athletes and powerlifters or body builders, research has found that the daily\u00a0protein\u00a0requirement is approximately 1.6-2.2g (0.06-0.08oz) per kg of body weight to maximise muscle\u00a0protein\u00a0synthesis.\u00a0\nMany medical professionals recommend that people acquire the protein they need from their diets, wherever possible. For vegans, this can involve consuming more nuts, seeds and soya-based products, as well as pulses such as beans and lentils. For vegetarians, eggs, yoghurt and certain types of cheese can be added, while omnivores may also want to increase their consumption of meat and seafood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor many, consuming enough protein involves experimenting with different foods. However, not everyone has the time or money to acquire adequate protein through their diet alone.\u00a0\n\"Even though, theoretically, one can meet this target through a balanced diet rich in\u00a0protein-dense foods like lean meats, eggs, dairy and legumes, for many this may not be easy without supplementation,\" says Cyriac Abby Philips, a liver specialist at the Rajagiri Hospital in Kerala, India.\nLauren Manaker a dietician based in Charleston, South Carolina in the US, adds that protein powders \"do provide a convenient and portable option, especially for individuals with busy lifestyles or limited access to whole food sources\".\nGlobally, the protein powder market has been valued at $4.4bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2021, and is expected to grow to $19.3bn (\u00a315.6bn) by 2030. There are many formulations \u2013 both animal and plant-based, in the form of shakes, or added to nutrition bars, yoghurts and ready meals.\n\"When I incorporated plant-based protein powders into my diet, it became much easier to hit my protein goals\u2026 Over time, I experimented with different options and found that lean protein powders or whey protein worked best for me, as they are low in calories but high in protein,\" says Moulson.\nHowever, protein powders can come with risks, and there's some evidence in rats that they could lead to liver damage in those who are not exercising. There have also been rare cases of toxicity to the liver from whey and soy-based protein powders in humans.\u00a0\nProtein powders can also be misleadingly labelled and may contain harmful contaminants. For a recent study, Philips and colleagues from India and the US analysed protein powders sold in India. The team found that many powders contained more or less protein than they were marketed as having \u2013 leading to concerns about \"protein-spiking\" \u2013 as well as contaminants including heavy metals, fungal toxins and herbal extracts that may be toxic to the liver.\nToxins in protein powders may be more widespread than we think.\nIn 2018, a nonprofit group called the Clean Label Project, based in Broomfield, Colorado, released a report about toxins in popular brands of protein powders in the US. Researchers screened 134 products for 130 types of toxins and found that many protein powders contained heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury), bisphenol-A (or BPA, which is used to manufacture plastic), pesticides, or other contaminants with links to cancer and other health conditions. Some toxins were present in significant quantities.\nFor example, one protein powder contained 25 times the allowed limit of BPA in the US. The pesticides and chemicals came from agricultural residue and from the packaging of these powders, researchers observed. Interestingly, one certified \"organic\" product had twice the contaminants of non-certified ones. Plant-based protein powders were the most contaminated, while egg and whey-based powders were found to be the cleanest.\nBecause protein powders are considered dietary supplements and not pharmaceuticals, regulation from governing authorities tends to be more relaxed \u2013 in the US and the UK, they're considered food. This has led to concerns that they are not being regulated strictly enough.\nWhen increasing body muscle, it's not impossible to get your protein requirements through the foods you eat, but it can take considerable time and planning. The key to achieving your daily requirements is to eat protein at every meal and to plan your meals around a principal source of protein, says Patel.\n\"We're looking to aim for at least 20-30g (0.7-1.1oz) of protein per meal,\" says Patel. That would be the equivalent to a couple of eggs or some Greek yogurt with nuts sprinkled on top, or a chicken breast, or a piece of tofu that is the size of your fist.\n\"So, for example, you might have to have two eggs on sourdough toast with some avocado with some seeds sprinkled on top \u2013 with the eggs being the principal protein, the food source with the highest protein content,\" says Patel. \"In a meal that consists of beans or lentils with some rice, the lentils would be the principal protein.\"\nIf you decide to take a protein supplement instead or as well as altering your diet, there are a few simple rules for choosing one that is least likely to contain harmful substances. First of all, prioritise high-quality\u00a0proteins with minimal additives, says Philips.\n\"One must definitely avoid 'blended'\u00a0proteins\u00a0with herbal components as the risk of adulteration, contamination inclusive of the presence of heavy metals and fungal toxins are higher in these types of\u00a0protein\u00a0supplements,\" he says.\nManaker also advises that consumers do their research, particularly to avoid unnecessary ingredients. \"Look for protein powders that contain high-quality ingredients and have minimal additives, fillers or artificial sweeteners. Opt for brands that prioritise transparency and provide detailed information about the sourcing and processing of their ingredients,\" Manaker says.\nManaker also recommends considering the source of the protein in the powder. It's important to check labels to see if it's from whey, casein, soya, plant or animal-based proteins, she says. \"Choose a protein source that aligns with your dietary preferences, allergies or sensitivities.\"\nIf you're taking a protein supplement or powder, timing can play a role in optimising its benefits, says Manaker. \"Consuming protein within 30 minutes to an hour after a workout is often recommended to take advantage of the body's heightened ability to absorb and utilise nutrients during this time,\" she says.\nAnd the way you take protein powders matters. While protein supplements can be beneficial, it's crucial to avoid relying solely on them as a source of nutrition. \"Whole, nutrient-dense foods should form the foundation of your diet, and supplements should only complement a well-balanced eating plan. Avoid the temptation to replace meals entirely with protein powders, as this can lead to an inadequate intake of other essential nutrients,\" says Manaker.\nWith widespread access to protein powders and protein-rich foods today, some people do consume more protein than what they probably need, says Manaker. For example, while the average adult needs around 45-56 grams (1.6-2 ounces) of protein per day, in the UK people tend to consume around 75-100 grams (2.6-3.5 ounces). \u00a0While it is essential for muscle building and overall health, consuming an excessive amount of protein intake can have potential risks.\n\"High protein intake over a prolonged period can put strain on the kidneys,\" says Manaker. \"Individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions should be particularly cautious.\"\nFurthermore, a sudden increase in protein intake, especially from protein powders, can sometimes lead to digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas and constipation. \"Keep an eye on the way your body reacts, even as you tweak your protein [intake],\" says Patel.\nKeep in mind that it's easy to go overboard with protein powders. \"As a general guideline, I wouldn't recommend that people using protein powders exceed 80g [2.8oz] a day,\" says Patel. \"Even 80g of protein from protein powder is excessive for most people. It's going to completely displace whole foods that provide vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that we need. So in general, for most of my clients I tell them to stick with 20 to 40g [0.7-1.4oz] of protein powder per day.\"\nIn particular, problems tend to arise when one's diet is laser-focused only on proteins, says Patel. Micronutrients from fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates, which are also vital for a balanced diet, can end up being neglected.\nIn order to optimise your diet while weight training, ensure that you're including quality carbohydrates and prioritise micro-nutrients like Vitamin D, magnesium, iron and Omega 3 fats. \"They're all essential for optimum muscle contraction, bone health and energy. Eat fruits, vegetables and include oily fish in your diet at least once a week,\" says Patel.\nGetting enough protein is key to growing stronger muscles, but it's only one of the pillars of wellness, says Patel. \"The other pillars are physical activity, getting the training right and sleeping well,\" she says.\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn \u00a320.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. The release clause can be triggered for \u00a3145m before the final year of his contract and then goes down to \u00a383m.\nJust last week, it was revealed Kane also possesses certain release clauses that can be triggered before the respective ends of the January transfer windows to initiate a move for the summer.\nAs valuable as the England captain has been in his role as Bayern's top-notch goalscorer, the 31-year-old is obviously not seen as a long-term solution for Bayern, with an eventual return to the Premier League - where Kane could eventually break Alan Shearer's goalscoring record - appearing likely.\nMeanwhile, Musiala is 10 years younger than Kane and the perfect representative for Bayern, who have always been anxious to assemble the best German players, mixed with a number of high-profile talents from abroad.\nMusiala has already created countless moments of magic for Bayern, including his championship-clinching goal against Cologne in May 2023, when the team snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund during the final minutes of the season.\nMusiala played for England's youth teams but opted to represent Germany, the country of his birth\nWhen Musiala misses games or can only play a limited number of minutes due to an injury, his absence has been felt as the team does not look the same at all.\nBayern's 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Uefa Champions League earlier this season was a prime example.\nMusiala himself has talked about how he can be almost obsessed with improving his game through repetition and specialised training, for example practising certain shooting positions and movements.\n\"I just try to do everything that can take me to the next level,\" he said in 2023. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.\n\"I try to start at a young age with nutrition, the extra work so I can have more stamina, and then season by season, hopefully I get better.\"\nThere can be no doubt he has improved, instead of just resting on his natural talent as a footballer, and can do even further to put his name high among the world's best players in the future.\nIt is the reason why Musiala has just signed the most lucrative contract extension in German Bundesliga history.\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'",

        "article_text": "Ordered by the Trump administration to drop a corruption case against New York's mayor, a top federal prosecutor instead resigned in protest.\nDanielle Sassoon is known as a tough but fair conservative attorney, according to former colleagues and courtroom rivals alike.\nIn 2016, Danielle Sassoon wrote a tribute to a former boss, the late US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. She praised the conservative jurist's character, and his legal approach. Such qualities were not universal, she told readers.\n\"Sometimes, when you peek behind the curtain of power, you suffer a rude awakening,\" she wrote. \"What you find is corruption, ego, or a lack of ideals and intellectual heft.\"\nOn Thursday, Sassoon, who had served just three weeks as the interim head of the Southern District of New York offered the country a peek behind that curtain of power.\nThe 38-year-old federal prosecutor resigned on Thursday, after refusing to comply with the Justice Department's order to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\nShe did not go quietly. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, which quickly became public, Sassoon said there was no legal justification for dismissing the case.\nShe made explosive allegations of a quid-pro-quo proposed by Adams' attorneys to the justice department, and said that the top official who ordered them to stop, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, had not provided sufficient legal justification for his actions.\nAdams and his attorney, Alex Spiro, have denied Sassoon's allegation. Trump himself has denied political meddling in the criminal case.\nIn her resignation letter, Sassoon wrote: \"Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations.\"\nSassoon's resignation has sparked the most public upheaval of the criminal justice system since Donald Trump took office in January. \nSix prosecutors at the justice department's criminal and public integrity unit, including its interim leaders Kevin Driscoll and John Keller, resigned as well, CBS News, BBC News' US media partner, reported. \nHagan Scotten, another federal prosecutor, wrote in his own resignation letter that he was \"entirely in agreement\" with Sassoon's decision not to drop the Adams case.\nThose who worked with Sassoon say they are not surprised she took this extraordinary stance.\nCarrie Cohen, a former colleague at the Southern District of New York, described her as \"an excellent, diligent, tough, but fair prosecutor, exactly the type of prosecutor that people should want serving their country\".\nOn Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James lauded Sassoon as a \"profile in courage\".\nEven those who worked against Sassoon's team of prosecutors in court praised her decision.\nSassoon and her team were \"fierce advocates for the office\", said criminal defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman.\n\"While I didn't always see eye to eye with them, they were fair and just,\" he said. \nIn a Fox News appearance on Friday morning, Mayor Adams called Sassoon's allegations \"silly\" and said she was accusing him of \"a crime\".\nMr Spiro called her accusations a \"lie\".\n\"We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,\" he told CBS News.\nSassoon began her legal career at Yale Law School, where she served as a features editor for the prestigious Yale Law Journal. \nIn 2013, she went to London on a Temple Bar Scholarship, where she shadowed barristers and learned the differences between the US and UK justice systems, according to an essay she wrote about her experience abroad.\nShe also served as a foreign law clerk to Justice Hanan Melcer of the Israel Supreme Court in 2009.\nSassoon won prestigious clerkships with well known conservative jurists: Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III  of the fourth circuit court of appeals, and later Scalia, perhaps the most high-profile member of the US Supreme Court at the time.\nScalia \"taught me how to fire a pistol and a rifle, and made me feel like I had grit\", Sassoon wrote in her 2016 memorial for Scotus blog. \"He thickened my skin, which was the best preparation for a career in a male-dominated field.\"\nIn her letter to the US attorney general this week, Sassoon highlighted her work for these conservatives, potentially heading off allegations that she defied the justice department for partisan reasons.\n\"Both men instilled in me a sense of duty to contribute to the public good and up hold the rule of law, and a commitment to reasoned and thorough analysis,\" she wrote to Bondi.\nSassoon joined the Southern District of New York in 2016 after stints at a white collar firm and on the faculty at New York University Law School. She is a member of the Federalist Society, a professional group of conservative lawyers and scholars.\nShe prosecuted the fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, which resulted in a guilty verdict and a sentence of 25 years in prison.\n\"There was an abundance of evidence in that case and the outcome was expected by all, but it was complex and the prosecutors were very professional, organized and cogent,\" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School who followed the case closely.\nDespite her work on such high profile cases, Sassoon kept a low profile, as is typical for federal prosecutors.\nShe was temporarily leading the Southern District of New York, while Trump's choice for the top job, Jay Clayton, awaited US Senate confirmation. \nWith her conservative bona fides, she could have potentially found work in the new Republican administration.\nBut then came Bove's instruction to drop the corruption case against Adams, who was accused of accepting bribes and improper campaign contributions from foreign nationals. \nAdams has denied the claims and pleaded not guilty. His trial was set for April.\nSassoon's decision to defy orders, and reveal secretive justice department discussions on her way out the door, was extremely unusual, Manhattan attorneys said.\n\"This is the stuff you never see,\" said Arthur Aidala, a criminal defence attorney.\nThe justice department could still take retaliatory measures. \nIn his response to Sassoon, Bove wrote that he was putting assistant US attorneys involved in the Adams case on leave pending an investigation. He also said the justice department would \"evaluate your conduct\".\nBut New York lawyers say that Sassoon's act of defiance may have sprung from necessity as much as conviction.\n\"Both from a moral perspective and a practical perspective she had no choice,\" said Mark Zauderer, a high-profile appellate attorney. \"The office would have been in shambles.\"\nTo comply with Bove could have prompted a staff exodus and put the office's reputation at risk, he said.\nMs Cohen, who still considered Sassoon a friend, said she recalled the prosecutor as a staunch advocate for her colleagues.\n\"You can see that support in her decision to put the office, and her oath of office, at the forefront of her decision to resign,\" Ms Cohen said.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMan City's Egyptian Prince - Lineker on Marmoush\nThere is not much Erling Haaland has failed to do when it comes to scoring goals since he joined Manchester City.\nFifty-two overall in his first season, including 36 in the Premier League, the most anyone has scored in a single campaign.\nThirty-eight in his second, despite being injured for almost two months, and 27 so far this term.\nThat incredible haul has secured the Norwegian two Golden Boots and an incredible 11 hat-tricks. \nYet none of those trebles came quicker than the 13 minutes and 54 seconds Omar Marmoush took to get his first City hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Newcastle.\nAfter four games without scoring since his \u00a359m winter transfer window move from German side Eintracht Frankfurt, it was an impressive and well-timed surge in form given City go to Real Madrid for their crucial Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday with a one-goal deficit to overcome after a 3-2 loss at home. \nIt was also the first time any City player other than Haaland had scored three times in a game since Phil Foden did it at Brentford just over a year ago.\nAnd that is the point.\nOne of the notable features of the terrible mid-season run of one win in 13 games, which wrecked any chance City had of extending their record run of four successive titles - and was mainly responsible for them ending up having to face Real Madrid so early in the Champions League - was the fact hardly anyone picked up the slack when Haaland's form dipped.\nJosko Gvardiol, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva all scored two goals in that time. But other than Haaland, who got four, no-one scored more.\nMarmoush hits quickfire treble as Man City thrash Newcastle\nOmar Marmoush had scored 20 goals in all competitions for Eintracht Frankfurt this term, when he joined Manchester City\nIt is that issue Guardiola was trying to address when he called contacts in Germany to check up on Marmoush after sporting director Txiki Begiristain had put the Egyptian's name forward as a part of City's overall \u00a3180m January transfer window spend.\n\"When Txiki came to me I said, because of the season we had, the more players you bring the better,\" said Guardiola.\n\"I called some contacts in Germany because I have friends there. I asked a few things and there was a high opinion in many things; behaviour, in training sessions, goals.\n\"He's young and comes here to make his career. That is why the club decides. They always have the last word.\"\nMarmoush had already demanded attention through the 20 goals he scored for Eintracht in the first half of this season.\nAt 26, City were buying someone approaching the prime of their career.\nOn the evidence of his performance against Newcastle, Marmoush drives forward with purpose when the ball is at his feet, is quick and can find space. \nEvidently he presents a danger opposition defences cannot ignore \u2013 and Newcastle could not contain.\nThat, in turn, may take some of the focus away from Haaland.\n\"Everything about his game was impressive,\" former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day. \n\"Already he has a good understanding with Haaland. Newcastle couldn't live with him.\"\n\"We knew with the dynamic he would be good,\" added Guardiola. \"In Germany he made good numbers and he had three chances last week against [Leyton] Orient but didn't score.\n\"He likes to attack the space. It is simple. When you play well, everybody adapts quick. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments because they will come now.\"\nIt was one of those rare occasions when Haaland didn't score and contributed a single assist, for James McAtee, six minutes from time.\nYet his industry was notable, leading from the front in a performance befitting his status as captain for the first time.\nNormally, Guardiola stays out of the captaincy issue, preferring to let the players decide on the leadership group.\nHowever, with club skipper Kyle Walker now at AC Milan, others who have done the job previously, Kevin de Bruyne and Bernardo, on the bench and Ilkay Gundogan overlooked for the role since his return from Barcelona in the summer, Guardiola stepped in to make sure Haaland - who last month signed a new deal that runs to 2034 - took the role.\n\"When Kyle left, Kevin became the first but I nominated Erling, not them,\" said the City boss.\n\"When a player is going to be here 10 years, sooner or later, you need to take the responsibility. He did it for the first time.\"\nGuardiola also played down the injury Haaland appeared to suffer in the final minutes.\nThe Norway international initially sat down and flexed his leg before the physios came on. It was immediately decided to take him off.\nHowever, Haaland watched the remainder of the game from the bench and went back on to the pitch to shake hands with opposition players after the final whistle.\n\"When he went down, everyone was scared,\" added Guardiola.\n\"But he got up and walked away smiling as always. I didn't speak with him but the doctors didn't come with bad news.

He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany of Doge's staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later said he was operating as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation is officially defined as those working for the government for 130 days or less in a year.\nTo some supporters of this new body, Doge's outsider status - as well as its somewhat vague mandate - will increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIts mission, says Musk, is to save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn).\nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nMusk has said he wants to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", what he describes as a fourth branch of government working against Trump's agenda.

        "article_text": "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nKendrick Lamar's most famous lyric was the heard around the world at last weekend's Super Bowl.\nAn estimated 127 million viewers saw the rapper flash a devious smile to the camera as he delivered the line - a withering takedown of bitter rival Drake.\nTaken from Grammy-winning track Not Like Us, it refers to accusations that the Canadian star had relationships with underage women - something he's denied.\nBut as 70,000 fans inside New Orlean's Caesars Superdome belted it out with him, it felt like Kendrick's winning play in the pair's long-running beef. \nIt's been public, personal and petty, but Kendrick has implied that he's waging a much wider war. \nNot just against Drake, but against what he represents.\n\"Drake is the face of the hip-hop scene as it is,\" says Margs, a London rapper who hosts rap battles on his channel Pen Game. \nThe Canadian is a huge commercial success - the most streamed artist of the 2010s, 143 million Instagram followers and a fixture on party playlists and nightclub set lists.\nHis style is melodic and accessible. He sings. \nIn other words, he's as much a pop star as he is a rapper. And where Drake goes, others follow.\n\"A lot of people see him as being responsible for the watering down of the product,\" says Margs.\n\"There's people that like the commercial side of music that just want to dance and enjoy themselves and it have no substance to it. \n\"And then there's the other side which is deep-rooted in the hip-hop culture.\"\nIt's a culture Kendrick wants to defend and celebrate.\nSpeaking before the Super Bowl show, he said the \"grit\" had gone from the genre. \n\"When people talk about rap, the conversations I'm hearing, they think it's just rapping, it's not an actual art form,\" he said.\nKendrick also took issue with rap being \"minimised to a catchy song or verse\", and said his feud with Drake actually came \"more from a space of more people putting rap to the back\".\n\"You didn't see that grit, you didn't see that bite any more. So I always took that into consideration with my music,\" he said.\nNot everyone agrees that a more mainstream-friendly version of rap makes Drake less credible.\nHis one-time rival Common recently defended him against the \"pop star\" label - saying that \"he's still an MC\" even though his songs are popular.\nKendrick, though, is passionate about rap as an artform, and said the success of Not Like Us and being chosen as the first solo hip-hop artist to front the halftime show \"meant everything\".\n\"To represent it on this type of stage is just everything that I've worked for and everything I believe in for the culture, I live and die by it,\" he said.\nHip-hop, a genre which has been around for 50 years, has a long history of protest.\nMargs says \"a lot of that has been lost\" when comparing current trends with the genre's origins.\n\"They cared about the message and what it stands for because hip-hop was something that was heavily politicised,\" he says.\n\"People used to use their voices in hip-hop to protest and get their messages out.\"\nThe political messaging in Kendrick's halftime show came from the start when actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as US government icon Uncle Sam, introduced the rapper.\nFrom there, it included references to the black power movement, imagery of a divided United States and, just before the finale, the line: \"This is bigger than the music.\"\nIt's a time of political change in the US following the re-election of Donald Trump, who was at the Super Bowl.\n\"There's no better time for people to stand on business and talk about things that matter,\" Margs says. \nKendrick - and his beef with Drake - also hark back to the origins of hip-hop in another way. \nHe's said he sees rap as a sport - and battle raps were his inspiration for the back-and-forth with Drake.\nThese face-offs - as seen in the Eminem film 8Mile - are where artists compete live, swapping disses and trying to spit the best bars to take home the prize.\nIt's rap in its purest form - substance over style and a focus on lyricism.\nKendrick said it's always been that way for him, and it's a vital part of finding the \"grit\" and \"bite\" he feels is missing.\n\"I still watch battle raps, this has always been the core definition of who I am and it's been this way since day one,\" he said.\nMargs thinks Kendrick's success will shine a light on battle rap, but he acknowledges emerging rappers are now finding new ways to cut their teeth. \nAmong them is Layyah, who was the first female rapper to win The Rap Game UK.\nShe's Team Kendrick, but doesn't plan on following his example on battle rap. \nLayyah says rap artists she looks up to like Central Cee are \"definitely not battle rappers\" but have found success and respect through other routes. \n\"We have so many platforms,\" she says. \"It's more like who can make a great song and then who can make the best routine to it.\n\"If that goes viral then it's a great song, you don't really have to do the battle raps.\"\nMargs thinks that's \"taken away from the art form a little bit\".\n\"You can win a battle on social media just through popularity or being funny... whereas with battle rap it's all about your lyrics and your skill.\"\nAs for Kendrick's beef with Drake, it's stayed quiet since Not Like Us was released last summer.\nSome people took the \"Game Over\" at the end of Kendrick's Super Bowl set as the end of the battle, and Drake's just released Gimme a Hug.\nIn that he suggests he wants to put the beef behind him and \"get the party lit\".\nBut there's still an ongoing legal case over Not Like Us - with the potential of a bitter courtroom face-off.\nMargs says that's a big contrast to settling scores on the battle rap stage. \n\"There's a sportsmanship to it but never spills over into more than that,\" says Margs.\n\"After the fight, they always hug it out and show respect for their competitor.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Nada Hafez competed for Egypt in the women's individual sabre fencing event at the Paris Olympics while seven months pregnant\n\"I was thinking about my baby, that I want my baby to be an Olympian.\" \nThat was the extra motivation that Egyptian fencer Nada Hafez needed when she took to the piste at Paris 2024.\nOnly a select few knew she was competing while seven months pregnant until she revealed the news on social media following her last-16 exit from her event. \nIt made headlines the world over.\nThe whirlwind reaction was like nothing Hafez had experienced before.\n\"I was just posting on my personal account - proud, saying I'm in the top 16 in the world while pregnant,\" Hafez told BBC Sport Africa. \n\"I didn't expect this would go viral. I didn't know what was going on.\"\nThe 27-year-old says the majority of responses to her message were positive.\n\"When the post went up, and I was an inspiration for everyone, this was a big thing for me.\"\nHafez, who is a clinical pathologist, says she had been given clearance from doctors to fence at the Games and wanted to show the world what a woman's body can do.\n\"This was a really important message for me - an Egyptian Arab woman - to tell all women that your body can surprise you,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes you need to see an example in front of you to know that you can do it. \n\"Because maybe a pregnant woman, she's afraid to do anything, and now she tells herself: 'There's a woman who competes at the Olympics while pregnant. So I can do whatever'.\"\nHafez upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky of the United States, in her first match at Paris 2024\nBut not everyone was so supportive of Hafez revealing that she fenced in the women's individual sabre at the Grand Palais while carrying a baby.\nA day later Hafez put out another Instagram post to emphasise she was not the first pregnant woman to appear at an Olympics and that she had wanted to \"shed light on the strength, perseverance and relentlessness\" of Egyptian women.\nThat strength came to the fore when dealing with negativity online.\n\"Some people don't want to see you succeed,\" she reflected.\n\"It's easy to put a comment and run. You don't face me.\n\"I wanted to clarify that I'm a doctor and this (competing while pregnant) is something that is not against any medical issues.\n\"Some people were saying I should have given the place to someone else. But this was not an option because I qualified.\n\"My mum told me 'Don't be sad if you read anything' - but I'm proud of what I did. I achieved something and it was very challenging.\"\nWith fencing being a combat sport using swords, could that have provoked the negative comments?\n\"For me, fencing is not as it looks - it has this sense of touch. My doctor assured me that it's not unsafe.\"\nHafez took up fencing aged 12 and has appeared at the past three editions of the Olympic Games\nCairo-based Hafez, who pursued her passion for fencing while studying for her medical degree, became an Egyptian sabre champion and went to both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games. \nSo, having qualified for Paris 2024, did she consider pulling out when she discovered she was pregnant? \n\"Yes, of course. I knew I was pregnant a week before a World Cup [event], and I said, 'Okay, I won't chance it because it's my first pregnancy',\" she explained.\n\"I didn't know how I would feel. \n\"I was waiting for my husband [a cardiothoracic surgeon] to tell me to stop and take rest. But he told me: 'We'll go to the doctor. Whatever he says, we'll do.'\n\"And the doctor said: 'You don't have a disease. You're just pregnant. If you're okay and everything is normal, you can do whatever you want.'\"\nWith that reassurance, Hafez felt ready to resume training. \nMindful of the spotlight falling on her nation if the news came out, she kept it as quiet as she could.\n\"I didn't have to tell anyone, because it's not against Olympic regulations,\" she said.\n\"I just told the people who needed to know. The most important thing was not to go against any laws or health conditions.\n\"I didn't know if I would make it so I took it step by step until I reached the Olympics.\"\nEgypt's National Olympic Committee told BBC Sport Africa it has no rules barring pregnant women from training or competing.\n\"But it has to be a safe environment and we have to make sure there is no risk involved,\" an official said.\nNada Hafez was full of emotion after she made it through to the last 16 of the Paris Games, her third Olympics having also competed at at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020\nNow a mum to four-month-old baby Zaina, Hafez can reflect on the part her daughter played in her achievements in Paris.\n\"I worked with my mental coach. I wanted to do something different for my baby,\" she said.\n\"I tried not to think that I have my excuse not to win. I thought differently: 'I'm pregnant and I will win', and I did it.\"\nHafez went on to upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky, 15-13.\n\"It's one of the best results for female Egyptian Olympians,\" Hafez added.\n\"I was crying with happiness. This is something for my baby to be proud of.\"\nShe then lost 15-7 to Jeon Hayoung of South Korea in the last 16.\nNeither of her opponents knew Hafez was expecting. \n\"It's unfair if someone knows. Maybe they'd be afraid to put a touch or something, so no need to tell them.\"\nHafez, who is studying for a masters degree alongside being a new mum, is aiming to use her platform to stand up for women's rights in sport.\nShe has not yet decided whether she wants to try and qualify for Los Angeles 2028.\nFor now, she is still processing what she achieved in Paris.\n\"Young girls told me, 'You've inspired us so much. We want to go to medical school and continue in sports',\" she said.\n\"And that made me happiest.\n\"Whenever I get a message from anyone telling me I'm a role model it sets my heart on fire - because that's what I'm working on for my whole life.\n\"I'm still young. I'm aiming to do more and be a good example as a mum.\n\"I hope my daughter will be an Olympian one day. She's a baby Olympian - and maybe she'll be an adult Olympian.\"",

        "article_text": "What next for Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs after such a damaging Super Bowl defeat?\nThe Kansas City Chiefs went into Super Bowl 59 chasing greatness, but they came out of it with serious questions over whether their dynasty years have come to a devastatingly abrupt end.\nIt was not losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, a team widely recognised as having the most talented roster in the NFL, that was the problem, but the manner of such a one-sided blowout.\nThe 40-22 scoreline in New Orleans flattered the Chiefs. If the game was all but over at 24-0 when Kendrick Lamar performed the half-time show, it was definitely done and dusted at 34-0 in the third quarter.\nOnly the Eagles taking their foot off the gas enabled Patrick Mahomes to avoid the ignominy of a first Super Bowl shutout. That would have been harsh on a team that came closer than any team before them to winning three in a row.\nSo was it just a really bad day at the office or a sign that 'Chiefs Kingdom' is crumbling? \nSuper Bowl 59 - As it happened\nEagles demolish Chiefs to deny them Super Bowl three-peat\nThis video can not be played\nPhiladelphia Eagles destroy Kansas City Chiefs to win Super Bowl\nThis battle was won and lost in the trenches, as so many are, with Philadelphia's defensive line bullying their opposition, leading to constant pressure on Mahomes - pressure he failed to handle.\nIn terms of execution, Nick Sirianni's side produced their best performance of the season in the biggest game while the Chiefs saved their worst for last.\nThen there were the mistakes.\nAndy Reid's side built their season on winning 12 one-score games. That means stout defence, limiting turnovers and costly penalties, and making the most of the ball when they have it.\nThey did the exact opposite in the Superdome on Sunday.\nA pair of Mahomes interceptions cost them 14 points, while penalties hurt them on Philadelphia's opening touchdown drive, erased a crucial sack on Jalen Hurts and chalked off a stunning Mahomes first-down run.\nThose types of errors were so unlike the Chiefs this season - and it cost them a shot at history.\nThis video can not be played\n'It's the worst feeling in the world' - Mahomes on Super Bowl defeat\nPhiladelphia's defence was brilliant, especially up front as they sacked Mahomes six times, just one off the Super Bowl record, and had him under pressure from the first snap.\nIt was a similar story in Mahomes' other Super Bowl loss, also a blowout against Tampa Bay, and maybe some demons from that game contributed as he had arguably the worst game of his career.\nMahomes passed for a career-worst 33 yards in the first half as he failed to get the Chiefs into Philadelphia's half - and his total quarterback rating (QBR) of 11.4 was his second-worst in 133 career games.\nYes, he was under constant pressure, but his decision-making was off. He was too quick to take off and run, perhaps understandably given how his offensive line was being manhandled.\nBut his head was down, he missed some crucial throws - a possible Xavier Worthy touchdown and first-down conversion to Travis Kelce just two of them.\nCutting a rabbit in the headlights figure was strange for a three-time champion and one of the best ever at the position.\n\"I just didn't play to my standard and I have to be better next time,\" admitted Mahomes. How he responds now could define his legacy.\nEagles outclass Chiefs to win Super Bowl - in pictures\nWatch: Eagles celebrate Super Bowl win in locker room\nThe Chiefs have been the dominant force in the NFL since Mahomes' first Super Bowl success in 2020 - in a league with everything set up to stop that happening it has been an impressive run.\nGetting so far each year means shorter off-seasons, lower draft picks and tougher fixtures - plus a huge target on your back each season.\nBut both Mahomes and Travis Kelce had significant down years this year, with Taylor Swift's other half also now 35 and said to be mulling retirement.\nHead coach Reid is 66 and after a second Super Bowl blowout loss a significant rebuild could be in order - but they have some key members of the squad out of contract and money is tight in salary cap space.\nThese things go in cycles and a 'Super Bowl window' is often mentioned as the perfect combination of established stars on manageable contracts combined with star draft picks all meshing at the right time.\nThe Chiefs keeping that window open for this long has been special, but perhaps it is finally closing.\nPatrick Mahomes was sacked six times and hit 11 by the Eagles defence in Super Bowl 59\nTwo Super Bowls have now been lost due to Kansas City not being able to protect Mahomes well enough. That now has to be a priority.\nIs the Chiefs' front office not bringing in the right draft picks and free agents? Is it a coaching blindspot on Reid's staff? These questions need answering.\nMahomes was sacked and hit more times than any other season in his career, while the Chiefs now have the top two pressure rates allowed when not even being blitzed in Super Bowl history.\nThat means the opposition can get to Mahomes without sending extra men so can still cover his receivers. It's a combination that will not only stop them winning more Super Bowls but also puts his health at risk.\nThe Chiefs have a huge commodity at quarterback, it's time they started protecting their star asset.\nSteve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defence was the only bright spot as they shackled Saquon Barkley. Yes, the Eagles scored 40 points, but the Chiefs' defence had some short fields to guard after turnovers and spending so long out there, the unit did well considering. \nSo there could be an overreaction here. After all, the Chiefs have become a winning machine under Reid and Mahomes - getting to the AFC title game in seven straight years shows you that.\nEven after their 31-9 hammering in Super Bowl 55, their 'rebuilding year' was a 12-5 record and overtime defeat against Joe Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship.\nThat was followed by one of Mahomes' most prolific seasons, a 14-3 record and the first of back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 2023 - so although this loss cuts deep, there is no need to hit the panic button just yet.\nIs there work to do? Absolutely. But everything we have seen so far from Reid and Mahomes suggests that is something they will really relish.\nIt would be more of a surprise if the Chiefs were not right back in the thick of it next season. \nGet NFL news & reports sent straight to your phone\nSwift, Trump and a dynasty in ruins - how Super Bowl 59 unfolded\nSuper Bowl all-time record book\nThe night the Super Bowl lights went out in New Orleans",

That means stout defence, limiting turnovers and costly penalties, and making the most of the ball when they have it.They did the exact opposite in the Superdome on Sunday.A pair of Mahomes interceptions cost them 14 points, while penalties hurt them on Philadelphia's opening touchdown drive, erased a crucial sack on Jalen Hurts and chalked off a stunning Mahomes first-down run.Those types of errors were so unlike the Chiefs this season - and it cost them a shot at history.Mahomes failed to handle the pressureThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'It's the worst feeling in the world' - Mahomes on Super Bowl defeatPhiladelphia's defence was brilliant, especially up front as they sacked Mahomes six times, just one off the Super Bowl record, and had him under pressure from the first snap.It was a similar story in Mahomes' other Super Bowl loss, also a blowout against Tampa Bay, and maybe some demons from that game contributed as he had arguably the worst game of his career.Mahomes passed for a career-worst 33 yards in the first half as he failed to get the Chiefs into Philadelphia's half - and his total quarterback rating (QBR) of 11.4 was his second-worst in 133 career games.Yes, he was under constant pressure, but his decision-making was off. After all, the Chiefs have become a winning machine under Reid and Mahomes - getting to the AFC title game in seven straight years shows you that.Even after their 31-9 hammering in Super Bowl 55, their 'rebuilding year' was a 12-5 record and overtime defeat against Joe Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship.That was followed by one of Mahomes' most prolific seasons, a 14-3 record and the first of back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 2023 - so although this loss cuts deep, there is no need to hit the panic button just yet.Is there work to do?",

        "article_text": "YouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep secret.\nYouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch?\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users \u2013 almost one in three people on Earth \u2013 and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths.\nIf we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history.\nHow many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you.\nExperts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created \u2013 a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas \u2013 is operating in the dark.\nIn part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time.\nYou might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret.\nA Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue.\n\"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\"\nBut Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example.\nSo, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet.\n\"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\"\nSo, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video.\nWhen the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is.\nThe first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos.\nZuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.\nFor many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals.\nOnly 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe.\nThose with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images.\nThe top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long.\nYouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" \u2013 but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\".\nThis narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says.\n\"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\"\nYouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\"\nGoogle is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\nBut YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says.\n\"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\"\nThe most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film.

She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect.

A bit of a throwback. The place was boiling hot all night. It was an incredible atmosphere.\"\nAnd in those few words, Moyes summed up the special magic of Goodison Park.\nIt may be creaking in parts, but on fiery nights like this with Liverpool as the opposition, it literally rocks - parts of it really do - with a glorious support and naked hostility like few other places in world football.\nEverton may have that state-of-the-art new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock ready to go next season, but it is an almost impossible task to replicate what they have in this place - ramshackle and old-fashioned in parts admittedly, hence the need to move.\nGoodison Park was never going to go quietly, but this was something else - full of emotion, passion and all the wild scenes of indiscipline Moyes called \"to-ing and fro-ing\" after the final whistle.\nIt may have pillars blocking some of the views, but it still has so much that will be missed with its towering Main Stand and the criss-cross designs on the stands that are the trademark of famous Scottish architect Archibald Leitch.

        "article_text": "How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nA popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: \"I don't care about Levy, he doesn't care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski.\"\nProminent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: \"Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed\" and \"24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change\".\nA crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.\nThe debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.\nFan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.\nClub sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.\nTottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.\nA 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\nLast week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.\nAmong those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.\nBBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.\nSome of the key points made were:\nLevy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structures\nHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide away\nAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially\nClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals\nSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies.\nA banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy's tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the \"most profitable club in Premier League history\" because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a \"degree of caution\" on transfer spending.\nHe describes Spurs as a \"superb cash-making machine\" who have \"outperformed any other club in England\".\nMaguire outlined:\nHis figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made \u00a3171m profit. Burnley were second on \u00a3159m, with Arsenal third on \u00a3105m\nIn the past decade, Spurs have the sixth-highest total wage bill in the Premier League (\u00a31.6bn vs Man City's \u00a32.9bn as the highest); the sixth-highest transfer spend (\u00a31.3bn vs Chelsea's \u00a32.8bn as the most); with the fifth-highest net spend over a similar period\nTottenham fans pay among the highest season ticket prices and matchday prices in the top flight\nLevy has the highest chief executive pay of Premier League clubs that declare such data. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned \u00a36.6m.\nDaniel Levy has been Tottenham's chairman since 2001\nClub insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham's progress under his leadership.\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be \"very ruthless\" but \"genuinely wants the best for Spurs\".\nThey claimed some of the \"own goals\" - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not \"surround himself with the best people\". \nThey described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as \"people too similar to him\" who will \"sit with their heads in their phones\", rather than \"people who make up for [Levy's] weaknesses\".\nThe source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: \"One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot.\"\nWhile Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".\nAnother source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".\nThey added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.\nFrom the archive: Inside Levy's 20 years at Tottenham (2021)\nPostecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy?\nIs Postecoglou's style causing Tottenham's injury crisis?\nSources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. \nThey say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table.\nWhile Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner.\nThat means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say.\nDuring the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club.\nOther sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League's highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated \u00a350m-plus over his 25 years in charge.\nThis week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs' ownership situation played it down.\nIn 2023, when Paris St-Germain's owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\nOne source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \"more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement\" - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates.\nVarious reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn.\nChelsea were bought in a deal worth up to \u00a34.25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was \u00a32.5bn with a commitment to spending \u00a31.75bn over the next 10 years.\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for \u00a31.03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to \u00a35bn for 100% of the club.\nDespite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential.\nAccording to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new \u00a31.2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was \"all-consumed\" and the board \"left everyone to do their jobs\". \nSpurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.\nThat source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.\nPaul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.\nIt could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".\nAnother source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".\nThey said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.\nHowever, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. \nOne criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.\nLevy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".\nThey are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.\nThe source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.\nThey added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.\nIt was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".\nSources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. \nThey will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation.\nTottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.\nIt is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models.\nSpurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the 'traditional top six' are either richer or bigger.\n\"We don't make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don't apologise at all,\" Levy said at September's fan forum.\n\"We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we've got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we're looking for.\"\nIn a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United's 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. \nThey believe a \"vocal minority\" of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change.\nThey added: \"Spurs haven't got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come.\"\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

But other than Haaland, who got four, no-one scored more.\nMarmoush hits quickfire treble as Man City thrash Newcastle\nOmar Marmoush had scored 20 goals in all competitions for Eintracht Frankfurt this term, when he joined Manchester City\nIt is that issue Guardiola was trying to address when he called contacts in Germany to check up on Marmoush after sporting director Txiki Begiristain had put the Egyptian's name forward as a part of City's overall \u00a3180m January transfer window spend.\n\"When Txiki came to me I said, because of the season we had, the more players you bring the better,\" said Guardiola.\n\"I called some contacts in Germany because I have friends there. I asked a few things and there was a high opinion in many things; behaviour, in training sessions, goals.\n\"He's young and comes here to make his career. That is why the club decides. They always have the last word.\"\nMarmoush had already demanded attention through the 20 goals he scored for Eintracht in the first half of this season.\nAt 26, City were buying someone approaching the prime of their career.\nOn the evidence of his performance against Newcastle, Marmoush drives forward with purpose when the ball is at his feet, is quick and can find space. \nEvidently he presents a danger opposition defences cannot ignore \u2013 and Newcastle could not contain.\nThat, in turn, may take some of the focus away from Haaland.\n\"Everything about his game was impressive,\" former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day. \n\"Already he has a good understanding with Haaland. Newcastle couldn't live with him.\"\n\"We knew with the dynamic he would be good,\" added Guardiola. \"In Germany he made good numbers and he had three chances last week against [Leyton] Orient but didn't score.\n\"He likes to attack the space. It is simple. When you play well, everybody adapts quick. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments because they will come now.\"\nIt was one of those rare occasions when Haaland didn't score and contributed a single assist, for James McAtee, six minutes from time.\nYet his industry was notable, leading from the front in a performance befitting his status as captain for the first time.\nNormally, Guardiola stays out of the captaincy issue, preferring to let the players decide on the leadership group.\nHowever, with club skipper Kyle Walker now at AC Milan, others who have done the job previously, Kevin de Bruyne and Bernardo, on the bench and Ilkay Gundogan overlooked for the role since his return from Barcelona in the summer, Guardiola stepped in to make sure Haaland - who last month signed a new deal that runs to 2034 - took the role.\n\"When Kyle left, Kevin became the first but I nominated Erling, not them,\" said the City boss.\n\"When a player is going to be here 10 years, sooner or later, you need to take the responsibility. He did it for the first time.\"\nGuardiola also played down the injury Haaland appeared to suffer in the final minutes.\nThe Norway international initially sat down and flexed his leg before the physios came on. It was immediately decided to take him off.\nHowever, Haaland watched the remainder of the game from the bench and went back on to the pitch to shake hands with opposition players after the final whistle.\n\"When he went down, everyone was scared,\" added Guardiola.\n\"But he got up and walked away smiling as always. I didn't speak with him but the doctors didn't come with bad news.

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings. They already tell us what to say on the radio.\n\"But when you hear that passion, those words, even if sometimes we swear on the radio, for me that's a keeper in F1 and it is something we shouldn't get rid of.\"\nThe FIA has not explained how the new system will be applied, but last year president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said he wanted to stop drivers swearing while driving.\nSainz said the drivers have not had any clarification from the FIA.\nHe and Albon both drove Williams' new 2025 car as it was unveiled at Silverstone on Friday.\nVerstappen restricts answers after 'ridiculous' swearing punishment\nFerrari's Leclerc fined for swearing in news conference\nF1 drivers ask FIA to treat them like adults\nSainz explained that his first impressions were \"positive\", and he said Williams' willingness to host a day for media and sponsors and give the car its debut at the same time was indicative of the progress the team had made.\nLast year, the team struggled at the start of the season as attempts to introduce new processes in the team delayed the car build. A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

You're entitled to your opinion.\nBut what's not in doubt is that they all went viral on YouTube, which is now 20 years old.\nIt's become the place where 2.5 billion people log on monthly to kill time, be entertained and, sometimes at least, learn something.\nBut it's also been life-changing for some of its breakout stars, like Charlie.\nYou wouldn't recognise him now but millions around the world have watched him, as a baby, chomping on his big brother's digits. \nThat's because he's the star of Charlie Bit My Finger.\n\"It was never not a part of my life, it's always been there,\" Charlie, who's now 18, tells BBC Newsbeat.\nThe 55-second clip has had almost 900 million views since it was uploaded in 2007.\nCharlie says he can't remember the moment, filmed when he was \"about one\" and sitting on Harry's lap.\nHe says the clip's success has made life \"easier\" and helped him get to university where he now studies law.\nHis dad Howard Davies-Carr previously told Newsbeat the family had made an estimated \u00a31,000,000 off the video over the years.\nThe video was sold as a non-fungible token, or NFT, for \u00a3500,000 in 2021.\nBut Mr Davies-Carr said he wanted to keep the boys \"very grounded\" in how they live their lives.\nCharlie shares that view and says he doesn't play the \"don't you know who I am?\" card.\n\"It's not like I use it as an icebreaker or anything,\" he says. \n\"I was never going to use this as a fun fact.\"\nCharlie says he doesn't want to be seen as a show-off, so when asked about himself volunteers \"something else a bit more boring\".\n\"But my friends like to tell people [sometimes], so it's hard keeping it locked down,\" says. \n\"It slips out every now and then.\n\"And people are like: 'Oh that's cool', for like five minutes. Or they say: 'I don't know what that is.'\"\nYouTube was founded on 14 February 2005 by three friends - Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim - all former employees of the online payment system PayPal.\nWhile the first video published on 23 April 2005 was not quite Baby Shark, it did have an animal theme. \nIt was a 19-second clip called Me at the zoo, posted by co-founder Jawed.\nThe founders opened the first YouTube headquarters in an office above a California pizza restaurant.\nIt is now owned by Google and has offices all over the world.\nIn the UK, 82% of adult internet users in the UK have reported using the platform - more than WhatsApp (80%), Facebook (76%) and Instagram (57%).\nNow YouTube is a destination many choose for the latest trailers, reviews and news.\nBut it is music videos which dominate the most-viewed list, with Baby Shark Dance having more than 15 billion watches.\nDespacito by Luis Fonsi has more than eight billion, Shape of You by Ed Sheeran has more than six billion views and PSY's Gangnam Style has 5.4 billion.\nAnd while Charlie's family has been helped by income from YouTube, some of its biggest names have made a fortune.\nAmerican YouTuber MrBeast, a.k.a Jimmy Donaldson, is the most popular YouTuber with more than 360 million subscribers.\nBusiness magazine Forbes estimates that he earned $85 million (\u00a368 million) in 2024, making him the highest-paid creator.\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing in the platform's two decades.\nFact-checking organisations around the world have previously said that YouTube is not doing enough to prevent misinformation on the platform.\nThe site has also been punished for privacy violations, being fined $170m (\u00a3139m) by a US regulator for violating children's privacy laws.\nIn 2023, it was accused of collecting the viewing data of children aged under 13, in breach of a UK data privacy code.\nAnd there has been criticism that, like other online platforms, violent and extremist videos have been available to view despite government calls for their removal.\nJournalist Tamzin Kraftman, who covers technology news, feels while the platform has managed to stay relevant against competition from TikTok and Instagram, there are challenges with combating things like misinformation.\n\"No team can go through everything with a fine-toothed comb,\" she says.\n\"So the question is how they will ensure everything on there is correct and within regulations.\"\nTamzin tells Newsbeat AI could play a big role in helping to deal with those issues, but \"might get things wrong and could ban the wrong channel\".\n\"I think it's how they use new tools to really stop the spread of misinformation that is going to be their golden ticket [going forward].\"\nAnd Charlie doesn't think the platform is \"dying out\" any time soon, years on from his flutter with fame.\nWhile he doesn't remember loads from then, he is grateful for the opportunities it has brought.\nHe has managed to travel \"a decent amount\" and been to the United States, filming a flight-safety video.\nAs for whether he's tried to recreate the bite?\n\"I haven't since I was very young.\n\"I could start charging now. But I feel like I've lost my ability,\" he says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the chancellor's online CV, and the use of expenses while working at a bank, in the wake of a BBC News investigation.\nRachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.\nIt was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nSir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter. \nThe initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.\nWe have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.\nA spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.\n\nBBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP\nIn a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.\nThe prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".\nHe said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.\nShe posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"\nRachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.\nThe chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.\nOn the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.\nHowever, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.\nThey said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.\nSpeaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.\nAsked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"\nThe Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.\nReeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006\nThe rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.\nA photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.\nA former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.\nIn a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"\nIn a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\" \nShe said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.\nThe claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".\nAs she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nLast year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.\nReeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.\nShe stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.\nThe chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.\nIn fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".\nThe bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.\nA compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.\nReeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.\nShe then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.\nThe MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.\nHer LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".\nIt had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank but she instead held a management role in the bank's Customer Relations department, which dealt with complaints.\nIn November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.\nThe prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.\nThe spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".\n\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.\nIf you have any information on stories you would like to share with the BBC Politics Investigations team, please get in touch at politicsinvestigations@bbc.co.uk",

        "article_text": "It has been more than a decade since James Howells' hard drive - containing Bitcoin now worth hundreds of millions of pounds - ended up on a landfill site. \nBut despite facing numerous setbacks, he is determined to continue on his mission to retrieve it.\n\"This is my job, if you will.

He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year. \nNewport council said it was making no further comment on the matter.\nMr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value.\nHe has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive \u2013 about the size of a mobile phone \u2013 containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013. As its value soared, he organised a team of experts to attempt to locate and recover it.\nHe repeatedly asked permission from the council for access to the site, offering it a share of the missing Bitcoin if it was successfully recovered.\nAfter Mr Howells launched legal proceedings, the council applied for a High Court hearing to ask a judge to dismiss the claim before going to trial \u2013 which the judge did last month.\nThe council argued its environmental permits would forbid any attempt to excavate the site for the search and previously said such work \"would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area\".\nUnwilling to give up, Mr Howells now believes he has two options open to him to retrieve the digital wallet \u2013 launch a case at the Court of Appeal, or work with investors to try to buy the landfill site from the council, after it announced the site is \"coming to the end of its life\" and it plans to close it within the next two years.\nMr Howells told BBC News he was pleased with the work his legal team had done in the High Court trial, but that he would now be representing himself in a case filed with the Court of Appeal \u2013 using an \"artificial intelligence agent\" to assist his claim.\nHe described AI as \"an absolutely amazing technology\" that had helped him better understand court processes and the law, and that he believed he had about seven \"solid grounds in law\" for his case, which he hopes to be able to present in-person to the Court of Appeal.\nOne of the arguments in his case will centre on the council's plans to close the site, something he argued should have been revealed during the High Court trial.\n\"That is material information that should have been made [at the trial] \u2013 the judge should have been aware of that, as well as myself,\" he said.\nMr Howells also said buying and fully excavating the site would save the council what he argued were significant maintenance costs once the site closes.\n\"Every single piece would be extracted or recycled, and at the end of the process we would have a hard drive in our hands - and we would also have an empty landfill,\" he said.\nIn the High Court trial, the council also argued that the hard drive became its property as soon as it entered the landfill site, but Mr Howells said this failed to take into account the fact it was his ex-partner who threw it out.\n\"It was taken without my permission or consent,\" he said.\nMr Howells said he was also exploring the option of buying the site from the council, adding he had \"preliminary agreements\" with investors \u2013 including those in the Middle East and the United States \u2013 who could make funding available if he had permission to buy the site.\n\"They're not just going to put millions of quid in my back pocket... but if the council show a willingness to sell the site, then the funding will be available,\" he said.\nThe council has made no indication it is interested in selling the site and, as part of its closure, has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.\nHaving spent many years pursuing it, including opening legal cases, Mr Howells said he was certain the hard drive remained on the landfill, which holds more than 1.4 million tonnes of waste.\nHe said he had done his \"due diligence and research\", having spoken to a site manager at the landfill.\n\"Anything that was put into that site is still there. So, where else could it be?\"\nAsked if he would ever give up his mission to retrieve it, he said: \"Absolutely not. This is like the final battle in Braveheart.\"\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.\nBitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit. \nSatoshis are named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 believed to be a pseudonym \u2013 who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.\nThose investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a \"very small\" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.\nBitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being \"very quickly enamoured with it\", Mr Bambrough said.\nPrices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when \"stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely\".\n\"A lot of people got very rich, but a lot of people also lost money,\" Mr Bambrough said.\nThe cryptocurrency also saw rapid increases in late 2024, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the US general election, with his administration being seen as far friendlier towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.\n\"A lot of people in the crypto and Bitcoin worlds say the price has gone up so much in such a short amount of time, they claim it could go higher and higher,\" Mr Bambrough said.\n\"So I can understand why James [Howells] is keen to find his Bitcoin.\"",

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

        "article_text": "Moments in human history are etched into the Earth. Now researchers are piecing together evidence of our impact on the planet \u2013 through the marks we've left on nature.\nThe microbes living in this French harbour have never recovered from World War Two. Between 2012 and 2017, Raffaele Siano pulled sediment cores from the seabed at Brest harbour, wondering what he was going to find. When he and his colleagues at the French Institute for Ocean Science (Ifremer), analysed the fragments of DNA captured in those cores \u2013 they discovered something remarkable.\nThe oldest, deepest layers of sediment \u2013 dating to before 1941 \u2013 had traces of plankton called dinoflagellates that were strikingly different to the genetic traces of plankton left in the shallower, more recent layers. \"There was a group, an order of these dinoflagellates, that was very abundant before World War Two \u2013 and after World War Two it almost disappeared,\" says Siano. He and his colleagues published a study detailing their findings in 2021.\nSiano mentions that Brest harbour had been bombed during the war. Then, in 1947, a Norwegian cargo ship exploded in the Bay of Brest. The disaster killed 22 people and spread ammonium nitrate, a toxic chemical used to make fertiliser and explosives, into the sea. Even younger sediment in the 1980s and 1990s showed further changes in the plankton community in the harbour. \"We correlated this from another type of pollution coming from intensive agricultural activities,\" says Siano.\nNature has a way of remembering things. Echoes of certain human activities, especially highly-polluting ones, sometimes show up in tree rings, coastal sediments and ecosystems. Arguably, these traces are hints of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch in which humanity is said to have irrevocably, and drastically, altered Earth. Human history, it turns out, is written into the very fabric of our planet \u2013 and the life that co-exists here with us.\nSiano and his colleagues are predominantly ecologists but they also work with historians. \"The land changed because of human impact and also because of historical events,\" Siano says. When the team analysed the sediment cores from Brest, they also detected a gradual rise in heavy metal pollution as time passed. Younger layers of sediment contained higher volumes of mercury, copper, lead and zinc, for example.\nThe report notes there were similar levels of some of these metals \u2013 especially lead and chromium \u2013 in Pearl Harbour, a major US naval base in Hawaii that was heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes in 1941. However, Siano adds that he can't be sure whether these metals came directly from the bombs themselves. Either way, there is a signal in both Brest and Pearl Harbour of a calamitous, and polluting, moment in human history.\nOther researchers have also scoured the planet in search of geological records of anthropogenic pollution. In China, soil sediments reveal a sharp increase in metal contamination since 1950 \u2013 which correlates with a rise in air pollution there during the second half of the 20th Century. A separate study explores how the emergence of industries such as shipbuilding may be linked with a higher incidence of heavy metal deposits in tree rings from certain parts of China.\nEven Roman metallurgy, from many centuries ago, has left its mark. One 2022 study found a noticeable rise in lead contamination in ice, sediment and peat cores from Europe, correlated with the development of Roman industry. It is sometimes difficult to be sure which specific events caused spikes in lead contamination, however, note the authors.\nJean-Luc Loizeau at the University of Geneva has studied the sediment of Lake Geneva, particularly the material found in a small area of the lake near to a wastewater treatment plant. He says the sediment there contains many traces of human activities. Crucially, the way water moves around in this part of the lake has helped to preserve such clues.\n\"It accumulates because there is a kind of gyre that keeps the sediment within the bay,\" he says, referring to Vidy Bay, on the northern shores of the lake. In a 2017 paper, he and colleagues describe the heavy metal pollution that became evident here in sediment layers dating to the 1930s. Among the specific examples he gives is a spike in mercury contamination during the 1970s.\n\"We know there was an accident in one of these industries,\" explains Loizeau. \"There was some spilling of mercury because there was a break in a tank and we really find this peak in the sediment.\" Plus, traces of elements such as barium in the cores could be linked to the rise of the automobile, adds Loizeau \u2013 because car brakes often contain barium.\nBesides metals, radioactive materials have also found applications in various industries. In Switzerland, for instance, radium was long used to make glow-in-the-dark details on watch faces. Remnants of radium from the watchmaking industry have turned up in landfill sites and buildings in the country.\nAnd scattered around the globe are pieces of evidence that reveal the grim legacy left by nuclear weapons during the 20th Century. Take the giant craters in the Nevada desert made by huge weapons tests, for example. But some contamination caused by nuclear detonations is much more subtle.\nIn 2019, researchers revealed that some of the grains of sand on beaches near the Japanese city of Hiroshima are in fact particles of debris created when the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city on 6 August 1945, towards the end of World War Two. \"The chemical composition of the melt debris provides clues to their origin, particularly with regard to city building materials,\" the authors wrote. In other words, the bomb turned buildings into dust, heat from the explosion reshaped that dust, and the blast ultimately spread this material across the nearby landscape \u2013 marking it forever.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nRemnants of nuclear explosions are not confined to the outdoors. They may be in your attic, too. Attic dust often lies undisturbed for decades \u2013 unlike urban soil, which is more likely to be disturbed \u2013 so traces of contaminants may remain.\nA study published in 2003 reports the results of a survey of 201 homes in the US state of New Jersey. Among the traces the researchers found there were lead concentrations that roughly correlated with the prevalence of lead in air pollution during the 20th Century. But they also found small amounts of Caesium-137, a radioactive isotope. This was more common the older the property was and could perhaps be explained, the researchers suggest, by the frequency of above ground nuclear weapons tests in the US \u2013 especially during the 1950s and 1960s.\nSiano and his colleagues are now looking further afield in their search for clues of human history embedded in nature. The team has collected more than 120 sediment cores from nine different countries around Europe, with the hope of finding further correlations between historical events and trace DNA or metal contamination left in those cores.\u00a0\n\"We can look for the impacts of the Vesuvius volcano [eruption] in Naples,\" says Siano, noting that the volcano last erupted in 1944. And here, as in other locations, the team may also detect signs of radioactive material ejected during the Chernobyl disaster \u2013 contamination from the accident having spread to over 40% of Europe.\u00a0\nAnd in yet more places, says Siano, evidence of everything from oil spills to the development of oyster farms may have been locked away in the sediment. \"We have all the material to answer these questions,\" he says.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature. If we aren't, well, we probably don't really believe something is inherently better because it's natural.\nMeanwhile, there are hundreds of things that we might consider not to be natural that, in fact, have made life quite a lot better for many of us. Prior to modern medicine, more than one in 100 women died in childbirth. In wealthy, industrialised countries such as the UK today, it is more like one in 10,000. Before vaccinations were rolled out globally, whooping cough (pertussis) killed one out of every 10 children infected. After the global roll-out, deaths fell to a fraction \u2013 1/157, specifically \u2013 of what they had been before.\nThat's just medicine. Look around you right now, and you'll see a dozen more examples. It's may not be \"natural\" to wear glasses, refrigerate food, or turn on the heating in winter, for example \u2013 but for many of us, it's a better alternative than walking around near-blind, leaving meat to spoil or shivering in the cold.\nMuch of the food we eat does not come to us as nature presents it. We process and cook it. The harvesting, grinding and processing of grains helped to drive the transition of our species from being nomadic hunter gatherers into settled farmers capable of building sophisticated civilisations. So, too, did the way in which we cultivated and cross-bred crops \u2013 meaning that many of the nutritious foods we consider \"natural\" today, from the orange carrot to the modern banana, look (and taste) far different than their wild forebears.\nOf course, it would be wrong to suggest that human-made products don't also cause us problems, whether pollution from synthetic plastics to the use of guns and explosives. Nor does it mean that, in many cases, the more \"natural\" option is not better for us. But it does mean that we cannot assume the more \"natural\" option is better just because it's natural \u2013 despite a frequent tendency for people to believe the contrary. Carrots might be better for us than crisps, but so too is paracetamol versus arsenic.\nSome of these examples hint at one of the other main problems with the \"appeal to nature\" \u2013 how can you delineate what is, and what isn't, natural at all? Humans, after all, come from nature. So, if anything an animal or plant produces is \"natural\", why isn't anything that humans do? And what of those creations that are blends of what we'd traditionally consider natural and man-made \u2013 like vaccinations, which are derived from the parts of a (natural) virus or bacteria, and, when injected, help teach your immune system how to (naturally) fend off that same pathogen in the future?\n\"Like all truly interesting words, 'nature' is a mille-feuille of meanings,\" writes the science historian Lorraine Daston. It can mean almost anything, depending on the context. This slipperiness, of course, is exactly what makes it such clever language for marketing \u2013 and makes it so easy for us to fall for.\nThere's another problem, too: even if there were a clear-cut delineation between \"humans\" and \"nature\", we're often not very good at knowing what is actually synthetic, versus what is not.\nTake brushing our teeth. Is it natural to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste? What about to brush your teeth with a non-fluoride toothpaste?\nFor many of us, our instinct might be to say that brushing with fluoride is unnatural, while brushing with non-fluoride toothpaste is natural. But fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that can be found in soil, water and rocks, while one of its common replacements in \"natural\" toothpastes, nano-hydroxyapatite, is synthetic. And, of course, we'd need to consider that cleaning one's teeth, certainly with the items we use today, is far from natural; the closest primates get to brushing their teeth is \"flossing\" with whatever is on hand (like bird feathers). Even if we wanted to brush our teeth the way that our human ancestors did, we'd need to scrub our teeth with a twig, pig hairs or even porcupine quills.\nMeanwhile, if I told you that I had made a drink for you that was made up of 99% dihydrogen monoxide, would you recoil? This chemical name sounds pretty synthetic, after all, until you think about it.\nDihydrogen monoxide is, of course, two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. You might be more familiar to see it written in chemical shorthand: H2O. In other words, water.\nThe next time you see a product being marketed on the basis that it is natural \u2013 or see someone arguing against something because it is not \u2013 it is worth questioning what is really being meant. And, perhaps, questioning why it is that those behind the product or practice are leaning on the \"appeal to nature\" fallacy to persuade an audience of its merits \u2013 rather than simply laying out the logical argument for just why it is actually the better option.\n* Amanda Ruggeri is an award-winning science and features journalist.

        "article_text": "How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nA popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: \"I don't care about Levy, he doesn't care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski.\"\nProminent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: \"Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed\" and \"24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change\".\nA crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.\nThe debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.\nFan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.\nClub sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.\nTottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.\nA 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\nLast week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.\nAmong those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.\nBBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.\nSome of the key points made were:\nLevy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structures\nHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide away\nAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially\nClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals\nSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies.\nA banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy's tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the \"most profitable club in Premier League history\" because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a \"degree of caution\" on transfer spending.\nHe describes Spurs as a \"superb cash-making machine\" who have \"outperformed any other club in England\".\nMaguire outlined:\nHis figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made \u00a3171m profit. Burnley were second on \u00a3159m, with Arsenal third on \u00a3105m\nIn the past decade, Spurs have the sixth-highest total wage bill in the Premier League (\u00a31.6bn vs Man City's \u00a32.9bn as the highest); the sixth-highest transfer spend (\u00a31.3bn vs Chelsea's \u00a32.8bn as the most); with the fifth-highest net spend over a similar period\nTottenham fans pay among the highest season ticket prices and matchday prices in the top flight\nLevy has the highest chief executive pay of Premier League clubs that declare such data. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned \u00a36.6m.\nDaniel Levy has been Tottenham's chairman since 2001\nClub insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham's progress under his leadership.\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be \"very ruthless\" but \"genuinely wants the best for Spurs\".\nThey claimed some of the \"own goals\" - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not \"surround himself with the best people\". \nThey described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as \"people too similar to him\" who will \"sit with their heads in their phones\", rather than \"people who make up for [Levy's] weaknesses\".\nThe source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: \"One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot.\"\nWhile Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".\nAnother source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".\nThey added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.\nFrom the archive: Inside Levy's 20 years at Tottenham (2021)\nPostecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy?\nIs Postecoglou's style causing Tottenham's injury crisis?\nSources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. \nThey say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table.\nWhile Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner.\nThat means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say.\nDuring the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club.\nOther sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League's highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated \u00a350m-plus over his 25 years in charge.\nThis week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs' ownership situation played it down.\nIn 2023, when Paris St-Germain's owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\nOne source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \"more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement\" - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates.\nVarious reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn.\nChelsea were bought in a deal worth up to \u00a34.25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was \u00a32.5bn with a commitment to spending \u00a31.75bn over the next 10 years.\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for \u00a31.03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to \u00a35bn for 100% of the club.\nDespite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential.\nAccording to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new \u00a31.2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was \"all-consumed\" and the board \"left everyone to do their jobs\". \nSpurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.\nThat source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.\nPaul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.\nIt could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".\nAnother source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".\nThey said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.\nHowever, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. \nOne criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.\nLevy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".\nThey are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.\nThe source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.\nThey added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.\nIt was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".\nSources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. \nThey will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation.\nTottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.\nIt is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models.\nSpurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the 'traditional top six' are either richer or bigger.\n\"We don't make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don't apologise at all,\" Levy said at September's fan forum.\n\"We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we've got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we're looking for.\"\nIn a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United's 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. \nThey believe a \"vocal minority\" of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change.\nThey added: \"Spurs haven't got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come.\"\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Ticket sales for Beyonc\u00e9's highly-anticipated Cowboy Carter tour seem to have gone without a hitch, with many fans expressing surprise at how easy the process was.\nIn contrast to the chaos surrounding Oasis and Taylor Swift's tours, online queues were kept to a minimum, and most people found the tickets they were looking for.\n\"I was in straight away, only 600 in front of me,\" wrote one fan on Reddit. \"I was able to find floor tickets for London even 30 min[utes] after general sale opened,\" added Shivam Arora on X. \"Not bad, to be honest.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9's six UK dates at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in June will be her first shows since 2023's record-breaking Renaissance Tour. \nTicketmaster said prices ranged from \u00a371 to \u00a3950, but cheaper tickets were also available direct from the stadium's own website.\nThe BBC was able to access Ticketmaster's page shortly after tickets went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Friday; and found tickets available in almost every section.\nThe stadium map slowly greyed out as seats were snapped up - but prices remained static, suggesting that \"dynamic pricing\" was not in place.\nNone of the dates were completely sold out at the time of writing, although in some cases only single seats remained.\nBeyonc\u00e9's tour launched on a massive day for concertgoers - with tickets also becoming available for Ozzy Osbourne's final gig with Black Sabbath plus Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Patti Smith, Beck, Morrissey, Mumford & Sons, Razorlight and Smashing Pumpkins.\nOne fan told the BBC they were willing to pay up to \u00a32,000 to attend Black Sabbath's charity concert in Birmingham, which will also feature performances from Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax, Gojira and members of Guns N' Roses.\n\"This really is Ozzy's final show with Sabbath,\" said Alex Woodford. \n\"I know it sounds crazy but I would be willing to pay silly money for it because it's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime show.\"\nBritish Beyonc\u00e9 fan Ben Archer, who has attended all of her concerts since 2014's Mrs Carter World Tour, was among those who secured tickets. \"She is the one artist I'm determined to see every time she tours,\" he told the BBC.\nEleven years ago, he paid \u00a360 for a standing ticket. This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nIt had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".\nVance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".\nThe Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.\nBut Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.\nHe alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.\n\n\nMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".\nVance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.\nHe raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.\nThe safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.\nBut Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.\nVance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.\nIn response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".\nNine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIn the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties.\n\"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. \"There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, later shared parts of his speech on X, praising it as \"excellent\".

        "summary": "German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".Vance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".The Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.But Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.He alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.Analysis: Vance's blast on Europe ignores Ukraine and defence agendaA quick guide to JD VanceUkraine end game: What each side wants from a peace dealMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".Vance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.He raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.The safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.But Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.Vance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.In response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".Nine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.In the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties. JD Vance attacks Europe over free speech and migration50 minutes agoEmily AtkinsonBBC NewsWatch key moments from Vance's speech in MunichUS Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".It had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. The two reportedly met afterwards, according to German public broadcaster ZDF.In his own speech, Pistorius directly addressed Vance, saying: \"Democracy was called into question by the US vice-president for the whole of Europe. \"All RO [Romanian] authorities are committed to organising free and fair elections by empowering citizens and guaranteeing the freedom to vote,\" he wrote on X.Vance later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the conference, which has otherwise mainly focussed on Russia's full-scale invasion.Zelensky said during the meeting that more work was needed on planning to end the fighting, while Vance said the pair shared a \"fruitful\" conversation.Trump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich, but Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the summit.Leaders set for key security meeting as 'old' world order at risk of crumblingMore work needed to stop Putin, Zelensky says at summit meeting with VanceTrump wants peace.",

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools.\n\"But what do you favour, the character of the man or someone who can pass off both hands at 16? There is good out of both.\"\nIf English rugby is short of the former, it could start looking in less familiar settings.\n\"There are thousands out there like me,\" says Genge of the state system's untapped talent.\n\"But until we open our doors to all the kids and give them the absolutely necessary tools and resources, we are going to keep having this conversation.\"",

        "article_text": "Despite the hype, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Washington under Donald Trump's second term was a sober, business-first affair - unsurprising for a working visit, which lacks the pomp of a state visit.\nTrump announced expanded US military sales to India from 2025, including F-35 jets, along with increased oil and gas exports to narrow the trade deficit. Both sides agreed to negotiate a trade deal and finalise a new defence framework. \nHe also confirmed the US had approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman accused of playing a role in the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai.\n\"That's a lot of deliverables for an administration less than a month old,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington told the BBC\n\"Overall, both sides seem comfortable continuing Biden-era collaborations, particularly in tech and defence, though many will be rebranded under Trump.\"\nStill, major challenges lie ahead. Here are the key takeaways:\nModi's visit came as Trump ordered that US trading partners should face reciprocal tariffs - tit-for-tat import taxes to match similar duties already charged by those countries on American exports. He ordered advisers to draft broad new tariffs on US trade partners, warning they could take effect by 1 April.\nIndia enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. India cut average tariffs from 13% to 11% in its federal budget in a bid to pre-empt Trump's tariff moves. \nThe jury is out on whether India appears to have dodged tariff shocks for now.\nAjay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI), says he doesn't see any \"problems with tariffs\".\nThe main reason, he says, is that 75% of the US exports to India attract import taxes of less than 5%.\n\"Trump points to extreme outlier tariffs like 150% on select items, but that's not the norm. India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.\nAbhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced.\n\"The devil lies in the details. Reciprocal tariffs won't just mirror India's import taxes -other factors will come into play,\" he told the BBC.\nTrump's approach could go beyond import duties, factoring in value added tax (VAT), non-tariff barriers and trade restrictions. While India's goods and services tax (GST) on imported goods aligns with WTO rules, Trump may still use it to justify higher tariffs.\nA US government memo on reciprocal tariffs hints at this strategy, citing costs to American businesses from non-tariff barriers, subsidies and burdensome regulations abroad. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.\nMr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected under WTO rules. \n\"This will hamper India's ability to prioritise domestic producers, posing a direct challenge to the 'Make in India' initiative. This is certainly not good news for us.\" \nMr Das suggests that India should counter Trump's reciprocal tariff logic, particularly in agriculture where the US imposes strict non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian exports such as stiff maximum residue limits on chemicals. \nHe argues that since the US \"heavily subsidises\" its farm sector, India should highlight these subsidies to push back against American claims.\nTariffs alone may not help bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. Defence and energy purchases will go some way in addressing the deficit, experts say.\nThe new $500bn (\u00a3400bn) trade goal aims to more than double the $190bn trade between the two countries in 2023.\nModi and Trump committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. Talks will focus on market access, tariff reductions and supply chain integration across goods and services.\n\"The announcement that the two sides will pursue a trade deal gives India an opportunity to negotiate for reduced tariffs on both sides. That would be a boon not only for the US-India relationship, but also for an Indian economy that's sputtered in recent months,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nWhat is not clear is what kind of trade deal the both sides will be aiming at.\n\"What is this trade agreement? Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?\" wonders Mr Srivastava. \nMr Das believes we'll have to wait for details on the trade agreement. \n\"It doesn't necessarily mean a free trade deal - if that were the case, it would have been stated explicitly. It could simply involve tariff reductions on select products of mutual interest.\"\nPriyanka Kishore, principal economist at the Singapore-based consultancy firm, Asia Decoded, says $500bn is a \"tall target but there are low hanging fruit we can immediately exploit\".\n\"For instance the US sanctions on Russian shadow fleet are soon going to kick in, so India can easily pivot to the US for more oil. This will not be too difficult.\"\nTrump said at the joint press conference that the US would hopefully become India's number one supplier of oil and gas. \nIndia's defence trade with the US has surged from near zero to $20 billion, making the US its third-largest arms supplier. \nWhile Russia remains India's top source, its share has dropped from 62% to 34% (2017-2023) as India shifts toward US procurement.\nIn a major announcement to deepen defence ties, Trump said the US would increase military equipment sales to India \"by many billions of dollars starting this year\" ultimately paving the way to providing the F-35 stealth warplanes.\nBut this will be easier said than done, say experts.\n\"This sounds good, but it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nDespite rising US arms sales to India, bureaucratic hurdles and export controls limit the transfer of sensitive technologies, he says. The new defence framework announced at the summit may help address these challenges.\nAlso India isn't \"taking the F-35 offer seriously\" due to high maintenance demands, says strategic affairs expert Ajai Shukla. \nShukla notes that US arms deals come with challenges - private firms prioritise profit over long-term partnerships. \nYet with delays and cost overruns affecting some of India's arms deals with Russia, Delhi's defence ties with the US look set to deepen.\nModi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss AI and emerging tech, India's foreign ministry said.\nIt's unclear if they addressed Musk's stalled plans for Starlink's India launch or Tesla's market entry. \nMusk has pushed for direct spectrum allocation, clashing with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who favours auctions. His licence remains under review.\nIndia is also courting Tesla to set up a car factory, cutting EV import taxes for automakers committing $500m and local production within three years. Tesla has yet to confirm its plans.\nIn a rare move, Modi joined Trump at a press conference, answering two questions - on illegal immigration and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) bribery charges against the Adani Group.\nIndian billionaire Gautam Adani, accused of close ties with Modi, was charged with fraud in the US last November over an alleged $250m bribery scheme. \nModi said he hadn't discussed the issue with Trump. On immigration, he stated India was ready to take back verified illegal Indian migrants.\nThis was only Modi's third direct press Q&A in his almost 11-year tenure as India's prime minister. He has never held a solo press conference. In 2019 he sat beside then party president Amit Shah as Shah answered all the questions and in 2023, he took just two questions alongside former President Joe Biden.",

        "summary": "The jury is out on whether India appears to have dodged tariff shocks for now.Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI), says he doesn't see any \"problems with tariffs\".The main reason, he says, is that 75% of the US exports to India attract import taxes of less than 5%. India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.AFPIndian and US soldiers rappel from a chopper during a joint exercise in Rajasthan - Trump says he wants India to buy more US weaponryMr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected under WTO rules. Here are the key takeaways:Did India dodge the reciprocal tax bullet?Modi's visit came as Trump ordered that US trading partners should face reciprocal tariffs - tit-for-tat import taxes to match similar duties already charged by those countries on American exports. Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?\"",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "summary": "Netflix chief: Emilia P\u00e9rez controversy a 'bummer'21 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesGasc\u00f3n has said she \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\"A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.Tweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.The Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.In a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.In an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".Her statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.Netflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.Changing the promotional postersNetflixGasc\u00f3n featured prominently in early promotional posters such as this oneAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.But an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent. \"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.The CNN interviewGetty ImagesGasc\u00f3n (pictured on a US chat show in January) has released several statements since the tweets came to lightGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.Pulling out of eventsGetty ImagesThe film's cast had previously attended events such as the Golden Globes togetherGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.However, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.And that's not all. Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-starsNetflixGasc\u00f3n's co-star Zoe Salda\u00f1a is the favourite to win best supporting actressEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group. I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.",

        "article_text": "Thousands of Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers are logging off during peak hours on Valentine's Day in a campaign for better pay and working conditions, a union says.\nThe strike action is taking place across the UK from 16:00 to 22:00 GMT.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would unite \"drivers up and down the country faced with low pay and insecure conditions\". \nUber, Bolt and Addison and Lee have defended their working conditions after the IWGB said drivers in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Brighton were backing the strike.\nVasilica Dumitrescu has been working for various platforms, including Uber and Bolt, for the last nine years. The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

The email noted that those who declined the offer could not be given full assurances that their jobs would not be eliminated.\nThe unions also said there was no guarantee that those who took the offer would get a full eight months of pay because Congress, which appropriates such funds, had not approved government funding beyond mid-March. \nAfter initially granting an injunction pausing the program, Judge O'Toole said that the unions do not have the \"required direct stake\" in the issue to challenge it in court.\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the ruling.\nIn a statement, AFGE National President Everett Kelley called the ruling a \"setback\" but said that the union's lawyers were assessing next steps.\n\"We continue to maintain it is illegal to force American citizens who have dedicated their careers to public service to make a decision, in a few short days, without adequate information, about whether to uproot their families and leave their careers for what amounts to an unfunded IOU from Elon Musk,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. \n\"I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences.\"",

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney.

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through.

Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured.\nThe released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State.\nThese armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds.\nThe Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948.\nOn Tuesday, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army. \nThe warrants included Saw Chit Thu, the Karen warlord who struck a deal in 2017 with a Chinese company to build Shwe Kokko, a new city believed to be largely funded by scams.\nThe BBC visited Shwe Kokko at the invitation of Yatai, the company which built the city. \nYatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko.

Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured.The released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State.These armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds.The Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948.Thai News PixThe scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and ChineseOn Tuesday, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army. But we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one.Like the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military.Under pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories.The DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers. Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko.",

        "article_text": "Thousands of Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee drivers are logging off during peak hours on Valentine's Day in a campaign for better pay and working conditions, a union says.\nThe strike action is taking place across the UK from 16:00 to 22:00 GMT.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would unite \"drivers up and down the country faced with low pay and insecure conditions\". \nUber, Bolt and Addison and Lee have defended their working conditions after the IWGB said drivers in cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Brighton were backing the strike.\nVasilica Dumitrescu has been working for various platforms, including Uber and Bolt, for the last nine years. The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. The release clause can be triggered for \u00a3145m before the final year of his contract and then goes down to \u00a383m.\nJust last week, it was revealed Kane also possesses certain release clauses that can be triggered before the respective ends of the January transfer windows to initiate a move for the summer.\nAs valuable as the England captain has been in his role as Bayern's top-notch goalscorer, the 31-year-old is obviously not seen as a long-term solution for Bayern, with an eventual return to the Premier League - where Kane could eventually break Alan Shearer's goalscoring record - appearing likely.\nMeanwhile, Musiala is 10 years younger than Kane and the perfect representative for Bayern, who have always been anxious to assemble the best German players, mixed with a number of high-profile talents from abroad.\nMusiala has already created countless moments of magic for Bayern, including his championship-clinching goal against Cologne in May 2023, when the team snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund during the final minutes of the season.\nMusiala played for England's youth teams but opted to represent Germany, the country of his birth\nWhen Musiala misses games or can only play a limited number of minutes due to an injury, his absence has been felt as the team does not look the same at all.\nBayern's 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Uefa Champions League earlier this season was a prime example.\nMusiala himself has talked about how he can be almost obsessed with improving his game through repetition and specialised training, for example practising certain shooting positions and movements.\n\"I just try to do everything that can take me to the next level,\" he said in 2023. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.\n\"I try to start at a young age with nutrition, the extra work so I can have more stamina, and then season by season, hopefully I get better.\"\nThere can be no doubt he has improved, instead of just resting on his natural talent as a footballer, and can do even further to put his name high among the world's best players in the future.\nIt is the reason why Musiala has just signed the most lucrative contract extension in German Bundesliga history.\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'",

If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.\nBut several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.\nA vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.\nThe tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.\nThe properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.\nThe government says that the waqf boards are among India\u2019s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).\nMuslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. \nBut critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies \u2013 which too requires immediate attention.\nA report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. \nThe committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.\nThe committee also noted that \u201cencroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common\u201d, listing hundreds of instances of such \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d of waqf land by government authorities.\nAccording to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.\nThe amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.\nParliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.\nBut many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.\nMany of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.\nThe 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.\nProfessor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.\n\u201cYou can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,\u201d Prof Rehman says.\nOthers worry that the new bill may not address the community\u2019s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.\nThat's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. \nSome agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. \nBut the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. \u201cThere seems to be an attempt not only to get the state\u2019s control over Muslims\u2019 properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community\u2019s lives.\u201d\nAmong other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf\u2019s claim to a property is valid.\nCritics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.\nThe current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.\nBut some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. \n\"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,\u201d Owaisi recently told reporters.\nThis process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.\n\u201cThe diagnosis may be correct,\u201d Prof Rehman says, \u201cbut the treatment is not.\u201d",

That now has to be a priority.\nIs the Chiefs' front office not bringing in the right draft picks and free agents? Is it a coaching blindspot on Reid's staff? These questions need answering.\nMahomes was sacked and hit more times than any other season in his career, while the Chiefs now have the top two pressure rates allowed when not even being blitzed in Super Bowl history.\nThat means the opposition can get to Mahomes without sending extra men so can still cover his receivers. It's a combination that will not only stop them winning more Super Bowls but also puts his health at risk.\nThe Chiefs have a huge commodity at quarterback, it's time they started protecting their star asset.\nSteve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defence was the only bright spot as they shackled Saquon Barkley. Yes, the Eagles scored 40 points, but the Chiefs' defence had some short fields to guard after turnovers and spending so long out there, the unit did well considering. \nSo there could be an overreaction here.

Now we can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on an issue that threatens it.\n\"Many, many leaders have talked about Europe that needs its own military - an army of Europe.\"\nThe concept of a European army has been proposed by other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron who has long backed the bloc's own military to reduce its reliance on the US.\nThe idea was quickly rebuffed by the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.\nZelensky said: \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin.

        "article_text": "Sainz (right) joined Williams after he lost his seat at Ferrari to Lewis Hamilton\nWilliams drivers Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon say it is wrong to threaten Formula 1 drivers with bans for swearing.\nSainz, who has moved to Williams from Ferrari, said he did not agree with the move by governing body the FIA to codify a system that can mean drivers are fined or suspended for swearing or criticising officials.\nAlbon, who is entering his fourth season with the team, added that the drivers had already spoken privately about how to respond to the move.\n\"There have definitely been discussions about it,\" Albon said. \"It's still ongoing about how we want to set out what we say around it. It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings. They already tell us what to say on the radio.\n\"But when you hear that passion, those words, even if sometimes we swear on the radio, for me that's a keeper in F1 and it is something we shouldn't get rid of.\"\nThe FIA has not explained how the new system will be applied, but last year president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said he wanted to stop drivers swearing while driving.\nSainz said the drivers have not had any clarification from the FIA.\nHe and Albon both drove Williams' new 2025 car as it was unveiled at Silverstone on Friday.\nVerstappen restricts answers after 'ridiculous' swearing punishment\nFerrari's Leclerc fined for swearing in news conference\nF1 drivers ask FIA to treat them like adults\nSainz explained that his first impressions were \"positive\", and he said Williams' willingness to host a day for media and sponsors and give the car its debut at the same time was indicative of the progress the team had made.\nLast year, the team struggled at the start of the season as attempts to introduce new processes in the team delayed the car build. A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

        "article_text": "Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time. \nStarting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings.\nThe collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dal\u00ed's friend and publisher.\n\"Dal\u00ed was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,\" Ms Argillet told the BBC.\nSome of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests.\nDal\u00ed's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. \nIn his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. \n\"Appreciating Dal\u00ed's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,\" Ms Argillet says.\nBringing Dal\u00ed's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition.\n\"The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,\" Ms Aggarwal says. \nStrictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dal\u00ed's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist.\nIn 1967, Dal\u00ed famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers.\nIn return, Dal\u00ed demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed.\nShe finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dal\u00ed had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out).\nDal\u00ed's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality.\nBorn in Spain in 1904, Dal\u00ed grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Andr\u00e9 Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dal\u00ed.\nThe surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by Andr\u00e9 Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was \"dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason\", according to Breton.\nDal\u00ed was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges.\nConsequently, Dal\u00ed's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. \n\"Dal\u00ed was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,\" Ms Argillet says.\nThe artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dal\u00ed revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache.\n\"Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,\" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache.\nIn the same interview, he described his moustache as being \"very gay, very pointed, very aggressive\".\nMs Argillet, who knew Dal\u00ed intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dal\u00ed being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and \"shocking the bourgeois\".\nHe once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover.\n\"At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,\" Ms Argillet says. \nBut she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dal\u00ed's shyness that made him over-perform in public.\n\"He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dal\u00ed, just like his paintings,\" Ms Argillet says.\n\"The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dal\u00ed.\"\nThe exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March.\nThis article has been updated to reflect that two Dali colour etchings are at Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city.",

        "article_text": "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.\nCheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.\nNow, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.\n\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.\n\"That's what we want.\"\nMr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.\nProductions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.\nThe loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.\nBefore the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.\n\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"\nHollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.\nMany say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA. \nBut studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.\nStudios are, however, very responsive to A-list actors.\nMegastar Vin Diesel helped ensure Universal Pictures would finish filming the latest Fast and Furious movie in Los Angeles.\n\"LA really, really, really needs production to help rebuild,\" Diesel said in an Instagram post.\n\"Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago\u2026 and now Fast will finally return home.\"\nNearly 20,000 people \u2013 including actors Keanu Reeves, Zooey Deschanel and Kevin Bacon \u2013 have signed a \"Stay in LA\" petition urging the state's leaders to temporarily remove caps on production tax incentives for LA County.\nIt's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.\n\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.\nBefore the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.\nHe says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.\nIf passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.\nPresident Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".\nIt's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.\nOn a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.\n\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.\nAlthough he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.\nMs Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.\n\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"\nOthers think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.\nPointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.\nHis once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.\n\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.\nAbout a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.\nShe laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.\n\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.\nMs Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.\n\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"\nDoes she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?\n\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.\nOn Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.\nIn outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.\nWhile big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.\nThe memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days. \nTrump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April. \nTrump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.\n\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".\n\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"\nAs well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports. \nTrump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.\nStill, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"\nIn recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.\nAhead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".\n\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good. \nCountries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nHistorically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium. \nThe US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.\nIn setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US. \nThe White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.\nBut officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax. \nThose kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK. \nDuncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus. \n\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said. \n\nThursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration. \nEarlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.\nHe also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March. \nShares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced. \nJohn Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".\nBut he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy. \n\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.\nHowever, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves. \nHe does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation. \n\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said. \nHe noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.\n\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.\nTrump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.\n\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"\nBut surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households. \nA recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats. \n\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".\nReporting contributed by Tom Espiner",

        "article_text": "The \"very slow-burn\" new series of the satire about a luxury resort is uneven and disappointing.\nLook closely at the opening credit sequence of this season's White Lotus, set at a luxury resort on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand. The camera roves over colourful drawings depicting centuries-old scenes of the landscape and culture, but soon the images of Buddhist shrines and elephants amidst flowered greenery give way to angry monkeys and shipwrecked men being eaten by sea creatures.\nThat ominous pattern reflects the plots of every season of The White Lotus. But unlike the credit sequence and the previous two instalments, the rest of this very slow-burn season doesn't get to the danger nearly fast or vividly enough. A series should never move so slowly that it only begins to take off halfway through. The White Lotus still has writer and director Mike White's fingerprints, and occasionally his iconoclasm and inventiveness. But this uneven iteration feels flabby and elongated, with far less satiric bite.\nAs before, this season starts with an unidentified corpse, after gunshots interrupt a meditation session with the resort's so-called \"health mentor\". So much for the Eastern spiritual calm some of the rich Western travellers might have hoped for. The story then flashes back a week as the guests arrive.\nThe show always skewers the ultrarich while heading toward the murder, so it makes sense that the most intriguing characters are a wealthy financial advisor and his family, even though the jabs at their privilege are toothless. Tim Ratliff finds himself in serious, predictable business trouble back home, but Jason Isaacs makes the character's desperation visceral and urgent. His wife, Victoria (Parker Posey), is a one-note character always zonked out on anti-anxiety drugs.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Instagram wellness guru who faked cancer\n\u2022\u00a011 of the best TV shows to watch this February\n\u2022\u00a0In an age of distrust spy thrillers are booming\nWhite's astute casting often makes the season better than the story suggests, though, and the Ratliff children are especially well played. The middle child, earnest Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), has led the family to Thailand so she can research her college thesis on Buddhism, one of the few plot points that actually has to do with Thailand. The oldest son, Saxon, is a good-looking, sex-obsessed dolt. Patrick Schwarzenegger effectively channels the layers of this bro-guy whose hedonism comes back to bite him. Sam Nivola plays the youngest child, shy high-school senior Lochlan. If you get the unsettling sense that the sexual boundaries in this family are a little too loose, trust your instincts. White provides a twist that is both ick and proof that he hasn't entirely lost his edge or willingness to plumb some dark psychology. The Ratliff brothers' casting might seem to cry nepo-baby because Patrick is Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver's son, and Nivola's parents are Alessandro Nivola and Emily Mortimer. But both are entirely natural and convincing, worth casting on their own.\nIn another smart, unexpected choice, Walton Goggins from Fallout plays the enigmatic Rick, whose garish shirts and unkempt appearance make him out of place at the resort. He seems to be some kind of grifter with a younger, put-upon girlfriend (Aimee Lou Wood). But for once Goggins is not asked to grin wildly, and becomes poignant when Rick's ulterior motive is revealed \u2013 if you believe his story.\nAnd Natasha Rothwell returns as Belinda, the spa manager in Maui in the first season, now in Thailand for job training in wellness. Rothwell has always made the character touching, with a sweet diffident smile that signals how little she expects from life. Here she is used mostly as a plot device, but it's a clever plot full of call-backs to earlier seasons and too spoilery to detail.\u00a0\nBy far the weakest storyline involves three long-time friends on a girls' trip. Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb's roles are shockingly cliched, including jealousy, gossip and a holiday fling with the help. Near the start, Coon gulps a whole glass of wine, typical of the mugging and telegraphing of characters in a thread that is meant to be the most comic but just seems stale.\u00a0\nWith so many possibilities, it's disappointing that the show doesn't use its setting well. It just cuts away to a shot of a monkey or a statue of a monkey now and then. And although the premise is full of built-in cultural and class differences, the Thai characters are marginal and shallow. Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink, plays Mook, a member of the wellness staff who has little to do except smile and flirt with the security guard at the resort's entrance.\nSome major themes come to the fore as the eight-episode season winds down, especially when Piper visits a Buddhist monastery. But by the end of episode six, the last one sent to critics, the season is still just an echo of the previous ones. A fourth season has already been ordered, so The White Lotus has a chance to right itself, but maybe not in Thailand.\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Everton fans greet their team before the final Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Goodison Park\nGoodison Park is one of the grand sporting theatres, and the final Merseyside derby played out at the old place delivered the dramatic last act it deserved before the doors are finally locked.\nThe concluding scenes included a 98th-minute equaliser from James Tarkowski, only given after the stadium held its breath for several minutes while the video assistant referee checked for offside and a foul.\nAnd then, when the goal was awarded to give Everton a deserved 2-2 draw, tempers boiled over with Abdoulaye Doucoure needlessly taunting Liverpool's fans, to the annoyance of Curtis Jones, sparking a full-on brawl that saw both sent off.\nThey were followed by Liverpool head coach Arne Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff, who were furious with referee Michael Oliver, as this derby descended into chaos with police, stewards and players all involved.\nEverton manager David Moyes said: \"It was mayhem all game. A bit of a throwback. The place was boiling hot all night. It was an incredible atmosphere.\"\nAnd in those few words, Moyes summed up the special magic of Goodison Park.\nIt may be creaking in parts, but on fiery nights like this with Liverpool as the opposition, it literally rocks - parts of it really do - with a glorious support and naked hostility like few other places in world football.\nEverton may have that state-of-the-art new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock ready to go next season, but it is an almost impossible task to replicate what they have in this place - ramshackle and old-fashioned in parts admittedly, hence the need to move.\nGoodison Park was never going to go quietly, but this was something else - full of emotion, passion and all the wild scenes of indiscipline Moyes called \"to-ing and fro-ing\" after the final whistle.\nIt may have pillars blocking some of the views, but it still has so much that will be missed with its towering Main Stand and the criss-cross designs on the stands that are the trademark of famous Scottish architect Archibald Leitch.

        "article_text": "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.\nSea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.\nBut as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.\nThis latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.\nOver the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).\nThis breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.\nArctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.\nThe decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.\nBut until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.\nSince then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.\n\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.\n\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"\nAntarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.\nBut warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.\nThe Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.\n\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"\nAntarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.\nAt the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.\nBut current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.\nThis is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.\nAs well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.\n\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.\nIn recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.\nThis \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.\nThis very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.\nBut, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.\nThe Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.\nDeclining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.\nPolar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.\n\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.\nSea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.\n\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.

But Clement will surely know a poor result at Tynecastle will nudge him closer to an exit.\nSix weeks ago he might have fancied his side's chances of earning a morale-boosting victory, but Neil Critchley has steadily improved Heart of Midlothian since taking time to assess the squad.\nThey have won four of their five league games in 2025 - with one draw - which is as many victories as in their final 22 matches of 2024.\nCammy Devlin has been pivotal to their resurgence. He tops the table for the number of tackles (23) as well as being joint-top for interceptions in the Premiership in 2025. \nTo get at Hearts' defence, first you have to find a way past the Australia defensive midfielder. His availability after a concussion at St Mirren on Monday could well be key to this game.\nThe loan signing of Belgian striker Elton Kabangu seems to have liberated Lawrence Shankland too, and the Jambos showed the sort of resilience that was sorely lacking earlier in the season when they edged past the Buddies in the Scottish Cup.\nYet, despite the cloud hanging over Clement, Rangers have won each of their past four league games - and all by a margin of at least two goals. It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.\nHistory is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.\nRangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.\nThat record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.\nThis video can not be played\nMOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'\nThird-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.\nThat said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.\nSo, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.\nCould that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?\nHe has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.\nPerhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.\nMight Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?\nIf he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?\nThis video can not be played\nHighlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline Athletic\nEvery new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.\nIt usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.\nThen Thelin pitched up. \nThe Dons had chased the Swede for a long time before landing him and it soon became clear why they had been so patient. Ten wins from their first 11 Premiership games at the start of the season and a dramatic point at Celtic led to talk of a title challenge.\nThelin had somehow turned largely the same squad that saw off Neil Warnock within eight games into one that seemed poised to push Celtic into the new year.  \nHis stock went through the roof and there was even gossip linking him with ambitious Birmingham City.\nBut if his stock rose rapidly, it has dropped even more quickly. Aberdeen have lost eight and drawn one of their past nine league games - as many defeats as in their previous 37 games.\nThey have gone from putting pressure on Celtic in second to fourth - just five points ahead of eighth. Thelin, incredibly, is under serious pressure for his job within two months of being touted as Fergie 2.0.\nHis tactics and style of play have been criticised, with suggestions other teams have now worked him out.\nThe good news for him is the Dons play Dundee next.\nAberdeen's last league win was against Dundee, three months ago, and the last time they won an away league game was against Dundee, almost five months ago.\nTony Docherty's side have conceded more goals (53) and faced a higher expected goals against total (46.1) than any other side in the Premiership this season. \nThey have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. \nOh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.\nAberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. \nHe will know that if he doesn't, he then faces exacting matches against former Dons boss Derek McInnes' new side Kilmarnock, Celtic and third-placed Dundee United.",

Oh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.Aberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. They have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. Rangers' trip to Tynecastle on Sunday is therefore eagerly awaited - and so too is Aberdeen's game against Dundee, with Jimmy Thelin also remarkably feeling the heat.There are calmer waters at Celtic, but the biggest game of their season looms large.Here are a few things to look out for this weekend...Game of the weekend - Hearts v RangersClement will perhaps be surprised he is still in charge at Ibrox after the embarrassing Scottish Cup exit against Queen's Park.With Rangers failing to mount a title challenge, the defeat against the Spiders has turned up the heat significantly on the Belgian.Rangers' hierarchy have been tight-lipped all week, which is a backing of sorts.",

        "article_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas. \nModi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\nWhile both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\". \nThe Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US. \nAt a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.\n\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".\nTrump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries. \n\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.\nWith India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC. \n\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said. \nHowever, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said. \n\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit. \nTrump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets. \nThe two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".\nModi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US. \nLast week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday. \n Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\nShortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.\nHe acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".\nTrump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.\n\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"\nThe White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.\nThe document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.\n\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said. \n\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"\nTrump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic. \nHe has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. \nEarlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs.",

They keep goats - primarily to make cheese and occasionally for meat - as well as chickens, grow their own vegetables and manage the site's woodland.\nThe building runs off hydropower and a tiny wind turbine and is heated by a log burner. \nThey host weekly Welsh language classes, run workshops, open days and volunteer weeks to demonstrate their way of life.\nMany in the community have jobs away from the farm, they eat communally five times a week and, before the community's families left ahead of the eviction notice, the children were home-schooled.\nWill and the other members each pay rent as well as their contribution to \"food club\", bills, and a savings pot for expenses such as building repairs. \nWith no-one in charge, decisions are made collaboratively and their shared values include inclusivity, gratitude and valuing learning and culture. \nDoes living in this way come with the occasional conflict?\n\"There absolutely are difficulties at times,\" admitted Will.\n\"Occasionally conflicts happen... but there are far fewer than there are beautiful times.\"\nHe said the community tried to take blame out of conflict.\n\"A conflict for me is when we find a glitch in the way in which we're working, no-one's at fault,\" he said.\nHe said \"detangling\" conflicts when there was no-one in charge was \"very deep and intense work and often very painful, but by the end of it we find ourselves stronger, more beautiful, able to act with each other in a more beautiful way\".\nRosie Gilam, who grew up in nearby Cardigan, is Will's partner and spends about three days a week with him at Brithdir Mawr.\nShe has been visiting the community since she was a child and previously lived in communities in Cornwall. \n\"A major wonderful thing about being human is to accept others for what they are, understand they've got their own needs which might not intersect completely with your needs, and to come to a place where you're accepting of your differences and find a way to work together,\" she said.\n\"I think that is so needed on the planet at the moment.\" \nLike Will, she insisted \"nobody's to blame\" for the community's current predicament. \nShe said the situation was an example of \"broken systems\" which meant \"tenants don't have rights, a family can be turfed out of its home with little notice, and that people generally don't have affordable access to land\". \nShe hopes media attention on Brithdir Mawr will start a conversation about land rights and be \"one step towards systemic change\". \n\"So for example, there might be community right to buy, which means that a community like this in the future would have the right to buy an asset,\" she said.  \nAndromeda Gervasio, who is from Portugal, moved to the UK 12 years ago, and moved to Brithdir Mawr last summer after feeling burnt out with city life, \"craving a different lifestyle\" and being drawn to \"intentional community\".\n\"The water is the purest water I've ever drank, and the food is the best food I've ever eaten,\" they said.\n\"People are here not just because, there's a bigger purpose of really living together and sharing the work that it is to live and to live in a place like this... it's pretty incredible.\"\nThey said they cherished being accepted in the countryside. \n\"Being a queer person in the rural landscape has always been something that I was generally scared about... and then actually discovering it and feeling incredibly safe here, I've been so grateful... and I think that I owe lots to Brithdir in that regard,\" they said.\nLike the rest of their community, Andromeda insisted they did not feel animosity towards the new owner. \n\"We're not up against a particular person but a system and a normalised way of going about things,\" they said.\n\"Just because someone has the legal backing to do something, it doesn't necessarily make it okay or how the world should be.\n\"We have a history of things that were within legal bounds not corresponding to what is morally OK to do... [denying] women's rights, slavery and queer witch hunts were all legal at some point.\"\nFor now, what will happen next for the community is uncertain.  \n\"Essentially I feel really, really sad about it,\" said Rosie. \nShe lives in hope of all parties sitting down together and looking for a solution \"with an open heart\". \nWill is confident a resolution can be found.\n\"I don't know exactly what that would look like and that's OK,\" he said. \n\"This complexity and this difficulty feels very difficult, feels gnarly and unpleasant, but also I truly believe that something very special is happening.\n\"I look forward to this process continuing and resolving in a way that works for everyone in the near future.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.\nOn Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.\nIn outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.\nWhile big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.\nThe memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days. \nTrump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April. \nTrump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.\n\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".\n\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"\nAs well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports. \nTrump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.\nStill, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"\nIn recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.\nAhead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".\n\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good. \nCountries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nHistorically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium. \nThe US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.\nIn setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US. \nThe White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.\nBut officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax. \nThose kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK. \nDuncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus. \n\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said. \n\nThursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration. \nEarlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.\nHe also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March. \nShares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced. \nJohn Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".\nBut he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy. \n\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.\nHowever, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves. \nHe does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation. \n\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said. \nHe noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.\n\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.\nTrump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.\n\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"\nBut surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households. \nA recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats. \n\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".\nReporting contributed by Tom Espiner",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's future is the focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), just days after a shock phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the Ukraine war.\nDescribing the call earlier this week as \"great\", Trump said there was a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war\". \nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country must not be left out of any peace talks.\nEuropean allies seemed surprised at the nature of the call, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning that any peace agreement which involved capitulating to Russia would end \"badly for everyone\".\nIt is still unclear when peace negotiations could begin, but when they do issues around territory, security negotiations and Ukraine's future in Nato will be among the key topics for discussion. Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena. \nKay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".\nOne heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".\nAnother had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.\nThe woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".\nBBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".\nThe incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.\nWith this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.\nLarry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".\n\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.\n\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"\nLast year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".\nWhen discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.\n\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply. \n\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"\nDean recalls his shocked response. \n\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" Dean tells the BBC.\nThe Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.\n\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!\n\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"\nHis second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.\nArenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.\n\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.\nHe says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.\n\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"\nAnother British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".\nDean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.\nBut, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.\nAbi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.\nCrucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.\n\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.\n\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\" \nNew comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as an MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.\nFor Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.\n\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.\n\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!\n\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"\nClarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.\n\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"\nThe other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.\n\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"\nShe's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.\n\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"\nHer new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.\nDuring these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".\nWelsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.\nIt's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant. \nHe sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.\n\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.\n\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"\nStag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.\nHilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.\n\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"\n\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.\n\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"\nHe will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certian \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.\nBut it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".\n\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"\nNine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".\nAnd the one that does, \"might have had a bad day, drank too much or they might just be an [idiot]!\n\"I think it's something within people, we like a bit of drama.\"",

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature. If we aren't, well, we probably don't really believe something is inherently better because it's natural.\nMeanwhile, there are hundreds of things that we might consider not to be natural that, in fact, have made life quite a lot better for many of us. Prior to modern medicine, more than one in 100 women died in childbirth. In wealthy, industrialised countries such as the UK today, it is more like one in 10,000. Before vaccinations were rolled out globally, whooping cough (pertussis) killed one out of every 10 children infected. After the global roll-out, deaths fell to a fraction \u2013 1/157, specifically \u2013 of what they had been before.\nThat's just medicine. Look around you right now, and you'll see a dozen more examples. It's may not be \"natural\" to wear glasses, refrigerate food, or turn on the heating in winter, for example \u2013 but for many of us, it's a better alternative than walking around near-blind, leaving meat to spoil or shivering in the cold.\nMuch of the food we eat does not come to us as nature presents it. We process and cook it. The harvesting, grinding and processing of grains helped to drive the transition of our species from being nomadic hunter gatherers into settled farmers capable of building sophisticated civilisations. So, too, did the way in which we cultivated and cross-bred crops \u2013 meaning that many of the nutritious foods we consider \"natural\" today, from the orange carrot to the modern banana, look (and taste) far different than their wild forebears.\nOf course, it would be wrong to suggest that human-made products don't also cause us problems, whether pollution from synthetic plastics to the use of guns and explosives. Nor does it mean that, in many cases, the more \"natural\" option is not better for us. But it does mean that we cannot assume the more \"natural\" option is better just because it's natural \u2013 despite a frequent tendency for people to believe the contrary. Carrots might be better for us than crisps, but so too is paracetamol versus arsenic.\nSome of these examples hint at one of the other main problems with the \"appeal to nature\" \u2013 how can you delineate what is, and what isn't, natural at all? Humans, after all, come from nature. So, if anything an animal or plant produces is \"natural\", why isn't anything that humans do? And what of those creations that are blends of what we'd traditionally consider natural and man-made \u2013 like vaccinations, which are derived from the parts of a (natural) virus or bacteria, and, when injected, help teach your immune system how to (naturally) fend off that same pathogen in the future?\n\"Like all truly interesting words, 'nature' is a mille-feuille of meanings,\" writes the science historian Lorraine Daston. It can mean almost anything, depending on the context. This slipperiness, of course, is exactly what makes it such clever language for marketing \u2013 and makes it so easy for us to fall for.\nThere's another problem, too: even if there were a clear-cut delineation between \"humans\" and \"nature\", we're often not very good at knowing what is actually synthetic, versus what is not.\nTake brushing our teeth. Is it natural to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste? What about to brush your teeth with a non-fluoride toothpaste?\nFor many of us, our instinct might be to say that brushing with fluoride is unnatural, while brushing with non-fluoride toothpaste is natural. But fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that can be found in soil, water and rocks, while one of its common replacements in \"natural\" toothpastes, nano-hydroxyapatite, is synthetic. And, of course, we'd need to consider that cleaning one's teeth, certainly with the items we use today, is far from natural; the closest primates get to brushing their teeth is \"flossing\" with whatever is on hand (like bird feathers). Even if we wanted to brush our teeth the way that our human ancestors did, we'd need to scrub our teeth with a twig, pig hairs or even porcupine quills.\nMeanwhile, if I told you that I had made a drink for you that was made up of 99% dihydrogen monoxide, would you recoil? This chemical name sounds pretty synthetic, after all, until you think about it.\nDihydrogen monoxide is, of course, two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. You might be more familiar to see it written in chemical shorthand: H2O. In other words, water.\nThe next time you see a product being marketed on the basis that it is natural \u2013 or see someone arguing against something because it is not \u2013 it is worth questioning what is really being meant. And, perhaps, questioning why it is that those behind the product or practice are leaning on the \"appeal to nature\" fallacy to persuade an audience of its merits \u2013 rather than simply laying out the logical argument for just why it is actually the better option.\n* Amanda Ruggeri is an award-winning science and features journalist.

You're entitled to your opinion.\nBut what's not in doubt is that they all went viral on YouTube, which is now 20 years old.\nIt's become the place where 2.5 billion people log on monthly to kill time, be entertained and, sometimes at least, learn something.\nBut it's also been life-changing for some of its breakout stars, like Charlie.\nYou wouldn't recognise him now but millions around the world have watched him, as a baby, chomping on his big brother's digits. \nThat's because he's the star of Charlie Bit My Finger.\n\"It was never not a part of my life, it's always been there,\" Charlie, who's now 18, tells BBC Newsbeat.\nThe 55-second clip has had almost 900 million views since it was uploaded in 2007.\nCharlie says he can't remember the moment, filmed when he was \"about one\" and sitting on Harry's lap.\nHe says the clip's success has made life \"easier\" and helped him get to university where he now studies law.\nHis dad Howard Davies-Carr previously told Newsbeat the family had made an estimated \u00a31,000,000 off the video over the years.\nThe video was sold as a non-fungible token, or NFT, for \u00a3500,000 in 2021.\nBut Mr Davies-Carr said he wanted to keep the boys \"very grounded\" in how they live their lives.\nCharlie shares that view and says he doesn't play the \"don't you know who I am?\" card.\n\"It's not like I use it as an icebreaker or anything,\" he says. \n\"I was never going to use this as a fun fact.\"\nCharlie says he doesn't want to be seen as a show-off, so when asked about himself volunteers \"something else a bit more boring\".\n\"But my friends like to tell people [sometimes], so it's hard keeping it locked down,\" says. \n\"It slips out every now and then.\n\"And people are like: 'Oh that's cool', for like five minutes. Or they say: 'I don't know what that is.'\"\nYouTube was founded on 14 February 2005 by three friends - Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim - all former employees of the online payment system PayPal.\nWhile the first video published on 23 April 2005 was not quite Baby Shark, it did have an animal theme. \nIt was a 19-second clip called Me at the zoo, posted by co-founder Jawed.\nThe founders opened the first YouTube headquarters in an office above a California pizza restaurant.\nIt is now owned by Google and has offices all over the world.\nIn the UK, 82% of adult internet users in the UK have reported using the platform - more than WhatsApp (80%), Facebook (76%) and Instagram (57%).\nNow YouTube is a destination many choose for the latest trailers, reviews and news.\nBut it is music videos which dominate the most-viewed list, with Baby Shark Dance having more than 15 billion watches.\nDespacito by Luis Fonsi has more than eight billion, Shape of You by Ed Sheeran has more than six billion views and PSY's Gangnam Style has 5.4 billion.\nAnd while Charlie's family has been helped by income from YouTube, some of its biggest names have made a fortune.\nAmerican YouTuber MrBeast, a.k.a Jimmy Donaldson, is the most popular YouTuber with more than 360 million subscribers.\nBusiness magazine Forbes estimates that he earned $85 million (\u00a368 million) in 2024, making him the highest-paid creator.\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing in the platform's two decades.\nFact-checking organisations around the world have previously said that YouTube is not doing enough to prevent misinformation on the platform.\nThe site has also been punished for privacy violations, being fined $170m (\u00a3139m) by a US regulator for violating children's privacy laws.\nIn 2023, it was accused of collecting the viewing data of children aged under 13, in breach of a UK data privacy code.\nAnd there has been criticism that, like other online platforms, violent and extremist videos have been available to view despite government calls for their removal.\nJournalist Tamzin Kraftman, who covers technology news, feels while the platform has managed to stay relevant against competition from TikTok and Instagram, there are challenges with combating things like misinformation.\n\"No team can go through everything with a fine-toothed comb,\" she says.\n\"So the question is how they will ensure everything on there is correct and within regulations.\"\nTamzin tells Newsbeat AI could play a big role in helping to deal with those issues, but \"might get things wrong and could ban the wrong channel\".\n\"I think it's how they use new tools to really stop the spread of misinformation that is going to be their golden ticket [going forward].\"\nAnd Charlie doesn't think the platform is \"dying out\" any time soon, years on from his flutter with fame.\nWhile he doesn't remember loads from then, he is grateful for the opportunities it has brought.\nHe has managed to travel \"a decent amount\" and been to the United States, filming a flight-safety video.\nAs for whether he's tried to recreate the bite?\n\"I haven't since I was very young.\n\"I could start charging now.

        "article_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas. \nModi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\nWhile both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\". \nThe Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US. \nAt a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.\n\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".\nTrump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries. \n\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.\nWith India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC. \n\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said. \nHowever, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said. \n\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit. \nTrump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets. \nThe two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".\nModi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US. \nLast week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday. \n Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\nShortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.\nHe acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".\nTrump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.\n\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"\nThe White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.\nThe document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.\n\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said. \n\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"\nTrump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic. \nHe has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. \nEarlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs.",

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that...

According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

Hoping and praying that you'll bag tickets for Beyonc\u00e9's upcoming Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour.\nAll of that doesn't leave you much time to think about the meaning behind the name. \nCowboy Carter is, obviously, the name of Beyonc\u00e9's latest album. \nBut \"Chitlin' Circuit\" might raise some questions in your mind.\nFrom the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.\nIt meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces. \nDuring this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.\nKnown as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.\nVenues were considered safe and acceptable spaces for black musicians, comedians and audiences and gave many pioneering performers a platform to hone their craft.\nAlmost every notable black musician of the time graced the circuit at some point, including stars such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Jimi Hendrix and James Brown.\nThe circuit was \"tremendously important to the development of black music\", says Mia Bay, Professor of American History at Cambridge University.\n\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat. \n\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.\n\"They were on the road all the time.\" \nProf Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".\nPerformers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says. \n\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.\n\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.\n\"[It] was very much a segregated state, so this would be something that would be a very direct reference in terms of where she grew up and how she thinks about American history.\n\"I also think she, in some ways, has a nostalgic reference, because it was such a communal circuit with a lot of performers,\" she says.\nThe star's latest tour stops off at notable Chitlin' Circuit cities such as Houston and Chicago.\nBeyonc\u00e9 fan and music history content creator Nat Brown feels that's not a coincidence.\nUnlike Renaissance, this tour is smaller with only eight cities being played in total globally, with six of those in the US.\n\"It's a very small tour,\" says Nat.\n\"Just like it historically was with the Chitlin' Circuit, where you only went to seven to 10 places.\n\"And if people were able to see you - great. But most often, people missed out because you blazed through town and went to the next spot.\"\nShe thinks the purpose of using \"Chitlin' Circuit\" as part of the title is to educate people who may not know about it.\nBeyonc\u00e9's previous album, Renaissance explored the forgotten influence of black and queer communities on house music. \nAnd Cowboy Carter, which recently won a best album Grammy, delves further into the history of black American musicians.\nNat says: \"I think it's bringing back something old and making it new again.\n\"This is bringing something to younger generations.\n\"Being able to see your favourite artist play and things like that and really have that bonding and kind of cultural experience.\n\"That's what she's trying to bring back,\" Nat says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

        "article_text": "David Moyes has led Everton to four wins in six league games since returning to the club\nOne point clear of the Premier League relegation zone and with just three wins in 19 matches, Everton were in a perilous position when David Moyes was reappointed as manager on 11 January.\nA little over a month later, however, the Merseyside club are suddenly the in-form team in the top flight.\nSaturday's victory at Crystal Palace means Moyes has picked up 13 points since returning to Goodison Park - with no team having secured more in that time (Arsenal are also on 13).\nThe Scot's tally of four wins in six league matches is also more than his predecessor Sean Dyche managed in the 19 games before his dismissal.\nThat stunning resurgence has lifted Everton 13 points above the bottom three, and only seven points below the top half, with 13 games of the 2024-25 season left to play.\nIt would take an extraordinary set of results for the Toffees to slip back into the relegation picture, and fans can surely start to look forward to watching top-flight football at their new stadium on Bramley Moore Dock next season.\n\"It was a great win because for large parts we weren't at our best,\" Moyes told BBC Match of the Day after the 2-1 victory at Selhurst Park. \"I thought Crystal Palace were on top, but thankfully we got the three points.\n\"Everton have had a difficult period, but I certainly think there's light at the end of the tunnel now.\"\nAlcaraz scores late winner for Everton at Palace\nThis video can not be played\nLight at end of tunnel for Everton - Moyes on new owners\nEven the most optimistic Everton supporters could not have expected such a remarkable revival under Moyes, who took charge of more than 500 games during an 11-year spell at the club between 2002 and 2013.\nBefore his return, the Toffees had managed only 15 goals in 19 league matches - the fourth-lowest tally in their history - while their expected goals (xG) tally of 18.33 was the lowest in the division.\nIn just six league games under Moyes they have already managed 12 goals - from an xG of 8.12.\nThat improvement is made all the more impressive by a personnel crisis that left them without nine first-team players against Palace, including Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Iliman Ndiaye and the suspended Abdoulaye Doucoure - who missed the trip to London after his celebrations in front of Liverpool supporters led to him being shown a red card at the end of Wednesday's dramatic Merseyside derby draw.\n\"Since the manager has come in we have definitely improved,\" defender James Tarkowski told Sky Sports. \"Winning and scoring goals brings [the belief] back.\n\"We were low on numbers today, with all the emotions of Wednesday [but] we stuck at it and got the win.\"\nWhen asked to shed light on Everton's upturn in form, Moyes said: \"I don't know if there's any secret.

        "summary": "'What a week' - in-form Everton's revival under Moyes keeps rollingImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, David Moyes has led Everton to four wins in six league games since returning to the clubMatthew HowarthBBC Sport journalistPublished8 hours ago328 CommentsOne point clear of the Premier League relegation zone and with just three wins in 19 matches, Everton were in a perilous position when David Moyes was reappointed as manager on 11 January.A little over a month later, however, the Merseyside club are suddenly the in-form team in the top flight.Saturday's victory at Crystal Palace means Moyes has picked up 13 points since returning to Goodison Park - with no team having secured more in that time (Arsenal are also on 13).The Scot's tally of four wins in six league matches is also more than his predecessor Sean Dyche managed in the 19 games before his dismissal.That stunning resurgence has lifted Everton 13 points above the bottom three, and only seven points below the top half, with 13 games of the 2024-25 season left to play.It would take an extraordinary set of results for the Toffees to slip back into the relegation picture, and fans can surely start to look forward to watching top-flight football at their new stadium on Bramley Moore Dock next season. \"Alcaraz scores late winner for Everton at PalaceToffees rediscovering scoring touchThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Light at end of tunnel for Everton - Moyes on new ownersEven the most optimistic Everton supporters could not have expected such a remarkable revival under Moyes, who took charge of more than 500 games during an 11-year spell at the club between 2002 and 2013.Before his return, the Toffees had managed only 15 goals in 19 league matches - the fourth-lowest tally in their history - while their expected goals (xG) tally of 18.33 was the lowest in the division.In just six league games under Moyes they have already managed 12 goals - from an xG of 8.12.That improvement is made all the more impressive by a personnel crisis that left them without nine first-team players against Palace, including Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Iliman Ndiaye and the suspended Abdoulaye Doucoure - who missed the trip to London after his celebrations in front of Liverpool supporters led to him being shown a red card at the end of Wednesday's dramatic Merseyside derby draw. \"In-form Beto firing when it mattersNo player epitomises the Toffees' improvement quite like Beto, who continued his fine form with another goal at Selhurst Park.The Guinea-Bissau striker's opener in south London was his fourth goal in three league games - as many as he managed in 42 matches under Dyche.The 27-year-old joined Everton from Udinese in August 2023 for a fee reportedly worth up to \u00a330m, but scored only three goals in 30 top-flight appearances as he struggled to adjust to life in England.After opening his account for the 2024-25 campaign in a 1-1 draw with Fulham in October, Beto then went nine league games without a goal before netting a double at home to Leicester City earlier this month.He sent Goodison Park wild with a calmly taken opener in the derby before opening the scoring at Palace with a similarly composed finish.With a hamstring injury ruling out Calvert-Lewin for the rest of the season, Beto could hardly have picked a better time to hit a purple patch. \"Everton's league results since Moyes' return15 January: Everton 0-1 Aston Villa19 January: Everton 3-2 Tottenham25 January: Brighton 0-1 Everton1 February: Everton 4-0 Leicester12 February: Everton 2-2 Liverpool15 February: Crystal Palace 1-2 EvertonRelated topicsPremier LeagueEvertonFootballMore on this storyLatest Everton news, analysis and fan viewsGet Everton news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022 \"When asked to shed light on Everton's upturn in form, Moyes said: \"I don't know if there's any secret.",

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.",

        "article_text": "The Afghan women's team who will not be silenced\n\"Don't do anything until I get back!\"\nMel Jones was in the middle of a television commentary, but she was also in the middle of masterminding an escape from the Taliban.\nThe former Australia cricketer was one of the three women who organised and funded ways for the Afghanistan women's cricket team to flee their country in 2021 in what she said felt at times like \"a Jason Bourne movie\".\nAmong the 19 players who made the terrifying journey to Australia was Firooza Amiri, who shook with fear every time her family were stopped in the car at eight check points they had to pass on the journey out of their home country.\nTo this day, Amiri cannot fathom how their excuses of attending a \"family wedding\" and \"taking their mother to receive medical care in Pakistan\" were believed.\n\"It was the biggest miracle of my life,\" she told the BBC.\nThree and a half years later, she and her team stepped on to the field at the Junction Oval in Melbourne for an Afghanistan Women's XI who were playing their first ever match as another chapter in their remarkable story started.\nAmong those watching on emotionally from the sidelines was Jones, who set up what was dubbed a \"backyard immigration service\" to organise emergency humanitarian visas, money and safe passage for the players and their families.\nConsidering the dangerous journeys they had made, this was to be a day of overwhelming joy for the players who were finally back competing in the sport they love.\nBut the specially designed badge on their kits - rather than an official crest - was a big reminder that their fight to play remains far from over while the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not recognise them as a national side.\nIn a new documentary, 'Cricket's Forgotten Team', the BBC looks into the team's story by speaking with the players and those who played a crucial role in safely evacuating them.\nWatch Cricket's Forgotten Team on BBC iPlayer\nThis video can not be played\n\"I didn't know if we were going to live or die\"\nAmiri had been drinking tea at home with her grandmother in August 2021 when she heard that the Taliban had returned.\n\"In that moment I was shocked and I felt that I would lose everything,\" she said with tears in her eyes, adding that she knew immediately the team would need to leave the country.\n\"My parents lived through the first time that Taliban were in Afghanistan and they knew what would happen to the girls.\n\"I didn't know if I was going to survive. I didn't know if there was going to be a chance for me and my family to get out of Afghanistan, I didn't know if we were going to live or die.\n\"I burned everything, all my certificates, all my medals. There's nothing left.\"\nUnder Taliban laws, women are banned from universities, sport and parks. It is also forbidden for their voices to be heard outside of their homes.\nAmiri's team-mate Nahida Sapan recalled how the Taliban came to her home searching for her.\n\"My brother went outside and one of the Talib asked him, 'Do you know about some cricket girl? We think she lives here.' My brother was very scared. I had a scorebook for all of my team-mates so I went home and ripped all of the paper up and put it in the trash.\"\nSapan, whose brother worked for the previous government, said her family then started receiving calls and messages from the Taliban.\n\"They were direct threats. They were saying: 'We will find you and if we find you, we will not let you live. If we find one of you we will find all of you.'\n\"I was so worried about all of the team girls. We all needed a safe place.\"\nThat safe place was to come from an unlikely source on the other side of the world.\nThousands of miles away, Mel Jones was sitting in quarantine in an Australian hotel during the Covid-19 pandemic when she received a message from an Indian journalist asking whether she had heard about the Afghan cricket team's situation.\nThe players had looked to the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) for assistance after the Taliban took over but received none.\nOn their own, they were terrified under the rule of the hardline Islamist group.\nThe journalist put Jones in touch with one of the players and she asked if there was anything she could do to help. The player replied to say that all her team-mates and the backroom staff needed to get out of Afghanistan.\nJones, who won two World Cups with Australia, then went through her contact book and brought volunteers on board, including her friend Emma Staples, who used to work for Cricket Victoria, and Dr Catherine Ordway, who had helped to evacuate Afghan women footballers.\nCreating a tight network of people who could help, including on the ground in Afghanistan, they organised visas and transport to eventually get 120 people out of the country, mainly into Pakistan and then on military flights to Dubai. From there they flew to Melbourne or Canberra on commercial flights supported by the Australian government.\n\"I don't think I understood the enormity of what we were doing at the time,\" Staples said. \"We were told that we may not be able to save everyone.\n\"For me, it was co-ordinating what we joke about now as being a backyard immigration service. It was filing out visa documents, passport documents and trying to transfer money to Afghanistan for the girls to purchase passports.\n\"It was six weeks of gathering information from the family members, trying to get identification, but we just had this extraordinary spreadsheet that detailed everybody.\"\nShe said communication with the players was \"really challenging\" but \"nothing Google Translate couldn't fix\".\n\"We giggle now about the language barrier, I got called different names such as 'delicious' and some other odd things,\" Staples recalled with a smile.\n\"It all happened so quickly for them that I don't think they had time to think about what they've had to leave behind. I have no doubt that some of them are going through survivor's guilt.\"\nJones, 52, who now works as a cricket broadcaster, said there were moments when it was not clear that the mission would succeed.\n\"We had to fight the system when everyone kept saying it was impossible. Things were happening minute to minute,\" Jones said.\n\"Without sounding flippant, there were moments that felt like you were in a Jason Bourne movie,\" she said, recalling trying to commentate on television while also messaging a player who was struggling to find the right car that would take her to safety.\n\"She couldn't find the car and was going up to different people and I had to warn her you can't do that [for safety reasons], but then I had another commentary stint so I had to say 'don't do anything until I get back!'.\n\"That was the fearful part for me, just making sure they made the right decisions.\"\nEmma Staples (left), Mel Jones (centre) and Dr Catherine Ordway (right) were instrumental in getting the cricketers out of Afghanistan\nFor months after they landed in Australia, the female players kept their whereabouts a secret while they were living in temporary accommodation as they still feared for their safety.\nThe local cricket clubs they joined also helped protect their identities.\nThey waited until December 2022 and then wrote to the ICC to tell them they were living in Australia and to ask two big questions: what had happened to their contracts with the ACB and what had happened to the money that goes to the ACB that should be for their development?\nThey also requested that some of those funds be redirected to the players in Australia.\nAfter a month, the ICC replied to say that contracts were a matter for the ACB and that it was up to the board to decide how to spend the funds it receives from the global governing body.\nBut with the ACB refusing to engage with their female players, the team were left feeling like those at the top of sport had washed their hands of them.\nIn June 2024, in light of Afghanistan's men's team reaching the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, the women seized their moment to write a second letter to the ICC.\nThis time they asked to be allowed to form a refugee international team.\nThey say they have never received a response to that letter.\n\"It's so painful and so disappointing,\" said Shabnam Ahsan, who was just 14 when she fled her country. \"I don't understand why they [the ICC] are not doing anything to help us. We have worked so hard and we deserve help just like every other team.\"\nThe ICC told BBC Sport in a statement it \"remains engaged with the situation in Afghanistan, with the wellbeing and opportunities of players as our top priority\".\nIts chair Jay Shah added: \"We are committed to supporting cricket development through the Afghanistan Cricket Board while recognising the challenges facing Afghan women's cricket, including the concerns of players living in exile.\n\"The ICC is also reviewing certain communications concerning Afghanistan women's cricket and exploring how they can be supported within ICC's legal and constitutional framework. Our focus is on constructive dialogue and viable solutions that safeguard the best interests of all Afghan cricketers.\"\nFirooza Amiri (second from left) and her team-mates played their first match as the Afghanistan Women's XI last month\nRecords show Afghanistan had a women's cricket team in 2012 which folded shortly afterwards. It was then officially relaunched in 2020 when a talent camp led to 25 players being given contacts.\nHaving a women's team is part of the criteria required for a country to become a full ICC member and it means Afghanistan receives full funding and Test status.\nYet despite no longer having a women's team, the ACB still enjoys that full membership, a fact that has started to raise eyebrows around the world.\nEarlier this year, UK politicians wrote to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) calling for England's men to boycott their Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan on 26 February in protest at the treatment of Afghan women.\nThe ECB refused but called on the ICC to act, with chief executive Richard Gould writing to the global governing body to take action after what he called \"gender apartheid\".\nHe also called for Afghanistan's funding to be withheld until women's cricket is reinstated and support given to Afghan women's players.\nAmiri said she and her team-mates are \"proud\" of the Afghanistan's men's side. All they want is to be treated on the same terms.\n\"The ICC celebrates equality, but I don't know what equality they're celebrating,\" Amiri said. \"Afghanistan doesn't have a women's team and they are still giving the men's team the chance to play and funds.\n\"I am so angry. The ICC has never done anything for us.

        "article_text": "The Afghan women's team who will not be silenced\n\"Don't do anything until I get back!\"\nMel Jones was in the middle of a television commentary, but she was also in the middle of masterminding an escape from the Taliban.\nThe former Australia cricketer was one of the three women who organised and funded ways for the Afghanistan women's cricket team to flee their country in 2021 in what she said felt at times like \"a Jason Bourne movie\".\nAmong the 19 players who made the terrifying journey to Australia was Firooza Amiri, who shook with fear every time her family were stopped in the car at eight check points they had to pass on the journey out of their home country.\nTo this day, Amiri cannot fathom how their excuses of attending a \"family wedding\" and \"taking their mother to receive medical care in Pakistan\" were believed.\n\"It was the biggest miracle of my life,\" she told the BBC.\nThree and a half years later, she and her team stepped on to the field at the Junction Oval in Melbourne for an Afghanistan Women's XI who were playing their first ever match as another chapter in their remarkable story started.\nAmong those watching on emotionally from the sidelines was Jones, who set up what was dubbed a \"backyard immigration service\" to organise emergency humanitarian visas, money and safe passage for the players and their families.\nConsidering the dangerous journeys they had made, this was to be a day of overwhelming joy for the players who were finally back competing in the sport they love.\nBut the specially designed badge on their kits - rather than an official crest - was a big reminder that their fight to play remains far from over while the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not recognise them as a national side.\nIn a new documentary, 'Cricket's Forgotten Team', the BBC looks into the team's story by speaking with the players and those who played a crucial role in safely evacuating them.\nWatch Cricket's Forgotten Team on BBC iPlayer\nThis video can not be played\n\"I didn't know if we were going to live or die\"\nAmiri had been drinking tea at home with her grandmother in August 2021 when she heard that the Taliban had returned.\n\"In that moment I was shocked and I felt that I would lose everything,\" she said with tears in her eyes, adding that she knew immediately the team would need to leave the country.\n\"My parents lived through the first time that Taliban were in Afghanistan and they knew what would happen to the girls.\n\"I didn't know if I was going to survive. I didn't know if there was going to be a chance for me and my family to get out of Afghanistan, I didn't know if we were going to live or die.\n\"I burned everything, all my certificates, all my medals. There's nothing left.\"\nUnder Taliban laws, women are banned from universities, sport and parks. It is also forbidden for their voices to be heard outside of their homes.\nAmiri's team-mate Nahida Sapan recalled how the Taliban came to her home searching for her.\n\"My brother went outside and one of the Talib asked him, 'Do you know about some cricket girl? We think she lives here.' My brother was very scared. I had a scorebook for all of my team-mates so I went home and ripped all of the paper up and put it in the trash.\"\nSapan, whose brother worked for the previous government, said her family then started receiving calls and messages from the Taliban.\n\"They were direct threats. They were saying: 'We will find you and if we find you, we will not let you live. If we find one of you we will find all of you.'\n\"I was so worried about all of the team girls. We all needed a safe place.\"\nThat safe place was to come from an unlikely source on the other side of the world.\nThousands of miles away, Mel Jones was sitting in quarantine in an Australian hotel during the Covid-19 pandemic when she received a message from an Indian journalist asking whether she had heard about the Afghan cricket team's situation.\nThe players had looked to the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) for assistance after the Taliban took over but received none.\nOn their own, they were terrified under the rule of the hardline Islamist group.\nThe journalist put Jones in touch with one of the players and she asked if there was anything she could do to help. The player replied to say that all her team-mates and the backroom staff needed to get out of Afghanistan.\nJones, who won two World Cups with Australia, then went through her contact book and brought volunteers on board, including her friend Emma Staples, who used to work for Cricket Victoria, and Dr Catherine Ordway, who had helped to evacuate Afghan women footballers.\nCreating a tight network of people who could help, including on the ground in Afghanistan, they organised visas and transport to eventually get 120 people out of the country, mainly into Pakistan and then on military flights to Dubai. From there they flew to Melbourne or Canberra on commercial flights supported by the Australian government.\n\"I don't think I understood the enormity of what we were doing at the time,\" Staples said. \"We were told that we may not be able to save everyone.\n\"For me, it was co-ordinating what we joke about now as being a backyard immigration service. It was filing out visa documents, passport documents and trying to transfer money to Afghanistan for the girls to purchase passports.\n\"It was six weeks of gathering information from the family members, trying to get identification, but we just had this extraordinary spreadsheet that detailed everybody.\"\nShe said communication with the players was \"really challenging\" but \"nothing Google Translate couldn't fix\".\n\"We giggle now about the language barrier, I got called different names such as 'delicious' and some other odd things,\" Staples recalled with a smile.\n\"It all happened so quickly for them that I don't think they had time to think about what they've had to leave behind. I have no doubt that some of them are going through survivor's guilt.\"\nJones, 52, who now works as a cricket broadcaster, said there were moments when it was not clear that the mission would succeed.\n\"We had to fight the system when everyone kept saying it was impossible. Things were happening minute to minute,\" Jones said.\n\"Without sounding flippant, there were moments that felt like you were in a Jason Bourne movie,\" she said, recalling trying to commentate on television while also messaging a player who was struggling to find the right car that would take her to safety.\n\"She couldn't find the car and was going up to different people and I had to warn her you can't do that [for safety reasons], but then I had another commentary stint so I had to say 'don't do anything until I get back!'.\n\"That was the fearful part for me, just making sure they made the right decisions.\"\nEmma Staples (left), Mel Jones (centre) and Dr Catherine Ordway (right) were instrumental in getting the cricketers out of Afghanistan\nFor months after they landed in Australia, the female players kept their whereabouts a secret while they were living in temporary accommodation as they still feared for their safety.\nThe local cricket clubs they joined also helped protect their identities.\nThey waited until December 2022 and then wrote to the ICC to tell them they were living in Australia and to ask two big questions: what had happened to their contracts with the ACB and what had happened to the money that goes to the ACB that should be for their development?\nThey also requested that some of those funds be redirected to the players in Australia.\nAfter a month, the ICC replied to say that contracts were a matter for the ACB and that it was up to the board to decide how to spend the funds it receives from the global governing body.\nBut with the ACB refusing to engage with their female players, the team were left feeling like those at the top of sport had washed their hands of them.\nIn June 2024, in light of Afghanistan's men's team reaching the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, the women seized their moment to write a second letter to the ICC.\nThis time they asked to be allowed to form a refugee international team.\nThey say they have never received a response to that letter.\n\"It's so painful and so disappointing,\" said Shabnam Ahsan, who was just 14 when she fled her country. \"I don't understand why they [the ICC] are not doing anything to help us. We have worked so hard and we deserve help just like every other team.\"\nThe ICC told BBC Sport in a statement it \"remains engaged with the situation in Afghanistan, with the wellbeing and opportunities of players as our top priority\".\nIts chair Jay Shah added: \"We are committed to supporting cricket development through the Afghanistan Cricket Board while recognising the challenges facing Afghan women's cricket, including the concerns of players living in exile.\n\"The ICC is also reviewing certain communications concerning Afghanistan women's cricket and exploring how they can be supported within ICC's legal and constitutional framework. Our focus is on constructive dialogue and viable solutions that safeguard the best interests of all Afghan cricketers.\"\nFirooza Amiri (second from left) and her team-mates played their first match as the Afghanistan Women's XI last month\nRecords show Afghanistan had a women's cricket team in 2012 which folded shortly afterwards.

Here's where the different sides stand.\nMoscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the south and east.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe conflict then burst into all-out war nearly three years ago after Russia's full-scale invasion.\nMoscow's attempts to seize the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have since slowly expanded their territorial control, mostly in the east. \nUkrainian forces, supported by arms and equipment from the US and European allies, have made those advances as difficult as possible and have at times been able to retake territory, as well as stage a counter-offensive into western Russia. \nUkraine has always insisted any peace deal must include the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine back to the pre-2014 borders, including Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\"We will never recognise occupied territories as Russian,\" Zelensky said at a press conference during the MSC.\nRussia, on the other hand, has formally annexed four regions of east and south Ukraine and wants them to be recognised as part of Russia - despite not being in control of all the territory in those regions.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. However, the Kremlin swiftly ruled that out.\nUntil recently, Ukraine's western allies stood by Zelensky's position that all of Ukraine, including Crimea, should be returned. \nBut the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth poured cold water on those hopes, saying at a summit in February that achieving pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective\".\n\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" he said.\nUkraine wants to join Nato, arguing that the western military alliance - in which members pledge to defend one another if attacked - is the best way to ensure its security.\nFor Kyiv, Russia's full-scale invasion is proof that only Nato membership can guarantee its security. \nHowever, Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nAs he arrived for the MSC, Zelensky said Ukraine trusted Nato's security guarantees, before adding that he thought membership would be \"the cheapest option for everyone\". \nEurope needs to unite around Ukraine to protect itself, he added.\nNato members have consistently argued that Ukraine should become a Nato member in the future, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling Zelensky that the country is on \"an irreversible path\" to membership.\nBut those guarantees are now looking less solid, after the US defence secretary downplayed the likelihood of Nato membership for Ukraine in any peace settlement. \n\"The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth said. \nZelensky has said previous discussions with US President Donald Trump are \"definitely not enough to form a plan\" for peace.\nSpeaking as he arrived at the MSC, he said that signals coming from the US were \"strong\" but \"varied\".\nHegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces.\nMeanwhile, the US vice-president said sending troops to Ukraine is \"still on the table\" should Russia fail to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.\n\"The president is not going into this with blinders on,\" JD Vance told the told the Wall Street Journal.\nBack in October, Zelensky laid out his victory plan to Ukraine's parliament, which included key points like Nato membership, joint US and EU protection of critical natural resources, and the containment of Russia via a non-nuclear strategic deterrent package deployed on Ukrainian soil.\nThe US president at the time, Joe Biden, was given a briefing on this plan - as were then-presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. \nIt is unclear whether any part of Zelensky's plans will be taken forward to peace talks, but Hesgeth has warned there would be no US troops on the ground Ukraine in any future security arrangement.\nZelensky told the Guardian that he does not believe security guarantees without US involvement will work. \nUK defence sources quoted in the Times newspaper claim that the US could provide some form of air defence - possibly Patriot missiles - to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine in return for access to minerals.",

        "article_text": "Solitary lifestyles can have some big advantages in the animal world. Can humans learn anything from them?\nThe Middle East blind mole rat is the ultimate introvert. Residing about a foot underground, it digs out its own tunnel systems where it stays for most of its life, gathering roots, tubers, and bulbs. Each mole rat has its own territory \u2013 for good reason; if one mole rat accidentally burrows into another one's tunnel, the rodents will bare their teeth or bite each other in violent, often deadly battles.\u00a0\nBlind mole rats generally only interact with others of their species during the mating season, but even then, they must proceed cautiously. The male digs through the soil towards a female but pauses before entering her tunnel. For several days, they send vibrational signals to each other by drumming on the tunnel ceiling with their heads. Only when the female expresses an interest to meet will the male advance, mate with her, and leave. After closing the tunnel behind him, he continues his reclusive way of life.\nSolitary lifestyles such as this are remarkably widespread across the animal kingdom. Even among mammals \u2013 a generally sociable bunch \u2013 22% of studied species are largely solitary, meaning that males and females sleep and forage or hunt alone for most of the time.\nBut solitary animals have received relatively little attention from scientists. Perhaps because we are social creatures ourselves, we've been more drawn to studying creatures that cooperate in groups for protection or to find food, breed and raise young. Experts say that for a long time, many scientists have tended to overlook the solitary life, deeming it a more primitive, basic state of existence, associated with anti-social behaviour and poor intelligence.\u00a0\nBut researchers are now coming to recognise that some animals have evolved to be solitary precisely because it can be so beneficial to avoid the competition and stressful conditions of group living. To boot, many solitary animals are in fact highly intelligent and live diverse and complex social lives, despite their solitude. Though blind mole rats are an exception, many solitary animals do tolerate, learn from and occasionally even cooperate with others of their kind, allowing them to enjoy the best of both worlds.\nAs humans are increasingly spending more time alone, these animals remind us of the many benefits of solitude and that living alone does not equal lonely \u2013 a thought perhaps worth considering for people spending Valentine's Day alone.\n\"Maybe by studying solitary species and how they succeed with this tactic\u2026 we can also better identify for human society what is good about being alone,\" says behavioural ecologist Carsten Schradin of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique in Strasbourg, France, and co-author of a 2024 review about solitary living in mammals.\nLiving in groups certainly has many benefits. Think of zebras that find safety in herds and lions that often hunt together to overcome prey larger and faster than themselves. Some birds collaborate to raise young and chimps that socialise by picking parasites off each other. But it also has downsides. In a group, \"every shelter has to be shared, every bit of food has to be shared, every access to a mate has to be shared\", says David Scheel, a behavioural ecologist at Alaska Pacific University. \"Or if it's not shareable, only one of you can get it.\"\nAnd while hunting together and sharing food makes sense for animals like lions that are often surrounded by abundant, large prey that can feed multiple individuals, this is less beneficial in situations where prey is smaller and less shareable. Nor is it as helpful when prey is scattered throughout the landscape where it takes more effort to find them.\nThis is probably why armadillos and anteaters forage alone for few-and-far-between insects, and why tigers \u2013 which roam far and wide to find relatively scarce prey \u2013 hunt by themselves, helping them to sneak up on their prey more easily. To further reduce competition, tigers and some other solitary hunters form small territories that they defend from other predators.\nFor blind mole rats, solitude means not needing to constantly compete for tunnel space, which takes a lot of energy to dig. Solitary animals may also face less competition for mates and a reduced risk of contracting diseases and parasites. Meanwhile, young-raising females can invest all their energy into caring for their own offspring without having to tend to their neighbours' young, like some more social species do. For other creatures, like sloths, their camouflage may only work if they're not in large groups.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If you're solitary-living, you're less conspicuous,\" says Lindelani Mayuka, a zoologist from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa and co-author of the review with Schradin.\u00a0\nLiving alone does create other challenges \u2013 such as missing out on the benefit of huddling together to stay warm. But some animals like the bush Karoo rat of southern Africa get around this by building big stick lodges to protect themselves from temperature swings as well as predators, Mayuka says.\nFor highly social animals, being alone can be stressful \u2013 often leading to poor health and anxiety \u2013 but solitary animals do just fine. In fact, Middle East blind mole rats become stressed and anxious when they're placed next to one another, even if there's a barrier between them, with smaller, more submissive individuals suffering the most.\u00a0\n\"They can die from the stress that they have,\" says Tali Kimchi, a behavioural neuroscientist at the Weizmann Institute in Israel who studies the blind mole rats in her laboratory. Like all mammals, blind mole rat mothers tend to their offspring, but mums eventually become hostile, forcing their young to dig away from her tunnel. \"It sounds funny, but that's the survival of these creatures,\" she says.\nNot all solitary species actively repel each other. Many of them are drawn together by shared resources and have surprisingly rich social lives, tolerating each other and even cooperating when it makes sense. For example, bush Karoo rats that live close to related individuals have frequent, amicable interactions with one another \u2013 sharing foraging grounds with related females and sometimes even stick lodges at the end of the breeding season when there\u2019s a great demand for stock lodges.\n\"Just because some animals are solitary living does not mean that they do not have social interactions,\" Mayuka says.\nEven some octopuses \u2013 a group once considered so solitary it was a running joke that they'd only meet to mate or eat each other \u2013 sometimes aggregate, Scheel says. At one site in Jervis Bay in eastern Australia, individuals of a species called the gloomy octopus are drawn together by the availability of shelter. This probably started when one octopus piled up discarded shells after eating and these eventually stabilised enough of the sediment that another octopus could build its burrow inside. This new resident then created its own pile of discarded shells \u2013 until as many as 16 octopuses gathered on one spot, says Scheel, who has been studying the site with his colleagues.\nIn this \"octopus city\", individuals find themselves in a much more crowded situation than they are used to and exhibit curious behaviours to cope with others of their kind.\nMales sometimes try to coerce females into staying nearby and chase other males \u2013 occasionally crawling into each other's dens, wrestling with and evicting them. Sometimes when evicted males come back to their den, \"the evicting male may return and repeat the eviction\", Scheel says. And as they clean out their dens, the octopuses often push debris onto their neighbours' side. Sometimes, they hold the debris and use their funnels to blast it at one another, says Scheel, who documented some of these interactions in a 2022 paper.\nNeither aggressive nor cooperative, some scientists call these behaviours \"jostling\", says Scheel, who is still working out the purpose of these interactions. \"Here we've plopped a solitary animal into a complex social situation, and all they're doing is jostling, and they seem totally healthy. That suggests they're either less solitary than we thought, or the stresses of being [social] are not that severe [for them].\"\nThese sophisticated social interactions underscore the intelligence of solitary creatures. Similarly, researchers have seen some solitary reptiles closely watching other individuals and using that information to solve problems \u2013 an ability once thought to be unique to humans, says behavioural scientist Anna Wilkinson of the University of Lincoln in the UK. \"Animals who maybe wouldn't naturally form complex groups can actually have really quite sophisticated aspects of social learning,\" she says.\nIn experiments with red-footed tortoises, which forage by themselves but might encounter one another under fruiting trees, for example, Wilkinson presented them with a V-shaped, transparent fence with food on the inside. No animal could reach the food until Wilkinson and her colleagues trained one of them how to do it. Upon seeing their fellow reptile reach the food, the other tortoises immediately followed suit. It's especially remarkable to see that reptiles have the ability to learn from other individuals by imitation, considering that many of them have evolved to\u00a0hatch\u00a0from eggs without a parent around to teach them skills.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The linguist learning to speak 'cow'\n\u2022 The eerie ambassador from the abyss\n\u2022 Why some animals appear to mourn their dead\nEvidence like this is causing scientists to see solitary living not as a fixed, uniform category, but rather as a continuum: from animals like the (arguably) antisocial blind mole rat to species that live largely alone but learn from and cooperate with one another. Some species even blend solitary and more social lifestyles, like communally living striped mice that go solo once they start breeding, or raccoon-like coatis, whose males are solitary and females hunt in bands.\nStudying solitary animals and their social networks can help conservationists better protect and preserve their populations from human threats. Mayuka and Schradin have already started an effort to build a community of scientists to further decipher the lives, benefits, needs and challenges of solitary animals. \"Being solitary is not simple and primitive,\" Schradin says. \"It can be quite complex and provide challenges\u2026 which are solved in different ways by different species.\"\nUnderstanding the full breadth of solitary living could even be helpful for people. Kimchi is studying changes in the brains of blind mole rats as they switch between introverted and more social mating and pup-raising stages. Perhaps such research can help scientists understand how people with neurological or psychiatric conditions become socially withdrawn, she says.\u00a0\nBut solitary animals can also help us consider that being alone doesn't necessarily have to be problematic, even if it has been somewhat stigmatised in our extrovert-driven society, says Schradin. \"Social\" solitary animals construct meaningful social networks around them \u2013 and people living by themselves can, and do, too. \"Being alone,\" Schradin says, \"can also be the best choice for many humans.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\n\u00a0For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.\nRakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.\n\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.\nWhen Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.\n\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.\nHer teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.\nFor a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.\nA middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.\nThere was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.\nHowever, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.\nHe invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.\nWhen they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"\nCompetition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.\nOver time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.\nThey won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.\nRakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.\nThey missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.\nSimran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.\nBut in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.\nBut the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.\nSimran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.\n\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.\nSimran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.\nTheir first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.\n\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.\nBut by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.\nRiding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.\nBut Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.\nAlthough guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.\n\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.\nBoth Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.\nDespite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.\nRakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"\nThe BBC Indian Sportswoman Of The Year (ISWOTY) Award is back with its fifth edition to celebrate and honour the remarkable achievements of women athletes in India. Find out about the nominees - the winner will be announced on 17 February.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPlayer schedules leading to injuries - Arteta\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta says Kai Havertz's \"unexpected\" season-ending injury came when the striker blocked a shot during training. \nThe Germany forward will miss the remainder of the campaign after sustaining a hamstring injury during a winter training break in Dubai.\nHavertz will have surgery on the issue and is not expected to return until pre-season. \n\"He was going to stop a shot after a set-piece and stretched the leg and he felt his hamstring,\" Arteta said.  \n\"We were having a great camp in Dubai, recharging, training, having some time off and connecting again with nature and a different environment.\n\"And then the injury happened in a very unexpected way, certainly. So it's a big blow, obviously, because of the injuries that we have. \nHavertz joins Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli on the sidelines, leaving Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and teenager Ethan Nwaneri as the side's only recognised forwards.\nArteta has had to deal with a number of injury issues throughout the season, with the likes of Ben White, Martin Odegaard and Riccardo Calafiori all missing lengthy spells. \nIn September, Manchester City captain Rodri said players were 'close' to going on strike to protest against the increase in matches due to revamped Uefa competitions and a Fifa Club World Cup.\nA week later, he was ruled out for at least six months after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament. \n\"We've had players who are injured who've played 130 games in the last two seasons so it's an accident waiting to happen when you continue to load, load and load,\" said Arteta. \n\"The intensity is at a different level and the demands in terms of minutes in this competitive environment is getting higher and higher and it's a consequence of that. \n\"The amount of muscle and tendon injuries is higher than ever so there's a relationship.\n\"We're very limited and we're training less than ever. There's no time for training.\"\nWith the transfer window now closed, Arteta says he would consider signing a free agent to ease the club's injury crisis in attack. \n\"I'll explore every possible situation and make a decision from there,\" he said. \nThis video can not be played\nCan Ethan Nwaneri solve Arsenal's injury crisis?\nWatch The Football News Show's Premier League weekend preview\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone\nBen Dinnery, founder of Premier Injuries, says there has been a reduction in injuries this season compared to the previous campaign. \n\"The narrative is that injuries are going through the roof this season, but they are actually not,\" Dinnery told BBC Sport's Football News Show.\n\"In terms of time loss absence we've actually seen a reduction season on season over the same period compared to 2023-24 by roughly 13%.\"\nHowever, Dinnery says there has been an increase in muscle injuries such as hamstring strains. \n\"I's the type of injuries [getting more severe] and the length of return to play that is taking a little bit longer,\" said Dinnery. \n\"When we took the 2023-24 season in isolation, looking at the previous four on average, we've seen an increase in hamstring injuries, certainly at the severe end, by about 65%. \n\"By severe we mean hamstring injuries that are likely to keep a player out for more than 30 days.

It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

        "article_text": "Moments in human history are etched into the Earth. Now researchers are piecing together evidence of our impact on the planet \u2013 through the marks we've left on nature.\nThe microbes living in this French harbour have never recovered from World War Two. Between 2012 and 2017, Raffaele Siano pulled sediment cores from the seabed at Brest harbour, wondering what he was going to find. When he and his colleagues at the French Institute for Ocean Science (Ifremer), analysed the fragments of DNA captured in those cores \u2013 they discovered something remarkable.\nThe oldest, deepest layers of sediment \u2013 dating to before 1941 \u2013 had traces of plankton called dinoflagellates that were strikingly different to the genetic traces of plankton left in the shallower, more recent layers. \"There was a group, an order of these dinoflagellates, that was very abundant before World War Two \u2013 and after World War Two it almost disappeared,\" says Siano. He and his colleagues published a study detailing their findings in 2021.\nSiano mentions that Brest harbour had been bombed during the war. Then, in 1947, a Norwegian cargo ship exploded in the Bay of Brest. The disaster killed 22 people and spread ammonium nitrate, a toxic chemical used to make fertiliser and explosives, into the sea. Even younger sediment in the 1980s and 1990s showed further changes in the plankton community in the harbour. \"We correlated this from another type of pollution coming from intensive agricultural activities,\" says Siano.\nNature has a way of remembering things. Echoes of certain human activities, especially highly-polluting ones, sometimes show up in tree rings, coastal sediments and ecosystems. Arguably, these traces are hints of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch in which humanity is said to have irrevocably, and drastically, altered Earth. Human history, it turns out, is written into the very fabric of our planet \u2013 and the life that co-exists here with us.\nSiano and his colleagues are predominantly ecologists but they also work with historians. \"The land changed because of human impact and also because of historical events,\" Siano says. When the team analysed the sediment cores from Brest, they also detected a gradual rise in heavy metal pollution as time passed. Younger layers of sediment contained higher volumes of mercury, copper, lead and zinc, for example.\nThe report notes there were similar levels of some of these metals \u2013 especially lead and chromium \u2013 in Pearl Harbour, a major US naval base in Hawaii that was heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes in 1941. However, Siano adds that he can't be sure whether these metals came directly from the bombs themselves. Either way, there is a signal in both Brest and Pearl Harbour of a calamitous, and polluting, moment in human history.\nOther researchers have also scoured the planet in search of geological records of anthropogenic pollution. In China, soil sediments reveal a sharp increase in metal contamination since 1950 \u2013 which correlates with a rise in air pollution there during the second half of the 20th Century. A separate study explores how the emergence of industries such as shipbuilding may be linked with a higher incidence of heavy metal deposits in tree rings from certain parts of China.\nEven Roman metallurgy, from many centuries ago, has left its mark. One 2022 study found a noticeable rise in lead contamination in ice, sediment and peat cores from Europe, correlated with the development of Roman industry. It is sometimes difficult to be sure which specific events caused spikes in lead contamination, however, note the authors.\nJean-Luc Loizeau at the University of Geneva has studied the sediment of Lake Geneva, particularly the material found in a small area of the lake near to a wastewater treatment plant. He says the sediment there contains many traces of human activities. Crucially, the way water moves around in this part of the lake has helped to preserve such clues.\n\"It accumulates because there is a kind of gyre that keeps the sediment within the bay,\" he says, referring to Vidy Bay, on the northern shores of the lake. In a 2017 paper, he and colleagues describe the heavy metal pollution that became evident here in sediment layers dating to the 1930s. Among the specific examples he gives is a spike in mercury contamination during the 1970s.\n\"We know there was an accident in one of these industries,\" explains Loizeau. \"There was some spilling of mercury because there was a break in a tank and we really find this peak in the sediment.\" Plus, traces of elements such as barium in the cores could be linked to the rise of the automobile, adds Loizeau \u2013 because car brakes often contain barium.\nBesides metals, radioactive materials have also found applications in various industries. In Switzerland, for instance, radium was long used to make glow-in-the-dark details on watch faces. Remnants of radium from the watchmaking industry have turned up in landfill sites and buildings in the country.\nAnd scattered around the globe are pieces of evidence that reveal the grim legacy left by nuclear weapons during the 20th Century. Take the giant craters in the Nevada desert made by huge weapons tests, for example. But some contamination caused by nuclear detonations is much more subtle.\nIn 2019, researchers revealed that some of the grains of sand on beaches near the Japanese city of Hiroshima are in fact particles of debris created when the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city on 6 August 1945, towards the end of World War Two. \"The chemical composition of the melt debris provides clues to their origin, particularly with regard to city building materials,\" the authors wrote. In other words, the bomb turned buildings into dust, heat from the explosion reshaped that dust, and the blast ultimately spread this material across the nearby landscape \u2013 marking it forever.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nRemnants of nuclear explosions are not confined to the outdoors. They may be in your attic, too. Attic dust often lies undisturbed for decades \u2013 unlike urban soil, which is more likely to be disturbed \u2013 so traces of contaminants may remain.\nA study published in 2003 reports the results of a survey of 201 homes in the US state of New Jersey. Among the traces the researchers found there were lead concentrations that roughly correlated with the prevalence of lead in air pollution during the 20th Century. But they also found small amounts of Caesium-137, a radioactive isotope. This was more common the older the property was and could perhaps be explained, the researchers suggest, by the frequency of above ground nuclear weapons tests in the US \u2013 especially during the 1950s and 1960s.\nSiano and his colleagues are now looking further afield in their search for clues of human history embedded in nature. The team has collected more than 120 sediment cores from nine different countries around Europe, with the hope of finding further correlations between historical events and trace DNA or metal contamination left in those cores.\u00a0\n\"We can look for the impacts of the Vesuvius volcano [eruption] in Naples,\" says Siano, noting that the volcano last erupted in 1944. And here, as in other locations, the team may also detect signs of radioactive material ejected during the Chernobyl disaster \u2013 contamination from the accident having spread to over 40% of Europe.\u00a0\nAnd in yet more places, says Siano, evidence of everything from oil spills to the development of oyster farms may have been locked away in the sediment. \"We have all the material to answer these questions,\" he says.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that...

It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "article_text": "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the latest move in a row between the Trump administration and career US attorneys. \nSeven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case. \nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News on Friday that it was her understanding that the case against Adams would be \"dismissed today\". \nAdams was indicted last year on fraud and bribery charges. He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe request to drop the charges will require approval by a judge.\nEarlier in the week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove - Bondi's second-in-command - ordered the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office to end the case.\nBove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. \nThe motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case \"would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies\".\nBut several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.   \nSassoon resigned from her post on Thursday and was followed by six of her colleagues.\nShe said dropping the case would set a \"breathtaking and dangerous precedent\".\nThe latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for \"using prosecutorial power\" to influence elected officials.\n\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\nIn a letter accepting Sassoon's resignation, Bove said his office would be investigating the attorney, claiming she had \"lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice\". \nIn a statement, Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle defended the decision to dismiss the charges, saying it showed \"that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\".\nMr Mizelle said that prosecutors who refuse direct orders \"have no place\" in the department.\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. \nIn Sassoon's resignation letter, she also said  Adams' lawyers had met justice department officials and asked for a \"quid pro quo\", saying the New York City mayor could help enforce Trump's immigration policies if the case against him was dismissed.\nBut Adams denied that was the case. \n\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered - nor did anyone offer on my behalf - any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\nAdams, a Democrat, has accused investigators of pursuing a politically motivated case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\nThe New York mayor has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he won the White House. He flew to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida days before the Republican president took office. \nAfter a meeting with US border tsar Tom Homan on Thursday, Adams said he would agree to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to re-establish an office at the city's Rikers Island jail. \nTrump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the case against Adams. \nBut Bove's letter described his instructions to drop the case as \"direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\".\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.\nWhile she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was \"consulting with other leaders in government at this time\". \n\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious,\" she said. \"But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction.\"",

This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself.

In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

        "article_text": "A year into their relationship, Jess and Nate got engaged next to the sea. \"It was a golden, sandy beach \u2013 empty and secluded,\" says Jess, 26. \"It was just us two there, so it was really intimate.\"\nExcept that the couple were actually hundreds of miles apart \u2013 and they were role-playing their engagement in the video game World of Warcraft.\nNate, 27, was living just outside London \u2013 and Jess was in Wales. After meeting briefly at an esports event in Germany in March 2023, the pair developed a long-distance relationship, playing the game together \"from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to bed\", says Nate.\nThe couple still play the game daily, even though they've been living together in Manchester since March 2024. And they know other couples who have found their partners through video games: \"It's a different way of meeting someone,\" says Jess. \"You both have such a strong mutual love for something already, it's easier to fall in love.\"\nNate agrees. \"I was able to build a lot more of a connection with people I meet in gaming than I ever was able to in a dating app.\"\nNate and Jess are not alone. According to some experts, people of their generation are moving away from dating apps and finding love on platforms that were not specifically designed for romance.\nAnd hanging out somewhere online that's instead focused on a shared interest or hobby could allow people to find a partner in a lower-stakes, less pressurised setting than marketing themselves to a gallery of strangers. For some digital-native Gen Zs, it seems, simply doing the things they enjoy can be an alternative to the tyranny of the swipe.\nSince it first appeared with the launch of match.com 30 years ago, online dating has fundamentally altered our relationships. Around 10% of heterosexual people and 24% of LGBT people have met their long-term partner online, according to Pew Research Center.\nBut evidence suggests that young people are switching off dating apps, with the UK's top 10 seeing a fall of nearly 16%, according to a report published by Ofcom in November 2024. Tinder lost 594,000 users, while Hinge dropped by 131,000, Bumble by 368,000 and Grindr by 11,000, the report said (a Grindr spokesperson said they were \"not familiar with this study's source data\" and that their UK users \"continue to rise year over year\").\nAccording to a 2023 Axios study of US college students and other Gen Zers, 79% said they were forgoing regular dating app usage. And in its 2024 Online Nation report, Ofcom said: \"Some analysts speculate that for younger people, particularly Gen Z, the novelty of dating apps is wearing off.\" In a January 2024 letter to shareholders, Match Group Inc - which owns Tinder and Hinge - acknowledged younger people were seeking \"a lower pressure, more authentic way to find connections\".\n\"The idea of using a shared interest to meet someone isn't new, but it's been reinvented in this particular moment in time \u2013 it signals a desire of Gen Z,\" says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at Warwick University whose research focuses on the digital technologies of romance.\nAccording to Danait Tesfay, 26, a marketing assistant from London, younger people are looking for alternatives to dating apps, \"whether that be gaming or running clubs or extra-curricular clubs, where people are able to meet other like-minded people and eventually foster a romantic connection\".\nAt the same time that membership of some dating apps appears to be in decline, platforms based around common interests are attracting more users. For instance, the fitness app Strava now has 135m users \u2013 and its monthly active users grew by 20% last year, according to the company. Other so-called \"affinity-based\" sites have seen similar growth: Letterboxd, where film fans can share reviews, says its community grew by 50% last year.\nAnd just as in the pre-internet age, when couples might have met at a sports club or the cinema, now singletons are able to find each other in their online equivalents.\n\"People have always bonded over shared interests, but it's been given a digital spin with these online communities,\" says Luke Brunning, co-director of the Centre for Love, Sex, and Relationships (CLSR) at the University of Leeds.\n\"It's increasingly difficult to distinguish between behaviour that's on a dating app and dating behaviour on another platform.\"\nHobby apps are taking on some features of social media, too: in 2023, Strava introduced a messaging feature letting users chat directly. One twenty-something from London explains that her friends use it as a way to flirt with people they fancy, initially by liking a running route they've posted on the platform. Strava says its data shows that one in five of its active Gen Z members has been on a date with someone they met through fitness clubs.\n\"[Online] fitness communities are becoming big places to find partners,\" says Nichi Hodgson, the author of The Curious History of Dating. She says a friend of hers met his partner that way, and they're now living together.\nThe same appears to apply to Letterboxd, too. With users including Chappell Roan and Charli XCX, it's a popular platform for younger people - two-thirds of members in a survey of 5,000 were under 34.\nThe company says it's aware of several couples meeting through the app, including one who bonded over a shared love of David Fincher's opinion-dividing 2020 drama Mank. \"It could be that seeing other people's film tastes reveals an interesting aspect of themselves,\" says Letterboxd co-founder Matthew Buchanan.\nSo what might be driving this? While dating apps initially appeared to offer \"the illusion of choice\", and a transparent, efficient way to meet partners, the reality for many has often proven to be different. The Pew Research Center found that 46% of dating-app users said their experiences were overall very or somewhat negative.\nThe recent decline in user numbers might also be a response to the way some apps are structured \u2013 in particular, the swipe feature for selecting potential partners, launched by Tinder in 2013 and widely copied.\nIts creator, Jonathan Badeen, was partly inspired by studying the 1940s experiments of psychologist BF Skinner, who conditioned hungry pigeons to believe that food delivered randomly into a tray was prompted by their movements.\nEventually, the swipe mechanism faced a backlash. \"Ten years ago, people were enthusiastic and would talk quite openly about what apps they were on,\" says Ms Hodgson. \"Now the Tinder model is dead with many young people \u2013 they don't want to swipe any more.\"\nAccording to Mr Brunning, the gameifying interface of many dating apps is a turn-off. \"Intimacy is made simple for you, it's made fun in the short term, but the more you play, the more you feel kind of icky.\"\nThe pandemic may have had an impact, too, says Prof Brian Heaphy at the University of Manchester, who has studied dating-app use in and after the lockdowns: \"During Covid, dating apps themselves became more like social media \u2013 because people couldn't meet up, they were looking for different things.\"\nAlthough that didn't last after the pandemic, it \"gave people a sense that it could be different from just swiping and getting no responses \u2013 all the negatives of dating-app culture,\" says Prof Heaphy.\nAnd in that context, the fact that video games or online communities like Strava or Letterboxd aren't designed for dating can be appealing. By attracting users for a broader range of reasons, there's less pressure on each interaction.\n\"Those apps aren't offering a commercialised form of romance, so they can seem more authentic,\" says Prof Heaphy.\nIt's a type of connection free from the burden of expectation. A different couple who met on World of Warcraft \u2013 and go by the names Wochi and PurplePixel \u2013 weren't looking for love. \"I definitely didn't go into an online game trying to find a partner,\" says Wochi.\nBut although initially in opposing teams, or guilds, their characters started a conversation. \"We spent all night talking until the early hours of the morning, and by the end of the night, I'd actually left my guild and joined his guild,\" says PurplePixel. Within three years, Wochi had quit his job and moved to the UK from Italy to be with her.\nAccording to Ms Hodgson, \"While some dating apps can bring out the worst behaviours, these other online spaces can do the opposite, because people are sharing something they enjoy.\"\nBecause of these structural elements, she doesn't think the recent decline in numbers is temporary. \"It's going to keep happening until dating apps figure out how to put the human aspect back.\"\nThe dating apps aren't giving up without a fight, however. Hinge is still \"setting up a date every two seconds\", according to a spokesperson; Tinder says a relationship starts every three seconds on its platform and that almost 60% of its users are aged 18-30. In fact, the apps appear to be embracing the shift to shared-interest platforms, launching niche alternatives including ones based around fitness, veganism, dog-ownership or even facial hair.\nThey're also evolving to encourage different kinds of interaction. On Breeze, users who agree to be set up on a date aren't allowed to message each other before they meet; and Jigsaw hides people's faces, only removing pieces to reveal the full photo after a certain amount of interaction.\nIt means that it's premature to proclaim the death of the dating app, believes Prof Heaphy. \"There's now such a diversity of dating apps that the numbers for the biggest ones aren't the key indicator,\" he says. \"It might actually be a similar number to before, in terms of overall membership.\"\nAnd there's a downside to people going to more general-interest apps looking for love \u2013 people might not want to be hit on when they just want to talk about books. Dating apps, at least, are clear about what their purpose is.\nIn an increasingly online world, the solution to improving relationships might not simply be to go offline. Instead, apps that can offer an experience which more closely mirrors the best of IRL interactions, while tapping into the possibilities of digital ones, might also show a way forward.\nWith the imminent integration of AI into dating apps, we are \"right on the cusp of something new\", says Mr Brunning. \"It's interesting to see if we'll end up with specific apps just for dating, or will we end up with something a bit more fluid?\"\nHe points to platforms in China that are more multi-purpose. \"People use them for chat, for community, and conduct business on them \u2013 they can also be dating platforms, but they're often not exclusively for that.\"\nIn the meantime, the interactions possible in less mediated communities like World of Warcraft could offer more of a chance to connect than conversations initiated by a swipe.\nJess and Nate's in-game engagement on the beach might not have been real, but the couple are hoping to change that soon. \"It's a matter of when, really. There are a few things we need to tick off the checklist, and then she'll be getting her ring,\" says Nate. And there'll still be a gaming element.\n\"You can role-play getting married,\" says Jess. \"So it could be funny to get all our friends together at some point in the World of Warcraft cathedral, and we could have a marriage ceremony.\"\nAdditional reporting by Florence Freeman\nTop image credit: Getty\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

According to some experts, people of their generation are moving away from dating apps and finding love on platforms that were not specifically designed for romance.And hanging out somewhere online that's instead focused on a shared interest or hobby could allow people to find a partner in a lower-stakes, less pressurised setting than marketing themselves to a gallery of strangers. \"The pandemic may have had an impact, too, says Prof Brian Heaphy at the University of Manchester, who has studied dating-app use in and after the lockdowns: \"During Covid, dating apps themselves became more like social media \u2013 because people couldn't meet up, they were looking for different things. \"Although that didn't last after the pandemic, it \"gave people a sense that it could be different from just swiping and getting no responses \u2013 all the negatives of dating-app culture,\" says Prof Heaphy.And in that context, the fact that video games or online communities like Strava or Letterboxd aren't designed for dating can be appealing. Around 10% of heterosexual people and 24% of LGBT people have met their long-term partner online, according to Pew Research Center.But evidence suggests that young people are switching off dating apps, with the UK's top 10 seeing a fall of nearly 16%, according to a report published by Ofcom in November 2024.",

        "article_text": "A Russian drone has hit the protective shelter over Chernobyl's damaged nuclear reactor, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.\nThe overnight strike at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident caused a fire that has since been extinguished, he added.\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog (the IAEA) said radiation levels inside and outside Chernobyl were normal and stable - but later the plant's chief engineer, Oleksandr Titarchuk, said the possibility of radioactive substances leaking \"now exists\".\nRussia has denied any claims it attacked Chernobyl, stating its military does not strike Ukrainian nuclear infrastructure and \"any claims that this was the case do not correspond to reality\".\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors nuclear safety around the world, said fire safety personnel and vehicles responded within minutes to an overnight explosion. No casualties were reported, the agency added.\nThe agency remains on \"high alert\" after the incident, with its director general Rafael Grossi saying there is \"no room for complacency\". \nMr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\". \nA catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.\nWhile the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.\nThe radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.\nZelensky posted footage on X appearing to show damage to the giant shield, made of concrete and steel, which covers the remains of the reactor that lost its roof in the explosion.\n\"Another 15 metres [50ft] to the side and there would have been a radiation accident,\" Hryhoriy Ishchenko, chief of the agency that manages the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, told reporters, according to local media.\nSince 1990, Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, while he admits the strike was a \"horrendous attack on a very important structure\", he is \"not concerned\" about the radiation risk.\nProf Smith told the BBC a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" below the damaged outer shield covers radioactive particles and dust from the explosion. \nSimon Evans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was head of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, which oversaw the construction of the protective dome in the 2010s.\nHe described the apparent strike as \"an incredibly reckless attack on a vulnerable nuclear facility\". \nThe shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.\nThe strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.\nThere appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.\nMr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.\n\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.\nZelensky claimed the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"definitely not preparing for negotiations\", after US President Donald Trump said Putin had agreed to begin talks to end the war earlier this week.\nThe incident at Chernobyl comes after increased military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, the IAEA said. \nIn December, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching a drone attack on a convoy of vehicles transporting IAEA experts heading to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear station.\nThe agency last year urged restraint when an attack on Zaporizhzhia raised the risk of a \"major nuclear incident\". Russia and Ukraine traded blame over the attack in August.\n\"I'm more concerned about Zaporizhzhia than Chernobyl,\" Prof Smith said. \n\"The reactors [at Zaporizhzhia] are currently shut down but there is more live fuel there. Chernobyl is still very radioactive, but it's not in a 'hot state' because of its age.\"\nThe number of people who died in the Chernobyl disaster remains disputed. \nAccording to the official, internationally recognised death toll, just 31 people died as an immediate result of Chernobyl while the UN estimates that 50 deaths can be directly attributed to the disaster. \nIn 2005, it predicted a further 4,000 might eventually die as a result of the radiation exposure.",

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through. You wouldn't get that if you went through some of those [private] schools.\n\"But what do you favour, the character of the man or someone who can pass off both hands at 16? There is good out of both.\"\nIf English rugby is short of the former, it could start looking in less familiar settings.\n\"There are thousands out there like me,\" says Genge of the state system's untapped talent.\n\"But until we open our doors to all the kids and give them the absolutely necessary tools and resources, we are going to keep having this conversation.\"",

        "article_text": "Becoming Led Zeppelin is a new authorised documentary that tells the \"untold story\" of the band, who despite achieving global influence and legendary status, are difficult to define.\nRock's mightiest anthems, and the tales surrounding them, tend to be continually replayed \u2013 and sometimes, their power fades over time. Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer.

At one point he was 66,000th in the virtual ticket queue but vowed to stay to the bitter end.\n\"I got stuck on about 53,000 for ages,\" he said, \"then all of a sudden it went down to [just] 40-something and quicker from there.\n\"Eventually there was one person in font of me but by the time I got in, everything was sold out, even the super-expensive VIP-type tickets were gone.\n\"It wasn't meant to be this time.\" He went on to say he was \"gutted\".\nFan Emily Pywell, from London, said she was trying to get tickets for her and her boyfriend, Brandon Hall. \nThe pair had tickets to Osbourne's last solo tour No More Tours II, which was cancelled in 2023. \nShe said: \"It's just disappointing for the actual fans that want to (go), that have tried to see them for years, and have lucked out to touts and potentially not as big fans, people that are just going for the experience.\"\nThe 29-year-old said it would be her partner's \"last chance\" to see the singer. \nSpeaking about her ticket-buying experience, she added: \"We had a bigger number in the queue than we'd had during the pre-sales and the rest of the week, [we] only just really got through just now, like two hours after.\n\"It's who can refresh the fastest and click on it the fastest, it's not really a fair system on Ticketmaster.\"\nShe said on Tuesday, the seating map would not load - and when she contacted Ticketmaster on X, she was told to refresh the page only to be kicked to the back of the queue. \n\"Yesterday, I was clicking on seats that are available, but it wasn't selecting them, even though I was clicking on them, so I wasn't able to do it then.\n\"And then today, it's just doing the same, you're just trying to click on them, and it won't select them, or it'll come up saying someone else has already bought them.\"\nMs Pywell now faces a battle to get hotel bookings refunded, after sorting them in advance.\nTicketmaster has been contacted for a comment. \nOthers, though, had better luck. \nSimon Humphreys, from Stourbridge in Dudley, who has an Ozzy tattoo, managed to get two hospitality tickets for \u00a31,088. \nHe explained: \"I said to my missus, this is your birthday, Valentine's, Christmas all done this year - and she's not even into rock or metal.\"\nElsewhere, fans Lauren and James Ashton, from Curdworth in Warwickshire, have been feeling excited. \nThey managed to get tickets on Thursday during a pre-sale event, thereby avoiding Friday's queue, although Mr Ashton joined it for a time just to gauge demand.\n\"I couldn't believe it really,\" he said. \"We logged in and saw we were 77,000.

He went on to say he was \"gutted\".Fan Emily Pywell, from London, said she was trying to get tickets for her and her boyfriend, Brandon Hall.",
