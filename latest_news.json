        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.\nSynaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

        "summary": "And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".Julia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. \"WATCH: Synaesthesia: The phenomenal power of human perceptionIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.The researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".They then listened to a second set of words. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations.",

Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.\nSabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards. \nArriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.\nBetter still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set. \nA former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).\nHopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short n' Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.\nLiam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.\nGossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Zayn and Louis both on tour, that seems unlikely.\nAccording to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".\nQuoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.\n\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"\nIt's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.\n\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony. \n\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"\nHe's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.\nBut in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".\n\nWith 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT. International viewers can watch the show on the official Brits YouTube channel.\nBBC News will be live from the red carpet from 16:30GMT - with a live page providing coverage throughout the night. \nArtist of the year\nGroup of the year\nAlbum of the Year\nRead the full list of nominees here.\n",

        "article_text": "Aaron Wainwright has been part of Wales teams that have both won and lost 14 games in a row\nMen's Six Nations: Wales v Ireland\nVenue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 22 February Kick-off: 14:15 GMT\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC 5 Live; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on S4C.\nNo player has experienced the pain across Welsh rugby quite as much as  Aaron Wainwright.\nAnd that is not only because of the last of the 11 stitches in his lip and cheek the 27-year-old was having removed on Monday.\nThe Dragons number eight was part of the Wales team that topped the world rankings in 2019.\nBut he has won just two of his last 27 games for club and country, against Zebre and Newcastle Falcons who were, at the time, bottom of their respective leagues.\nSince Wales' last Test win - against Georgia at the 2023 World Cup - Wainwright has lost 25 of 30 games and seen both his regional and national head coaches depart.\nDai Flanagan left Rodney Parade in November before Warren Gatland - who gave Wainwright his 2018 Test debut in Argentina - walked away from Wales last week.\n\"It's hard to miss anything with rumours on social media but until Gats actually addressed the room, we didn't really have a clue,\" Wainwright recalled.\n\"He just told the boys he was going to be leaving and wished us all the best for the rest of the campaign. It was pretty sad.\"\nGatland left after a second spell in charge which brought just six victories in 26 Tests. \nDuring his first 12-year stint the New Zealander had won three Grand Slams, reached two World Cup semi-finals and took Wales briefly to the rop of the world rankings.\n\"Upon reflection, it's important to realise and appreciate what a massive and positive influence he was for Welsh rugby over the years,\" added Wainwright.\n\"I made my Test debut under him and most of my international career, so on a personal level it was quite sad that it had come to that. \n\"But once that meeting happened we had to park it. I suppose that's what we have to do now - just put that to bed and focus on Ireland this week.\"\nWales host New Zealand among four 2025 autumn Tests\nSmith eyes future Test role after Wales link\nWho could replace Gatland as next Wales head coach?\nWainwright is an expert at shrugging off disappointment.\nDuring this 14-Test losing run, he was still named Welsh player of the year, picked up his 50th cap and has remained fiercely loyal to Dragons by signing a new contract.\nAnd he has, of course, experienced the other side of the coin having been part of the 2019 Grand Slam and 2021 Six Nations title successes.\n\"There's no hiding from the fact this is a pretty low point,\" said the 27-year-old.\n\"There isn't a lot of positivity around at the moment. You can switch off to some stuff online but you can't get away from everything.\n\"After some of the things we have seen on social media or read in the press, it just makes you want to go out and prove them wrong. That's definitely a driver for me this weekend.\"\nWainwright still enjoys a report with Welsh rugby fans\nWales interim head coach Matt Sherratt wants his beleaguered squad to play with a smile on their face. \nThat may be easier said than done but Wainwright remains a player in love with the game, even with all its flaws in Wales across regional and Test level, and even when approached by fans in supermarkets.\n\"I always get a lot of fans coming up and asking about what is going on at the Dragons or Wales but I actually love those interactions because people are so passionate,\" he said.\n\"They want what's best for the national side or the Dragons and understand this is a low point, but they're are excited about the chance for us to get back to where we were.\n\"I highlight 2019 as my best year in a Welsh shirt when we won the Six Nations and then reached the World Cup semi-finals. We want to get back there.\"\nWainwright may find himself at the foot of the Six Nations and United Rugby Championship but his commitment is resolute. \nHis try against Italy was his fifth this season, already his best return in senior rugby after just 11 games, and offered a glimmer of hope in the Roman rain.\nIt also came just a week after the studs of Antoine Dupont left him with an awful facial injury in Paris.\nIreland are now lining up to put the boot into Wales next, but Wainwright has made a career of picking himself back up. Wales hope to do so as well.\n\"Matt has made a big point about changing the mindset and players enjoying being in the Wales set up,\" he said.\n\"A massive thing is about sticking together as a player group because we're the only ones that can change things over the next couple of weeks.\n\"It's a massive challenge against Ireland, one of the best teams in the world. They're incredibly detailed in whatever they do and all the little things that they can get away with.\n\"So we have to be right on our game and enjoying the challenge.

We want to get back there. \"I highlight 2019 as my best year in a Welsh shirt when we won the Six Nations and then reached the World Cup semi-finals.",

But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.\n\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.\nUnder UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.\nEach carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.\nThe CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.\nMeeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.\nThis will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.\nAs the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.\nOther emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously. \n\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.\n\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"\nEmissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.\nThe CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.\nIt says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.\nThe costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.\nThe CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.\n\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.\nThis should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper. \nIt advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.\nThese costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.\n\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.\n\"It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.\"\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. \nMs McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \n\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. \nThe impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.\nBut analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.\nChina has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.  \nTrump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him.\nHis sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways.\nA tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. \nIf you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week.\nOne of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. \nDuring what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nThe exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nIt escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be \"thankful\" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three.\" \nThe Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.\nIn a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" \n\"He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" Trump said.\nAhead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. \nZelensky had said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. \nNotably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nBut Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed.\nTrump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. \nA big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. \nOn the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for \"a significant reduction\" in their staff by 13 March.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week.\nTrump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter the meeting, Macron said Trump had \"good reason\" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. \nTrump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nPart way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nTrump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president.\nThe clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the \"riviera\" of the Middle East.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (\u00a3792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. \nOfficials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes.\nTrump unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (\u00a33.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\nThe president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to \"high-level people\".\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. \nIt includes $4.5 trillion (\u00a33.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile.\nHowever, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law.\nTrump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation.\n\"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\"\nThe Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported.",

The Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled.In a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said \"Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office.\" Trump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where \"tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". During what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".The exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs.Macron walks tightrope with Trump as he makes Europe's case on UkraineWatch: Macron interrupts Trump over Ukraine fundingReuters5.",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has spoken to US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after a meeting between the two leaders in Washington descended into a row about US support for Ukraine. \nZelensky was welcomed to the White House by Trump, but the cordial talks ended in a shouting match in front of the media in the Oval Office as Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart to be more thankful for US aid and accused him of \"gambling with World War Three\".\nA statement from No 10 on Friday night confirmed the prime minister had spoken with the US and Ukrainian presidents and that he retained \"unwavering support for Ukraine\".\nZelensky is due in the UK on Sunday as Sir Keir hosts a summit of European leaders to discuss an end to the war between Ukraine and Russia.\nA No 10 spokesperson said: \"The prime minister has tonight spoken to both President Trump and President Zelensky.\n\"He retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine.\n\"The prime minister looks forward to hosting international leaders on Sunday including President Zelensky.\"\nThe Oval Office spat prompted words of support for Zelensky from key European allies, including France and Germany.\nIn the heated clash at the White House, both Trump and Zelensky interrupted each other repeatedly during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal.\nUS Vice President JD Vance, sat alongside others in the room, was also involved.\nA press conference scheduled to take place later in the day was cancelled, and Zelensky was asked to leave the White House before the minerals agreement could be signed.\nIn a later interview with Fox News, Zelensky said the public spat \"was not good\" - but the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged.\nSir Keir had met with Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, and the pair agreed to begin work on a new US-UK trade deal.\nThe prime minister also came bearing a letter from King Charles III inviting Trump for a second state visit.\nThere had been speculation that Sir Keir had also gone into the meeting to seek a US Security \"backstop\" in a European peace plan for the war in Ukraine. However, the US president stopped short of confirming such a commitment.\nTrump had previously criticised Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron, whom he met on Monday, of having \"done nothing\" to seek an end to the war in Ukraine.\nReaction to Friday's meeting between Trump and Zelensky appeared to largely fall along partisan lines among US politicians, with Republicans praising Trump and Democrats criticising him.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk were among the European leaders who expressed solidarity with Zelensky.\nFriedrich Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, wrote that he stood with Ukraine \"in good and testing times\", adding: \"We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\"\nIn a statement, Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch said \"respectable diplomacy is essential for peace\", adding that a \"divided West only benefits Russia\".\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey suggested Trump and Vance were \"bullying the brave true patriot Zelensky into accepting a deal that effectively hands victory to Russia\".\nThe leader of the SNP at Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the offer to Mr Trump of a second state visit should be revoked.\nIn Ukraine, there was broad appreciation for Zelensky holding his ground over what many Ukrainians see as an existential war.\n\"Trump's administration was so arrogant,\" one man in Kyiv told the BBC. \"When you look at Zelensky's face, you understand that the discussion behind closed doors was not so polite.\"\nRussia, meanwhile, said Trump and Vance had acted with restraint.

Starmer speaks to Trump and Zelensky after White House row5 hours agoShareSaveJacqueline HowardBBC NewsShareSaveReutersPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has spoken to US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after a meeting between the two leaders in Washington descended into a row about US support for Ukraine. \"The Oval Office spat prompted words of support for Zelensky from key European allies, including France and Germany.Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and TrumpIn the heated clash at the White House, both Trump and Zelensky interrupted each other repeatedly during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal.US Vice President JD Vance, sat alongside others in the room, was also involved.A press conference scheduled to take place later in the day was cancelled, and Zelensky was asked to leave the White House before the minerals agreement could be signed.In a later interview with Fox News, Zelensky said the public spat \"was not good\" - but the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged.Sir Keir had met with Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, and the pair agreed to begin work on a new US-UK trade deal.The prime minister also came bearing a letter from King Charles III inviting Trump for a second state visit.There had been speculation that Sir Keir had also gone into the meeting to seek a US Security \"backstop\" in a European peace plan for the war in Ukraine. However, the US president stopped short of confirming such a commitment.Trump had previously criticised Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron, whom he met on Monday, of having \"done nothing\" to seek an end to the war in Ukraine.Reaction to Friday's meeting between Trump and Zelensky appeared to largely fall along partisan lines among US politicians, with Republicans praising Trump and Democrats criticising him.French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk were among the European leaders who expressed solidarity with Zelensky.Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, wrote that he stood with Ukraine \"in good and testing times\", adding: \"We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nButtler on 'right time for me' to leave England captaincy\nThe end came quicker than anyone expected.\nJust six months ago England coach Brendon McCullum backed Jos Buttler to the hilt despite questions over his captain's future.\nEven after defeat by Afghanistan, most thought the decision would be made after the flight home. Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket. Were England to find a way, their rebuild could gain a jump start.",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola suggested Manchester City have a \"1%\" chance of qualifying\nPep Guardiola strode into the Bernabeu Stadium's palatial surroundings knowing Manchester City must overturn the odds - and logic - in a special place that usually reserves its miracles for Real Madrid.\nHe has known every emotion in this legendary arena on a Champions League journey that has brought him here with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nAnd on Wednesday, Guardiola will once more appear alongside his friend and great adversary, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, beneath those towering stands knowing victory will rank among his finest achievements.\nGuardiola rates City's chances of overturning a 3-2 deficit from the first leg of this play-off to reach the last 16 as \"1%\".\nAnd, to gauge the opinions of locals in a city that has held more Champions League victory parades than any other, they feel Guardiola is erring on the side of optimism.\nGuardiola was in measured mood when he appeared in front of the media at the Bernabeu, an environment that represented enemy territory during his time as  player and coach with Barcelona - and his message was crystal clear.\n\"We have to make it almost the perfect game,\" he said. \"We have to attack. We have to score goals. This is the idea.\"\nGuardiola is determined City will not leave the Bernabeu wondering or with regrets, saying: \"We must play with courage. We must be ourselves. It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Cinematographer Lol Crawley has had a front row view of the evolution of the entertainment industry over a career spanning more than 25 years.\nFrom listening to Bob Dylan \"on a Welsh hillside\" and studying A-level photography, to shooting some of the most iconic landscapes in modern film.\nHis much-acclaimed latest film, The Brutalist, is about a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the US.\nAnd as he prepares to attend his first Oscars as a nominee, Crawley looks back on his \"formative\" years in Wales with fondness.\nHe was born in Shrewsbury and grew up Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain, Powys, and loved watching films with his father.\n\"I remember insisting he woke me up to watch An American Werewolf in London. I was probably a bit too young for it\u2026 but I really wanted to see a horror movie,\" he recalled.\nThe launch of Channel 4, and in particular, a series called Road Dreams about road trips across America, was also \"really influential\".\nLike many Welsh children, he was exposed to a lot of music and really connected with it.\n\"For me, there's a really big crossover between music and film. When I'm operating a handheld camera, there's a kind of rhythm and a partnership with the performer,\" he said.\nHe continued: \"There's a real beauty and a gentleness to the landscape [in Wales] and I'm drawn to landscapes.\"\nCrawley finished audio visual (AV) studies at college in Wrexham, followed by media production at university, before moving to Los Angeles in 2019. \nHis first film was The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, starring Hugh Grant and shot in Wales, a few miles from where he grew up.\nA cinematographer, also known as the director of photography, is in charge of the look of the film, Crawley explained.\nThey work closely with the director and across the grip department, the lighting department and the camera department.\n\"Each day, we'll have a certain number of scenes that we really have to make,\" he said.\nThe Brutalist - the story of a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the US, directed by Brady Corbet and starring Adrien Brody, Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce - was filmed in Budapest over 33 days on a budget of about $10m.\n\"[It] sounds like a lot, but considering how big the film is in scope, and how long it is, it's a fairly modest schedule and budget,\" he said. \nEach day, the actors would spend time with the director on set as Crawley sat quietly in the corner, working out how best to shoot scenes.\n\"It's about movement of the actors and the camera, what is the focal length, how many shots do we need to tell this part of the story, and how am I going to light it,\" he said. \nHe said the least amount of time he had spent shooting was 21 days on Vox Lux - a film with Natalie Portman set in New York.\n\"The longest was probably 80 days or something, Mandela in South Africa,\" he added.\n\"So it does vary, but 33 days for this movie was very ambitious.\"\nBut, he said, budget did not determine success, as The Brutalist had proven.\nCrawley himself has already been awarded a Silver Frog at Polish cinematography festival Camerimage, won an award at the British Society of Cinematographers, scooped the Robby M\u00fcller Award in Rotterdam, and picked up the BAFTA for best cinematography - not to mention the film's host of other recognitions.\n\"If it's a well-written story, well executed and if the performances are as fine as this, you can make a movie for a million dollars,\" he said.\nHe said audiences \"living in troubling times in America\" connect with the film's themes such as \"abuse of power, art versus commerce, antiquity versus modernity\".\n\"You look at the statue of liberty at the beginning of the movie and it's upended, it's untethered... the statue of liberty is supposed to represent the very best of what America can be in terms of providing a safe haven and a new life for people,\" he said. \n\"We're betraying that at the moment, in my opinion.\"\nHe added it was \"unapologetic event cinema\", at three-and-a-half hours long, and shot on film.\nHe said there was still \"a long way to go\", but he felt there had been big improvements on film sets.\n\"Thankfully there are far more female camera technicians and cinematographers working now than there were and attitudes on set have become a lot better, behaviour on set has become better,\" he said.\nHe said the story and the people were the biggest factors in picking a project, particularly when spending a minimum of three months away from his LA home, where he lives with his wife, film and TV producer Annie Marter.\nThough he regularly rubs shoulders with A-list talent, he is not immune to being star-struck.\n\"I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan and I have been since I was like 10 years old, growing up on this hillside in Wales listening to the albums my dad had. I've worked with him twice now and each time I'm in awe and just find myself staring at him,\" he said.\n\"And I went to the [Oscars] nominees dinner, and it's like 'hello Ralph Fiennes, hello Kate Blanchett' and this is pretty wild.\"\nOn his bucket list is a sci-fi or space film, \"as long as it's an exploration of the human mind at the same time\" and not \"spectacle cinema for the hell of it\".\nAs for returning to Wales, he has ventured over to show his wife where he grew up and reunite with friends, but would \"like to get back more, for sure\".\n\"It would be remarkable to come back and film something in Wales, and there's a thriving film industry as well now.  So who knows?\"\nFor now, he plans to \"embrace\" the \"rollercoaster\" of the Oscars.",

He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards that year.\nIn the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nHe is accused of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes by using firearms or threatening them with violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, multiple women have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour shortly afterwards, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, and has previously labelled them as \"sickening\" \u2013 suggesting they were \"made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement issued at the start of February - in response to a claim from a lawyer that he would face more than 10 more civil lawsuits - Diddy's own lawyer restated that his client was innocent. \nIn a statement to the BBC in response to the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said:  \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of \"transportation to engage in prostitution\". His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release in the run-up to the trial, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, and describe a culture of widespread violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the request for bail, arguing that Mr Combs was a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses ahead of the sex trafficking trial. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled his trial will begin on 5 May.\nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of Mr Combs' court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but not livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge. \nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of the sex trafficking charge.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass. \nWhen asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.\" \nHowever, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.\nIn public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops. \n\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.\nAccording to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.\nPresident Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests. \nHe suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?\nThe short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.\nBritain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending. \nBut Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.\nInstead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.  \nThat force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.\n\nBut these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".\nOfficials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nIt could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.\nWhile Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.\nEuropean nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics. \nNato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough. \nBut the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.\nEurope's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.\nFrance is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.\nSir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.  But as for Donald Trump's question - would  Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no. \n",

        "article_text": "With season three of The White Lotus drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand.\nAs season three of\u00a0The White Lotus prepares to thrust Thailand's islands into the global spotlight, drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be.\nHeading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads.\nI checked into the Makathanee Resort next to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea.\nAs I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand.\nPromoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) as the country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours \u00ad\u2013\u00a0party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south \u2013 Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earned international recognition for sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nWhile many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism.\n\"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor \u2013 those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\"\nIn 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers.\nWhen to visit Koh Mak\nKoh Mak's high season is between November and April. In the low season (May to October), the island is almost deserted although boats still make the journey. Some resorts close at this time but those that remain open offer cheaper rates.\n\"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\"\nThis ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like the Koh Mak Coral Conservation Group offer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated by Trash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022\u00a0 Here's where Asia's best female chef goes for pad Thai in Bangkok\n\u2022\u00a0 Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat\nI spent the next few days earnestly practising slow-life activities: reading in a hammock, snoozing in a deck chair, swimming and taking long walks along the beach looking for shells. Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes \u2013 plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga.\nHow to go green on Koh Mak\n\u2022\u00a0Rent a bicycle or golf cart to explore the island\n\u2022\u00a0Join the Trash Heroes on Saturday morning for their weekly cleanup\n\u2022\u00a0Eat local rather than imported food\n\u2022\u00a0Sign up for a long stay at the Koh Mak Campus\n\u2022\u00a0Join in any of the eco-friendly activities on offer\nI took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined a tie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort.\nOne day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of the Koh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\"\nKoh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub, Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me.\nYet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm \u2013 cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness \u2013 it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand.\nIt is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In the past month alone, shadowy portraits have been found hidden in longstanding masterpieces by Titian and Picasso. What can they and other such discoveries tell us?\nSomething's stirring. Every few weeks, it seems, brings news of a sensational discovery in the world of art \u2013 of paintings hidden under other paintings and vanished visages twitching beneath the varnish of masterpieces whose every square millimetre we thought we knew. This past month alone has brought to light the detection of mysterious figures trapped beneath the surface of works by Titian and Picasso. But what are we to make of this slowly swelling collection of secret stares \u2013 these absent presences that simultaneously delight and disturb?\nIn early February, it was revealed that researchers at the Andreas Pittas Art Characterization Laboratories at the Cyprus Institute, using advanced imaging and a new multi-modal scanner combining different techniques, had proved the existence of an upside-down portrait of a mustachioed man holding a quill beneath the Italian Renaissance master Titian's painting Ecce Homo, 1570-75. On its surface, Titian's canvas portrays a bedraggled Jesus, hands bound by ropes, standing shoulder to shoulder with a sumptuously dressed Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who will sentence him to death. What is this strange, erased, anachronistic scribe doing here and what is he trying to tell us?\nThe presence of the hidden portrait, who peers imperceptibly through the craquelure \u2013 those alluring cracks in old master paintings \u2013 was first described by the art historian Paul Joannides and its significance to the surface narrative is more than incidental. While the identity of the topsy-turvy figure has yet to be determined, it is clear he helped shape the wrenching composition under which he has been buried for the past 450 years. The analysis of the materiality of the painting's layers in Cyprus has shown that the contours of the hidden figure's face dictated the curve of ropes binding Jesus's hands \u2013 establishing notes of harmony between the successive and seemingly contrary compositions.\nThat sense of quiet collaboration between layers of paint \u2013 between what is there and what used to be there \u2013 is more striking still in the hidden countenance of a woman found by conservators at The Courtauld Institute of Art beneath a painting from Pablo Picasso's Blue Period \u2013 a portrait of the artist's friend and sculptor Mateu Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto. Also discovered with the use of infrared imaging technology, the portrait of the as-yet unidentified woman is rendered in an earlier, more impressionistic style, and appears, when brought to the surface, to be whispering into de Soto's ear, as if the past and present had merged into a single suspended moment.\nIn most instances, these buried portraits are merely the ghosts of rejected compositions that we were never intended to see \u2013 and could not have, were it not for the aid of advanced imaging tools that allow experts safely to peer beneath the paint without harming a work's surface. X-rays uncover hidden sketches, while infrared reflectography is capable of exposing subtle details masked by old varnish \u2013 details which, once glimpsed, are impossible to unknow. Once revealed, these portraits demand to be reckoned with. What follows is a short survey of some of the most intriguing and mysterious portraits \u2013 very often self-portraits \u2013 found wriggling restlessly beneath familiar masterpieces: unsettling presences that remain forever immeasurably close and worlds away.\nThink of Rembrandt and we tend to think first of that dim, imperishable realm in which his sitters sit outside of time \u2013 an eternal stage crafted from charcoal and sombrous umber. What we don't think of is giddy greens and garish vermilions igniting the space with vibrancy and verve. But that is exactly what researchers found staring back at them when they subjected the Dutch master's painting, An Old Man in Military Costume, to macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) imaging and infrared reflectography. Trapped beneath Rembrandt's meditation on mortality, a giddy ghost of jaunty youth clad in raffish reds and incorrigible verdigris intensifies the poignancy of his masterwork.\nWith some paintings, the more we see the less we know. Take Artemisia Gentileschi's portrait of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, 1619. X-ray analysis of the Italian Baroque artist's work undertaken in 2019 revealed that she began the work as a self-portrait \u2013 one that closely resembles an earlier, and similarly entitled, Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, begun around 1615. Disentangling the two works' faces is tricky but scholars now think that the final work \u2013 which swaps a turban for a crown and a piercing stare for a pious, heavenly gaze \u2013 blends elements of the artist's own likeness with those of Caterina de' Medici, daughter of the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici, who commissioned the work. The result is proof that while an artist may be able to let go of a painting, a painting can never completely let go of the artist.\u00a0\nCaravaggio only signed one painting during his lifetime and did so with ghoulish flair in a squiggle of blood at the bottom of the largest painting he ever made, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, 1608. But that is hardly the only time the Italian master inserted a semblance of himself into his paintings. In 2009, scholars using advanced reflectography penetrated the cracked surface of Caravaggio's depiction of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, to rehabilitate a tiny self-portrait that he had secreted in the reflection of the carafe (an almost subliminal detail that clumsy restoration efforts had obscured after the portrait-within-a-portrait was first discovered in 1922). This strange, distorted, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't selfie in the vessel of wine is key to the work's meaning, amplifying as it does themes of drunken illusion and elastic identity that are central to Caravaggio's painting.\nOn the surface, Young Woman Powdering Herself is a playful meditation on how subject and style overlap. Here, Georges Seurat employs his pioneering pointillist technique of countless tiny dots to depict his mistress, Madeleine Knobloch, as she scatters her own flurry of powdery specks across her face. The dabs of paint seem to swirl in the air, all but clogging it \u2013 metaphorically powdering, too, anyone who stops to stare. These deftly deployed dabs of paint reveal and erase in equal measure, as if conjuring a world only to blot it out again. That sense of brilliant obliteration is intensified with the discovery of a hidden self-portrait \u2013 Seurat's only known one \u2013 in the open window which he later concealed beneath another flurry of dots depicting a vase of flowers. How dotty is that?\nSome people refuse to be forgotten, no matter how hard you scrub them from your memory. Italian modernist Amedeo Modigliani's famous Portrait of a Girl, 1917, is a compelling case in point. Some scholars suspect that the full-length portrait of a woman, concealed beneath the visible image, may depict an ex-lover with whom Modigliani ended a relationship a year earlier. In 2021, two PhD candidates at the University of London used Artificial Intelligence to reconstruct this hidden portrait, which strikingly resembles Modigliani's former muse and mistress, Beatrice Hastings. While the identity of both women, surface and hidden, remains uncertain, the layering reinforces themes of concealment and masking in Modigliani's work.\nIn his painting La Cinqui\u00e8me Saison, 1943, Ren\u00e9 Magritte portrays in profile two nearly identical men in dark suits and bowler hats \u2013 props that often signal the presence of his alter-ego in the artist's work. Both men hold small, framed paintings under their arms as they walk towards each other. The trajectory of their strides suggests not so much an imminent collision as a near miss \u2013 an eclipse, as one figure and painting slips behind the other. It somehow seems fitting that this painting \u2013 this painting of shuffling paintings \u2013 has been found, with the use of infrared reflectography, to be hiding under its surface another painting altogether: a portrait of a mysterious woman, who at once bears a strong resemblance to the artist's wife, Georgette, and has features that are wholly distinct. The discovery of the hidden portrait merely amplifies themes of riddling duality in the work of an artist known for his treacherously teasing images.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In the Himalayas of Nepal, snow leopards often prey on livestock and face retaliation from humans. A group of Nepali women have developed a simple solution to help keep both livestock and the predators alive.\nIn the stillness of a winter's night, a snow leopard slunk into the livestock enclosure on Rinchen Lama's farm. This big cat was out hunting, high in the hills of Dolpa, a Himalayan district in western Nepal. Everyone who lives in Dolpa can tell you about snow leopards \u2013 they are powerful predators. Those farm animals didn't stand a chance.\nRinchen remembers the scene the following morning: \"There was wool everywhere, matted with blood. I lost 37 sheep and goats that night, almost my entire livelihood.\"\nAnd then, a few months later, another attack. A snow leopard killed Rinchen's horse. Such losses are not easy to forget. \"We've been told conserving snow leopards is important, but for communities like ours, they make life very difficult,\" he says.\u00a0\nSnow leopards (Panthera uncia) are elusive creatures that inhabit the mountain ranges of 12 Asian countries. They like the high life. The big cats are generally found at altitudes between 3,000 and 5,000 metres (9,843-16,404ft) above sea-level, where they are the apex predators in the habitats they prowl. But they are also rare and secretive, making estimating their population difficult. But the creatures are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\u00a0\nThe last assessment of global snow leopard numbers in 2016 estimated that species population numbered between 2,700 and 3,300, though some estimates range as high as 7,000, according to the IUCN. Recent studies have also suggested that their population density may be far lower than previously estimated.\u00a0\nSnow leopard numbers are thought to be declining partly as their wild prey \u2013 the goat-like blue sheep or bharal, ibex, pika and hares \u2013 have been replaced by livestock, which are then killed by the predators instead. Domestic horses in particular have become an important food source for snow leopards in some areas. But it has also come with consequences.\u00a0\nFarmers who lose livestock to snow leopards \u2013 and so face the loss of their livelihood \u2013 sometimes choose to kill these cats in an attempt to prevent further attacks. But a pioneering conservationist in Nepal is working to change attitudes. And she couldn't do it without the help of local women.\nDespite growing awareness around the importance of wildlife conservation, snow leopard killings by humans are considered a significant threat to these creatures. One recent report from Traffic, a non-governmental organisation that tracks global trade in wildlife and plants, estimated that each year between 221 and 450 are killed globally, and 55% of these in retaliation for predation of livestock.\nIt might seem shocking to some that an animal as vulnerable and majestic as the snow leopard could be the target of killings. But the people who live in those places most threatened by these big cats tend to be very poor, the soil on their farms is infertile, and nearby infrastructure is sparse.\nRinchen's farm, for example, is part of a tiny Himalayan hamlet, in a valley flanked by tall rocky cliffs. As in other communities in Nepal, the people here share their scarce pasturelands with many wild animals, including musk deer, Tibetan wolves and bharal.\u00a0\nThe snow leopards do not have as much wild prey to hunt as they once did, meaning they often attack domestic animals. Rinchen's story, of a snow leopard killing many sheep and goats in an enclosure overnight, is a catastrophe for a Himalayan herder. Incidents like this fuel the ongoing conflict between the leopards and locals. And such attacks are surprisingly common.\nOne study published in 2020 found that each household in the high-altitude, ethnically-Tibetan area of Dolpo or Upper Dolpo \u2013 itself an area within the district of Dolpa \u2013 lost, on average, four domestic animals to snow leopards in one year. The resulting financial loss, of around 120,000-140,000 Nepali rupees (\u00a3690-\u00a3870/$900-1,050), is roughly equivalent to the average person's annual income in western Nepal.\n\"I have travelled to every corner of Dolpo taking surveys with herders,\" says Nepali conservationist Tshiring Lhamu Lama. \"I have lots of records detailing mass killings of their livestock.\" But by giving local people a stake in the animals' conservation, Tshiring argues they will gradually come to understand the value of conservation. Indeed, studies suggest that support for the snow leopards is high among herders in other parts of Nepal and only a minority believe killing the animals is a solution.\nTshiring says the main way to reduce retaliatory killings of snow leopards is to minimise the mass night-time killings of livestock, which remains the greatest source of tension between locals and wild animals. To that end, supported by the Snow Leopard Conservancy, a non-profit, she has provided outdoor, battery-powered lights to around 100 farmers and hopes to distribute them to around 500 more.\nThese devices emit colourful lights at night, which deter snow leopards. They are portable, durable, charge up using solar energy, and at night are easily fixed on a pole near to traditional livestock enclosures, also known as corrals. However, the lights are only a short-term solution. After a few years of exposure to them, the snow leopards learn to ignore them.\nPlaying radios and burning dung have also proved effective for deterring snow leopards from farms at night, says Rinzin Phunjok Lama, a conservation biologist and founder of UKALI, an organisation that works in community-based biodiversity conservation in western Nepal.\nHowever, both Rinzin and Tshiring agree the best long-term strategy for reducing mass killings of livestock is to make livestock enclosures or corrals predator-proof. Corrals in Dolpa tend to be roofless structures with low walls, which keep the livestock herd together but do not keep snow leopards out. So, in early 2024, Tshiring, along with local herders from the remote village of Tilling, designed and built Dolpa's first leopard-proof corral.\n\"At first, I proposed a rammed-earth construction, as I saw that all the houses in Upper Dolpo are made of locally available clay and soil,\" she explains. However, the locals disagreed, telling her that increased rainfall, caused by climate change, sometimes erodes these rammed-earth foundations in their own houses. Tshiring decided to use a stone foundation instead. It also means there is no chance of the snow leopards tunnelling in.\u00a0\nWomen are able to transport the materials needed to build these hardened corrals. This is important because men are often absent, as they leave villages to trade, so women must take care of the livestock. \"Women are the main people who have to deal with the snow leopards \u2013 so they must be involved,\" stresses Tshiring.\u00a0\nIndividual pieces of metal required for the corrals were less than five feet (1.5m) in length and transported from Kathmandu to Upper Dolpo. There, local women herders weaved wire into sections of mesh fencing, and then fixed these structures to a metal frame. The construction, Tshiring hopes, will provide a model for other communities in the area.\nA similar approach in Hemis National Park in Ladakh, a Himalayan region in northern India home to around 500 snow leopards, proved highly successful in reducing mass killings of livestock.\u00a0\nSince 2001, led by Snow Leopard Conservancy India Trust India, a community-based conservation organisation, locals have constructed nearly 200 predator-proof corrals, first in Hemis and then in other areas. These designs used wire-mesh and wooden beams. It helped to cut the number of mass livestock killings from 5.5 to 0.5 per year.\u00a0\nAnd in the flat plains of the Southern Gobi desert in Mongolia, researchers erected a simple 2m (6.6ft) tall wire fence around an old stone corrals as part of a study, the results of which were published in 2020. These fences proved highly effective in terms of preventing night-time killings of livestock.\nAccording to Ghana Gurung, director of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Nepal, as long as livestock graze in the snow leopard's habitat, it will be impossible to stop all predation by these big cats. He suggests that herding practices be improved, but also adds that farmers must tolerate some smaller livestock losses. Domestic animals have always made up a significant proportion of snow leopards' diets, he says.\nResearch has also found both wild and domestic prey to be crucial to a snow leopard's diet, with the numbers of wild prey positively tied to the size of snow leopard populations. However, studies have failed to identify if the abundance of wild prey has any effect on levels of livestock predation by snow leopards, indicating it may not be as simple as increasing wild prey numbers to control levels of livestock depredation.\u00a0\n\"For us, snow leopards are deities who are protecting the ecosystem of the mountains. If you anger them, then they will kill more,\" Gurung explains. \"Losing one or two of your livestock is OK, it keeps the deity happy.\" There must, however, be an alternative source of income that compensates for continued losses, he says.\nTshiring hopes to source additional funds from snow leopard tourism, which supports conservation of both animal and human populations in this remote part of the world. In 2020, she spent three winter months in Dolpa, surveying snow leopards with camera traps, searching for scat and territorial marks left by the leopards, to ensure that it was possible to spot the cats reliably. Then, she established a local tour operator called Snow Leopard Journey. It brings small groups to Dolpa with 10-15% of the profits going back into snow leopard conservation projects in the area.\nTshiring explains she was inspired by a similar approach to snow leopard tourism in Ladakh, which was launched in 2002. The programme involved mapping trekking trails, helping locals to set up accommodation for tourists, and training people to become snow leopard guides and spotters. First piloted in Hemis National Park, the programme now boasts 218 families trained and willing to host visitors across the region.\n\"It took a lot of time for people in this region to understand the concept in the beginning. Most of them were against hosting strangers in their homes,\" says Tsewang Namgail, the director of the Snow Leopard Conservancy India Trust India. \"But when they saw it could be a good income generating opportunity then it took off from there. Today we are still taking the concept to more villages.\"\nIndeed, research suggests that becoming involved in the tourist trade has improved Hemis locals' attitudes towards wildlife, particularly snow leopards. On average, according to Namgail, families who host visiting tourists can earn between 65k and 103k Indian rupees ( $750-$1,190/\u00a3600-\u00a3950) during the annual four-month tourist season.\u00a0\n\"In places where snow leopards killed livestock on a day-to-day basis, the same areas have developed tourism, which is bringing in 10 times more than they had earned from rearing livestock,\" Namgail explains. Retaliatory killings of snow leopards have plummeted, he says.\nToday, Tshiring has trained 15 young people in her local community to work as snow leopard spotters. Half of them are women. \"It took time to convince them. They didn't see this as a viable job option,\" she says. But now the team is well-motivated. Plus, other locals now work as cooks, porters and hosts.\nDespite Tshiring's emphasis on including women in her projects, most conservation groups and committees in Nepal remain male-dominated. The participation of women is hampered by a female literacy rate in the areas Tshiring works, of around 37-40%, compared to a national average of 69% for Nepali women. According to Justine Shanti Alexander, country director of wildlife conservation organisation WCS Mongolia, women remain under-represented in many conservation projects across all countries with snow leopard habitats.\n\"Women in pastoral communities possess specialised knowledge and play critical roles in livestock management and natural resource use,\" Alexander says. \"Their insights into human-wildlife interactions, especially regarding livestock predation by snow leopards, are valuable for effective conservation strategies.\"\nAlexander emphasises that women should be empowered to take on leadership roles in conservation, and become involved in local projects set up by others.\u00a0\nOverall, she argues that the focus of snow leopard conservation should be on supporting the whole community to develop decision-making capacities and take ownership of projects. \"In my experience, this approach can lead to improved conservation outcomes for snow leopards, and increase their sustainability,\" Alexander says.\nPhunjok Lama agrees that such initiatives must be embedded in communities, where trust and an understanding in the process may develop gradually over time. A long-term presence is crucial, he maintains. \"If I have built trust with the community, and made them understand the value of conservation, they will have the ambition by themselves,\" he explains.\nBack in Dolpa, Tshiring has plans for 11 more predator-proof corrals in prime snow leopard areas. However, challenges remain. Transporting the necessary materials is expensive and accounts for most of the total cost of these interventions. Projects depend on the availability of international funding, and a lack of skilled human resources in the area means training also requires significant investment.\nTshiring says that introducing large-scale tourism is not her aim, as it risks disrupting the delicate habitat here. A relatively small number of visitors per year still has the potential to support both the snow leopards and the livelihoods of locals in Dolpa, without leading to degradation of the natural environment.\nBut for now, she can tell that local attitudes are changing. \"Before the local people were looking at me as if I was an enemy. They are the guardians of their livestock, and I am the guardian of the snow leopard. And there was no crossing point,\" she recalls.\u00a0\nNow, many local people have expressed an interest in receiving spotter training, receiving a leopard-deterring light, or building a predator-proof corral.\u00a0\n\"For me, I need to preserve both \u2013 snow leopards for the ecosystem, and livelihoods for the people,\" she says.\n* The travel for reporting this article was partly funded by the\u00a0Royal Geographic Society\u2019s Neville Shulman Award.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The ideal poo is a 'type 3' or 'type 4' \u2013 cracked or smooth sausage \u2013 delivered once per day.\nAre you a three-times a day kind of person, or is a trip to the lavatory a more rare and special occasion? And crucially, what does your poo frequency reveal about your health? Sit down, relax, and learn about the science of poop.\u00a0\nHow often we go for a number two can vary from person to person. Every time we eat, the large intestine contracts and pushes food along the digestive tract. This automatic \"gastro-colic reflex\" results in a the release of hormones that create the urge to poo, otherwise known as a \"call to stool\". Most of us have learnt to suppress this urge, however, meaning that once a day or less has become the new norm.\n\"We all tend to be too busy to poo,\" says Martin Veysey, a gastroenterologist and general medicine physician based at Canberra Hospital in Australia.\nConventionally, it has often been claimed that one poo a day is a sign of good gut health. But in the past it wasn't known what constitutes 'normal' when it comes to bowel movements. One study even implied that anything from one bowel action every few weeks or months to 24 poos a day could be regarded as normal.\nHowever, thanks to the pioneering work of scientists like Ken Heaton, a consultant physician at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the UK, we now known better. In the late 1980s, Keaton and colleagues surveyed residents of East Bristol, asking them the rather impertinent question \u2013 how often do you poo?\u00a0\nThe results revealed a huge variety in bowel movements. Although the most common bowel habit was one poo per day, only 40% of men and 33% of women adhered to this practice. Some defecated less than once a week, others three times a day. Overall, the study concluded that \"conventionally normal bowel function is enjoyed by less than half the population and that, in this aspect of human physiology, younger women are especially disadvantaged\".\nIncidentally this wasn't the only contribution Heaton made to the science of stools. He later helped devise The Bristol Stool Form Scale, which, with its accompanying illustrations, has become a widely used practical guide to help doctors diagnose digestive problems. The scale features handy descriptions of stools varying from \"separate hard lumps, like nuts\" to \"fluffy pieces with ragged edges\".\nThe NHS and other health bodies state that having a bowel movement between three times a day and three times a week is considered normal. But normal and healthy aren't necessarily the same thing. Scientists might have solved the mystery of how often we poo, but it does nothing to answer the question how often should we poo? Increasingly, researchers are finding that a person's bowel movements are a strong indicator of their health.\nFor example, a\u00a02023 study\u00a0examined the bowel habits of 14,573 adults in the United States. The most frequent bowel habit was seven times per week (50.7% of people), and the most common poo type was \"like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft\". Researchers then tracked the participants for over five years to see if there was any relationship between stool frequency and mortality. They found that people who pooed four soft stools a week were 1.78 times more likely to die within five years than those who pooed normal stools seven times a week. Infrequent defecators were also 2.42 and 2.27 more likely to die from cancer and cardiovascular disease, respectively.\u00a0\nHow much is a good amount to poop is also a question occupying Sean Gibbons, a microbiologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, the US. In 2024, Gibbons led a study which categorised 1,400 healthy adults into four groups based on their toilet habits; constipated (one-two bowel movements per week); low-normal (three-six bowel movements per week); high-normal (one-three bowel movements per day); and diarrhoea. They then looked to see if there was any association between poo frequency and a person's gut microbiome.\u00a0\nGibbons found that frequent pooers who squeezed out one to three stools a day had a higher proportion of 'good' bacteria residing in their guts than those who visited the lavatory less often. On the flip side of the coin, Gibbons found that people who pooed less than three times a week were more likely to have toxins in their blood that have previously been implicated in conditions such as chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's.\n\"In the Goldilocks zone of pooing [the high-normal category], we saw a rise in strictly anaerobic microbes that produce chemicals called short chain fatty acids,\" says Gibbons. One of these short chained fatty acids (SFAs), butyrate, is known to lower inflammation in the body. This is important, because chronic inflammation is now thought to be the driving factor behind conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even Alzheimer's.\n\"Having higher levels of butyrate also allows you to control glucose levels in your blood better, so you have better insulin sensitivity,\" says Gibbons. \"Butyrate will also bind to cells in the gut, stimulating them to produce hormones that make you feel full,\" he says.\nGibbons believes one reason people who were constipated had higher levels of harmful toxins in their blood stream is that when a person has infrequent bowel movements, poo sticks around in their gut for long periods. This causes bacteria in the gut to eat up all of the available fibre, converting it into health-promoting SFAs. The problem, however, is that once all the fibre is gone, the bacteria start fermenting proteins instead \u2013 which releases harmful toxins into the bloodstream. These toxins are known to cause damage to organs including the kidneys and heart. One, known as phenylacetylglutamine, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, for example.\u00a0\n\"If you have chronically high levels of this metabolite in your circulation, it can promote atherosclerosis, a kind of hardening of the arteries and damage to the cardiovascular system,\" says Gibbons.\nGibbons says that even though clinical guidance states that between three stools a day to three poos a week is healthy, his study showed that even in the low-normal stool group there was a rise in toxins in the bloodstream.\u00a0\n\"It's hard to say definitively, because we don't have causal data to know whether these people went on to get sick in the future, but it does seem to be the case that, based on what we were looking at, pooping every other day to a couple of times a day is probably a better window to be healthy,\" says Gibbons.\nHowever, as ever, correlation is not causation. It is possible that people who are already less healthy in other ways might have less frequent bowel movements, although Gibbon's study tried to control for this by only selecting adults who had no reported health concerns.\nOne measure of the health of your gut is the time it takes for food to travel through your digestive system \u2013 known as gut transit time. You can easily test this at home by eating brightly-coloured foods such as sweetcorn, and then timing how long it takes to come out the other end. Generally speaking, the longer a person's gut transit time, the less often they poo, and the more likely they are to suffer constipation.\nMore like this:\nIn 2020, researchers at King's College London gave blue muffins to 863 people to measure their gut transit time. This was part of the Predict1 study \u2013 a clinical research project focused on understanding how individual variations in genetics, gut microbiome, and other factors influence how different meals affect blood sugar and fat levels in the body.\u00a0\nThe study revealed that gut transit times varied widely from person to person, ranging from under 12 hours to many days. Remarkably, the microbes found in the guts of people with short transit times \u2013 who tended to defecate more often - differed remarkably from those with longer transit times, with a short transit time associated with a healthier gut microbiome.\n\"What we found was that people who had a longer transit time tended to have more 'bad' gut bacteria, so bacteria that have previously been linked to having worse heart health and metabolic health,\" says Emily Leeming, a microbiome scientist at King's College London.\nThis finding was most pronounced for people with a gut transit time of 58 hours or more, who tended to poo less than three times a week.\nLike Gibbons, Leeming suspects that in those whose poo spends longer in the gut, microbes aren't getting a fresh meal \u2013 so they end up switching from eating fibre and carbohydrates to proteins. This then produces byproducts which are bad for your health.\nAs well as a healthier gut microbiome, Leeming's study revealed that those with shorter gut transit times benefited from having less\u00a0visceral fat \u2013 a type of fat that lies deep within the belly and surrounds abdominal organs. Visceral fat is dangerous because\u00a0it can increase your risk of many health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Finally, people with short gut transit times also displayed healthier responses to food, known as a 'postprandial response'. This means they had lower levels of sugar and lipids in their blood following a meal, lowering their risk of cardiovascular disease.\nThe finding fits with what scientists know about constipation, and its links to chronic disease. If someone is chronically constipated, then they may be at higher risk of things like bowel cancer. However, the evidence to support this is mixed \u2013 one meta-analysis, a type of study which combines the results from several others which answer the same question, found that bowel cancer was not more prevalent in constipated individuals.\n\"But we also seeing links with other parts of the body. For example, people with Parkinson's Disease can have constipation up to 20 years before they show any motor symptoms,\" says Leeming.\nVeysey, meanwhile, points to the known link between slow bowel transit and gallstones \u2013 hard deposits of bile that form in the gallbladder. \"It also raises the risk of developing polyps, pre-cancerous lesions in the bowel, which then can become cancers,\" he says.\nRather than the number of bowel movements a week \u2013 which can vary from person to person, Leeming says that the key thing to look out for is any unexplained changes in bowel habits. She also advises that it's a good idea to keep track of your regular pooping habits to get to know what's normal for you.\u00a0\n\"We should all be looking at our poo, because it's basically like a free gut health test,\" says Leeming. \"It's not just how often you go, it's also colour and the shape of your poo as well. What you're really looking for is type 3 to type 4 [on the Bristol Stool Form Scale], which is basically a sausage with cracks in it, or a smooth sausage.\"\nAs regards colour, if you see any black or red in your stools, that indicates the presence of blood. Although there could be a harmless explanation for this, it could be a sign of colorectal cancer and so it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. You should also talk to your doctor if you regularly have diarrhoea or need to go very suddenly, or if you experience a lot of cramps, bloating, and gas after eating.\nFinally, if you'd like to become more \"regular\", there's three simple things you can do. \"In our study, the people in the Goldilocks zone ate more fruits and vegetables, were more hydrated, and were more physically active,\" says Gibbons.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Plymouth have already shocked Brentford and Liverpool in the FA Cup this season, but can they upset another Premier League team, Manchester City, in round five?\n\"Argyle have gone really direct under new manager Miron Muslic,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"It's a great clash of styles with the possession football that Pep Guardiola plays, but the problem if you keep going long against City is that you keep giving them the ball back.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all eight fifth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against comedian and Plymouth fan Josh Widdicombe.\nWiddicombe is touring the UK with his 'Not My Cup Of Tea' stand-up show in 2025 and 2026, which culminates with two nights at the Hackney Empire in London.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nWiddicombe co-hosts the Parenting Hell podcast with Rob Beckett and recently triumphed on BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special\nJosh missed Plymouth's famous win over Liverpool in round four because he was at a Strictly Come Dancing Live Show with his daughter, so will he be at Etihad Stadium this weekend?\n\"No, I will be in Chipping Norton, doing a preview show for my tour,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"My on-stage time will be 7.30pm which would be when injury time starts. That's life!\n\"I was actually disappointed we got City because when you get into the fifth round of the FA Cup, you start thinking that, if we get an easy draw, we are in the quarter-finals. \n\"So, City were the worst possible draw, really. The fact the FA Cup is the only thing they can win doesn't help much either. If they were playing in the Champions League next week we would be in a slightly better position.\n\"Still, the longer we go without conceding, the more I will dare to dream. I would obviously take penalties now, in a heartbeat, even though I would be on stage.\n\"Although, by the time penalties happen, after all the injury time and extra time, it might be around 8.15pm, which is when my break usually is.\n\"That's what I am going to be wishing for, because I might just get to see a shootout - but honestly let's just hope the tie is still up for grabs when I go on stage.\"\nWiddicombe (right) poses with famous Bolton fan Vernon Kay before the 2023 Papa Johns Trophy final - the last time Plymouth reached Wembley. Sadly for Josh, the Pilgrims lost 4-0\nJosh co-hosted the cult podcast about 1990s football 'Quickly Kevin, Will He Score?' between 2017 and 2024 and feels that decade was full of classic FA Cup moments.\n\"There were lots of iconic finals in the 1990s,\" he added. \"I can instantly tell you the result and every goalscorer of every one, while I am struggling to tell you who won it last year.\n\"That's because of a combination of two things - firstly, in the same way you remember what was Christmas number one when you were a kid, everything is more vivid the first time around - it is more exciting and seems to matter more.\n\"Also, sadly, the FA Cup is not nearly as important as it was. You've even got some Plymouth fans saying they would rather stay up than win it this season - my response to that is 'are you clinically insane? Who cares if we stay up!'.\n\"In a few years you are not going to say 'oh thank God we are in the Championship. You are going to go 'can you remember when we won the FA Cup!?!' That's what you dream about.\n\"Those one-off events are the things you cling on to, and in a strange way I am glad that because I wasn't able to go to our win over Liverpool, I was at Strictly Live with my daughter instead.\n\"That makes it more of a memory for me. I will always remember where I was when it happened, and it wasn't just the case where I was at home watching on TV and then I had to go to the park.\"\nChris Sutton and Josh Widdicombe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nVilla Park, 20:00 GMT\n10th in Premier League v 19th in Championship\nGap = 29\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe rest of the season is going to be a bit of a juggling act for Aston Villa.\nThey are still in the Champions League and also trying to finish high enough in the Premier League to qualify for it again next season.\nSo, it will be interesting to see if they target the FA Cup too. I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.\nStill, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.\nLet's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.\nCardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.\nThey may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nJosh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. \nSo, there is quite a lot in this for them while, in contrast, if any of the Championship teams are going to be focused on the league it is Cardiff. 3-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup moment: It would probably be Wrexham beating Arsenal in 1992 with Mickey Thomas's free-kick for their equaliser. I don't like Wrexham now because they are the big dogs of the lower leagues but that was the iconic upset of my childhood.\nIt was probably the first big one that I saw for myself. When I was a kid, all the same FA Cup upsets used to get talked about all the time - like Hereford against Newcastle - but this was the first proper one I remember, after Arsenal had won the league and Wrexham had finished bottom.\nThis video can not be played\nFA Cup Archive: Wrexham upset Arsenal in 1992\nSelhurst Park, 12:15 GMT\n12th in Premier League v 12th in Championship\nGap = 8\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWill in-form Crystal Palace go for it in the FA Cup? I really hope so.\nOliver Glasner's side have improved as the season has gone on and they are comfortably in mid-table of the Premier League without any danger of going down. A cup run would really cap this as a successful campaign for him.\nIt would have an even bigger impact for Palace's fans. I still remember Ian Wright's goals in the 1990 final where they lost to Manchester United in a replay. They lost to United in the 2016 final too, and it would be great to give them a new memory.\nThis won't be easy, because former Norwich boss Alex Neil took charge of Millwall at the end of last year and is doing a good job.\nThey have been quite stubborn in recent weeks and I'm expecting more of the same here, but the Eagles should edge it in normal time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: We beat Millwall 5-1 off the back of of our win over Liverpool, which was a bit of a freak result. Normally you'd lose straight after that kind of game. \nLike Villa, Palace are another team who should be going for the FA Cup but Millwall have reached the final in my lifetime, even if it was fully 21 years ago. \nI'd gone for a replay at first, before I remembered there aren't any - the death of FA Cup replays is very sad, isn't it? 1-1 after extra time, then Millwall to win on penalties\nDeepdale, 12:15 GMT\n15th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\nGap = 12\nWatch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nThis will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.\nIt ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.\nMaybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?\nBurnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.\nPreston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.\nLet's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penalties\nJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support. \nBurnley in contrast are one of the six teams that are forever going to switch between the Premier League and the Championship. They are trying to win promotion this time by not conceding any goals whatsoever, which is different, but still not very exciting for their fans. \nThis is a local derby, but it is such a dry game. I'll go 1-0 to Burnley - no, 1-0 to Preston. 1-0\nVitality Stadium, 15:00 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 17th in Premier League\nGap = 10\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWolves won here in the Premier League on Saturday but only after Bournemouth had Illia Zabarnyi sent off in the first half. That completely skewed that result so I am not using it as a form guide for this tie.\nWhat will be more relevant is how many changes both teams make for this game. \nI was at Wolves' win over Blackburn in round four and their manager Vitor Pereira went kind of half-strong there. I can guarantee you he will be prioritising Premier League survival ahead of FA Cup progress, so we will probably see another mix-and-match selection from him here too.\nAs for Bournemouth, well I have already talked about why Crystal Palace should be trying to win the FA Cup this season, and the same definitely applies to Andoni Iraola's side.\nThe Cherries have only reached the quarter-finals twice before, losing at that stage in 1957 and 2021, and their best moments in the competition are probably as a lower-league giantkiller, such as when they beat Manchester United as a third-tier team in 1984.\nThis year they are genuine contenders to win it and lift the club's first major trophy, and they have already shown they can beat anyone, especially at home. \nThey are still seventh in the Premier League despite losing their past two matches, and I would be really disappointed - no, actually I'd be angry - if Iraola picks a weakened team in the situation they are in.\nHe has got a responsibility to the fans to try to reach the semi-finals for the first time. Yes they have got a chance of making the Champions League, which would be incredible, but they are only two wins away from their biggest day out ever at Wembley. Why not go for it?\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: Usually, the result never recurs when teams play each other twice in a short space of time, so I am backing Bournemouth. 2-0\nEtihad Stadium, 17:45 GMT\n4th in Premier League v 22nd in Championship\nGap = 38\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe FA Cup is Manchester City's only realistic chance of a trophy this season, so there is no chance they will lack focus here.\nCity come into this tie off the back of a good win at Tottenham on Wednesday, which I predicted. The readers went for a Spurs victory, which was just ridiculous - what on earth were you thinking?\nI am going for Pep Guardiola's side to win this comfortably, but fair play to Plymouth for getting this far.\nThey have knocked out Liverpool and won at Brentford but it is going to be third time unlucky for them against Premier League teams.\nWith what is at stake for them, City cannot let this one slip - and they won't.\nSutton's prediction: 5-0\nJosh's prediction: I think it is absurd when fans predict victories for their own team. They do it all the time, while I just go into every game thinking we are going to lose - that is my attitude to life, that surely this is going to go wrong.\nSo, I think we are going to lose every game 4-0, which actually feels like a worthwhile prediction here. Then you are always pleasantly surprised - well, maybe not always, but most of the time - when you don't. \nWe have played very, kind of, pretty football for the past five years but under our new manager, our playing style is, shall we say, a little more industrial these days.\nIt's much worse when you are at home trying to break down a team in the Championship but it is perfect for this scenario, away at Manchester City. We are practising the right type of football to cause an FA Cup upset but the truth of it is that we are not going to win, so who cares!? 4-0\nJosh on who will win the FA Cup? I obviously want Plymouth to win it but I think City will do it. So, in a way, this is one of those games where people say 'this is the real final'. Whoever wins out of Plymouth and City will go on and win the FA Cup.\nSt James' Park, 13:45 GMT\n6th in Premier League v 8th in Premier League\nGap = 2\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nAlexander Isak missed Newcastle's defeat at Anfield with a groin injury so he has to be a doubt for this tie too, and his absence is a massive blow for Eddie Howe's side.\nBrighton have hit a bit of form since losing 7-0 to Nottingham Forest at the start of February, and have won four in a row in the Premier League and FA Cup.\nThe Seagulls also won at St James' Park earlier in the season, when Danny Welbeck got the winner. I remember that one because I got that prediction wrong.\nPeople are talking about Newcastle being distracted by their upcoming Carabao Cup final against Liverpool [on 16 March] but could they actually be in line for a domestic cup double this season?\nI am banking on them keeping that possibility alive here. They obviously could really do with having Isak back but, even if he is not fit, then surely Brighton can't win there twice this season... can they?\nSutton's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Newcastle are never going to win the FA Cup - they are always constantly about to win the FA Cup, and about to win their first trophy. I mean obviously they have got the Carabao Cup final coming up but, no, Newcastle will never win the FA Cup. Brighton are quite a 1980s team, aren't they, because of when they reached the Cup final in 1983? Let's see that again. 1-2\nOld Trafford, 16:30 GMT\n14th in Premier League v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nI am sick of backing Manchester United. Even though they beat Ipswich on Wednesday, they did not half make hard work of it and the Tractor Boys ran them close at Old Trafford.\nAlejandro Garnacho appeared to have a bit of a hissy fit after being hooked before half-time, so it will be interesting to see how Ruben Amorim deals with that. He won't have any players left at this rate if he decides to leave Garnacho out.\nUnited are the FA Cup holders and they have beaten Fulham home and away already this season but on both occasions it was far from convincing, and I don't really care about that anyway.\nAmorim is a likeable guy, and I've got sympathy for him about the size of his task at Old Trafford but, from watching United, I cannot think of any reason to back them to win this. \nI am usually wrong about Fulham, but they are going to take this one - 100%.\nSutton's prediction: 0-3\nJosh's prediction: I can see United getting to the cup final this year. They were quite jammy on their way to winning it last year - against Coventry in the semi-final for example - but were they actually jammy? It meant they kept Erik ten Hag for another six months which is probably the worst thing which could have happened to them. I don't know if that FA Cup win has made this season much worse. 2-0\nCity Ground, 19:30 GMT\n3rd in Premier League v 18th in Premier League\nGap = 15\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna made 11 changes when his side beat Coventry in round four and I suspect he will do something similar here.\nYou might have heard about 'Sutton's Super Computer', which were the calculations I did for the Monday Night Club this week, where I worked out the results of all the remaining Premier League fixtures.\nAccording to my secret formula, which is obviously extremely scientific, the Tractor Boys only have an outside chance of staying up. Along with Leicester they were in my 'no-hopers' category.\nMaybe Ipswich can surprise me and go on an FA Cup run, but you have to fancy Nottingham Forest here.\nDefeat would just leave a grim fight against relegation for McKenna's side, so I feel for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who regular readers will know follows the Tractor Boys, but not so much for my 5 Live colleague Ali Bruce-Ball who is a phony Ipswich supporter - when I asked him, he could not remember the last time he went to watch them as a fan.\nOne thing I really can't stand are people like Bruce who attach themselves to a club which has a bit of success, claiming some tenuous link from the past.\nMy boyhood team Forest may make changes too because they are still in a good position for a Champions League spot, but I am backing Chris Wood to come off the bench and get us a winner.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Forest are another throwback team who do not seem to have had a decent Cup run for a long time. 2-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup final of the 1990s: Spurs versus Forest in 1991 was a really important and seismic one, because of Gazza [Paul Gascoigne] and what it did to his career. \nThere were some other great ones too, though, like 1997 when Middlesbrough lost to Chelsea. That was quite fun because of Roberto di Matteo's goal after 47 seconds. \nThen there was 1995 when Manchester United lost to Everton after they had been going for the Double and lost everything, and even 1993 was interesting because Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday met in both domestic cup finals. I'm not going to, but you could write a book about the history of 90s football based around those finals, because they mattered so much then.\nChris has six correct results from the nine midweek Premier League games played so far in week 27, with one exact score, giving him 90 points.\nWith one game still to be played, he is level with his guest, singer Paige Cavell, who also has six correct results with one exact score.\nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, the BBC readers got three correct results with no exact scores, giving them 30 points.\nThey can no longer win this week, but the outcome of Thursday's game between West Ham and Leicester will decide whether Chris or Paige takes the victory.\nChris has gone for a 2-0 Hammers success while Paige has picked a 1-1 draw.",

I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.Still, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.Let's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.Cardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.They may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Josh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. This will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.It ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.Maybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?Burnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.Preston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.Let's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.Sutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penaltiesJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support.",

        "article_text": "The Jane Austen-hits-LA comedy changed fashion, language and cinema. As it turns 30 and a new stage musical version opens, its writer and director discusses why it's so personal to her.\nBack in 1995, Clueless offered a cheeky update of Jane Austen's Emma in a Los Angeles high school and, without even seeming to try, revolutionised how we dress and talk. Tartan and preppy chic are still huge (note the blazer and mini-skirt wore by Taylor Swift in London last August, or the pop star's yellow-and-black combo at an MTV awards do in September). Meanwhile, \"As if!\", the catchphrase of its heroine Cher, which originated as a piece of Californian slang, has become ubiquitous. Will you be spared the phrase in this article? As if!\nBecause the film is brightly coloured and revolves around teenage girls, some critics at the time undersold the sharpness of its satire, which targets (among other things) white, west coast privilege, the plastic surgery industry, celebrity do-gooding, taboos surrounding menstruation, the cruelly low wages of teachers, and the kind of Nietzsche-reading liberal male who feels compelled to grow a goatee.\u00a0\nThe popularity of Clueless triggered a rash of insouciantly smart high-school-meets-classic literature movies (including 10 Things I Hate About You, Cruel Intentions, and Easy A, to name but a few). Just as importantly, it started a trend for films and TV shows that focussed on friendships between teenage girls. Thanks not only to the script but also a flawless cast and tip-top soundtrack (so\u00a0much Radiohead), audiences of all ages found themselves rooting for salty protagonists, Cher, Dionne and Tai, who dominate the proceedings in a way that hadn't been seen before in a mainstream US film. Yes, there's a rom-com element to the plot, but it's the tensions between the girls that generate the most heat. Cher's complex interactions with Dionne and Tai paved the way for Buffy and Willow's textured relationship in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Also, not to be bitchy, but without Clueless there'd be no Mean Girls. And Olivia Wilde cited it as an inspiration for her riotous directing debut, Booksmart, itself a modern teen movie classic.\u00a0\nYet 70 year-old\u00a0Amy Heckerling, the film's writer-director, claims she had no idea Clueless would be a hit. \"Nobody is ever sure of that,\" she tells the BBC. \"Well, maybe some people are sure of it. Not me.\" Nor does she know if a new West End musical based on the film, for which she wrote the book, will click with audiences; it is currently running in previews ahead of an opening night in March. What matters, she says, is that she enjoyed working on both projects. She says of the musical, \"It will either work or it won't, but I'm loving doing it.\" As for the film, \"I have to admit, on that shoot I was happier than I've ever been. There were no big prima donnas. It was the closest I've ever come to imagining a movie in my brain and seeing it unfold\u00a0exactly\u00a0how I imagined.\"\nIn the last three decades there's also been a three-season Clueless TV show, a book series, and another go at a stage musical, which premiered on Broadway in 2018. Still, it's the original film we keep coming back to and that Heckerling, Zooming from her home in New York, wants to discuss.\u00a0\nAs in Austen's 1815 novel, the plot revolves around a self-absorbed daddy's girl. Cher (Alicia Silverstone; putty-soft and irresistible) bombs around Beverly Hills with best-friend Dionne (Stacey Dash; poised), obsessed with matchmaking and make-overs. Cher is determined to \"help\" a new girl at school \u2013 dishevelled New Yorker Tai (Brittany Murphy; volcanically beguiling) \u2013 and proceeds to treat Tai like a toy. That is, until Tai fights back and Cher, her mind blown, realises that Tai is her equal. Which is where Heckerling veers off from Austen (whose heroine is ultimately horrified by her protege's \"notions of self-consequence\"). Here's the truth about Clueless. It's not as good as Emma. It's way better.\u00a0\nHeckerling suspects that the film has such a loyal following (and keeps picking up new acolytes) because its \"two princesses\", Cher and Dionne, are so human: \"They rag on each other like real friends do.\" She thinks it's stayed relevant because space is given to characters who \"care about the environment\", including Cher's ex-step-brother, Josh, (played by sexy goofball Paul Rudd) and Cher's Greenpeace-supporting teacher, Miss Geist (a delightfully frazzled but unbowed Twink Caplan). Heckerling says, \"Having those people worry about stuff like that makes the audience relate to them. Well, that's what I've always assumed. I'm not a major activist, but I care about a lot of things.\" Heckerling is also proud of the film's many \"wonderful\" teens, some of them gay \u2013 like the closeted, blazingly charismatic Christian (Justin Walker) \u2013 others broke and scruffy, like lollygagging stoner Travis (Breckin Meyer).\u00a0\nBorn in the Bronx, to an often cash-strapped family, the pale and petite Heckerling has never felt like a top dog and happily acknowledges that her status as an outsider bled into Clueless's sly take on class conflict. She says that when she first went to California, to attend the American Film Institute, people made fun of how she talked. \"They'd go, 'Amy, you want some [she adopts a cartoonish New York accent] quawfee?' Their attitude was like, 'You're talking some old-fashioned, lower-class, New York language. What planet are you from?'\" On the one hand, it was wounding. On the other hand, she wanted to find a way to fight back: \"I didn't feel like I wanted to change how I spoke or who I was.\"\nAmy Heckerling's Five Culture Shifters\nFranz Kafka\n\nFranz Kafka changed modern literature\u2026 OK, maybe Joyce did that, too, but wouldn't you rather read Kafka? It's not even like reading, it's like entering a nightmare with a sense of humour. And I think most adolescents can relate to waking up from troubling dreams to find they've turned into horrible vermin.\nThe Twilight Zone\nWhen I was a teenager, everyone smoked pot daily, except me. I was addicted to The Twilight Zone, and pot made me worry the stories could come true. And some have. In Midnight Sun, it's always 120 degrees (49 Celsius) and the oceans dried up. How brilliant was Rod Serling?\nJames Cagney\n\nI first fell in love with Cagney when I was a toddler. He was a ball of energy, like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck. When I was a teenager and interested in boys, he was my main crush. In film school, I appreciated his acting and I admire how he led his life.\u00a0\nA Clockwork Orange and 1984 (the books and films)\n\nI'm combining these because what I love is the language. I don't go a day without saying \"Free me glassies\". The future teen slang in A Clockwork Orange (Anthony Burgess) was stylish and thrilling. George Orwell's creation of \"Newspeak\" was genius. The language of 1984 was deliberately getting smaller because without words, there's no thinking, and therefore, no intelligent resistance.\nThat's when she started keeping a notebook of all the new words used by her fellow students and, in the years that followed, any socio-economic tribes she encountered. She says she was especially interested in the \"very\" words \u2013 technically known as adverbs of degree, such as 'totally', 'majorly' and 'way' \u2013 \"because those 'very' words really define who you are, where you live and what year it is\". Which, of course, came in super handy for Clueless. Via the film, Heckerling demonstrates her complete mastery of LA lingo. At the same time, she finds a way to do justice to her own clique, aka earthy New Yorkers.\nClueless immortalises a whole bunch of characters who use Big Apple vocabulary and/or talk with unapologetically broad New York accents; there's Tai, but also Christian, Cher's dad Mel (Dan Hedaya), and a driving examiner (Ron Orbach). Nor is it a coincidence that we're shown a hilarious clip of a \"Bronx-y\" Tony Curtis, looking most uncomfortable in Spartacus (or, in Cher-speak, \"Sporadicus\"). According to Heckerling, Curtis delivers his lines in the way he does (ie at a snail's pace) because he's trying to appear more \"classy\". It's a tactic she's tried herself. \"When you feel kind of insecure about your accent, you try to talk\u00a0more slowly, as though that will get the Bronx out of it.\" The subliminal message sent by Clueless: Don't try to hide who you are. Own it.\u00a0\nSome fans, however, have long believed Heckerling has herself concealed something very important about the film, namely Cher's Jewish identity. It's hard to ignore Cher's Jewish surname (Horowitz), or the mezuzah (a piece of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah) on her family's front door. Yet, until now, Heckerling has been keen to shut down theories about Cher's ethnicity, pointing out that Cher's surname was originally meant to be Hamilton, and that Horowitz came from an ad lib by Wallace Shawn (as Cher's teacher).\u00a0\nHeckerling is proud of her own Jewish roots, and as well as being in love with the Yiddish language (note Dionne's use of the word kvelling), she believes representation is incredibly important. So why, when it comes to Cher, does Heckerling not want to confirm what seems obvious? Whatever Heckerling's intentions when she was writing the script, the character we see in the film is coded as Jewish. If you know what to look for, it's as plain as, well, that mezuzah. Like someone preparing to put down heavy luggage, Heckerling sighs. \"I didn't want to say Cher was Jewish,\" she explains, because \"when you're Jewish, there's always some group that's going to be mad at you\". Another sigh. \"So you don't want to make a big thing of it.\"\u00a0\nHeckerling claims that the most autobiographical scene in Clueless is the one in which Dionne (who, like Cher, has a somewhat kamikaze approach to driving) suddenly finds herself on the freeway and freaks out. Heckerling says that she identifies with the feeling of \"not being a very secure driver and suddenly you're in this situation where cars that are very big are coming right up and honking loudly. You're afraid to change lanes, because your car doesn't have the power to zip in and out and it's very frightening. I would often accidentally find myself on the freeway, just screaming till the exit was there!\"\nThe image of Heckerling in her puny car, screaming her head off, is a comical one, but also feels like an apt metaphor for this film-maker's relationship with Hollywood. Pre-and-post Clueless, she was often made to feel as if she didn't belong in the big league (studios were stingy about budgets; bigwigs tried to bury her projects; she was continually messed around when it came to distribution). Which is crazy. Heckerling is actually responsible for two all-time classic films \u2013 her 1982 debut, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, launched the careers of Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh and successfully tackled taboo topics like teen abortion. On top of that, Heckerling created the massively successful franchise, Look Who's Talking (inspired by her own daughter, Mollie). The good news is that Clueless, an iconic juggernaut if ever there was one, has allowed Heckerling to keep going. Here she is, 30 years later, still holding her ground and her nerve.\u00a0\nShe has plenty of projects in the pipeline. She and Mollie have written a script for Look Who's Talking 4 and are now waiting for feedback. She's also researching a historical Jewish figure (\"I've made a million notes\"). And she would kill to work with Benedict Cumberbatch. Like her own, dearly departed mother (\"the original Cumberbitch!\"), Heckerling \"worships\" the British actor. \"Whenever I'm feeling crummy I'll put on Sherlock, or the Richard III he did for The Hollow Crown [BBC series of Shakespeare history plays],\" she says. \"I can't stand being in the sun. Or the desert. But if he said, 'Let's do a Lawrence of Arabia remake,' I'd be there.\"\nSerious money has been pumped into the new West End musical. In London, you can't miss the posters, which show Cher, hands on hips, in her yellow tartan suit. Heckerling is pleased with the show because it \"doesn't feel like a different animal\" to the film. \"Some characters have a little more presence than others but, if you like the film, I think you'll feel the show is telling essentially the same story\". Scottish-singer songwriter KT Tunstall, known for hits like Suddenly I See, did the score, while Glenn Slater came up with the lyrics, and their idea has been to create songs that together sound like a 90s mixtape, aping the sound of era-defining acts from Radiohead to Green Day to NSYNC. Heckerling says that she and Slater spent a lot of time working together. \"Me and Glenn would go through the lyrics, with me telling him what the characters were feeling. I'd sometimes tell him, 'Woah, she wouldn't say this!' and changes were made. But, basically, I was so pleased with what he was doing.\"\u00a0\nShe's all too aware that theatre is a different medium. \"In films, you get to do close-ups of people, you can get into their\u00a0brains. In a musical comedy, the characters have to reach the last person in the audience with a song. Hopefully people will like the songs.\"\nThe interview is almost over. So much has changed, Heckerling confides, since she made the 1995 film. She's concerned, these days, about censorship and surveillance, \"I'm worried about how much trouble you can get in to right now. It seems like Big Brother is watching everything you do.\" She calls out, mischievously, \"Hi Big Brother! We're just talking about a silly film!\"\u00a0\nMemories of those \"wonderful\" days on the Clueless set spur her on. She says that many of her friends aren't working and \"don't even\u00a0want\u00a0to be working\". She tuts with amazement. \"It seems very strange to me. I can't imagine not wanting to\u2026\" She searches for the right word, keen as ever to avoid sounding presumptuous or highfalutin. She says, \"I will always want to be\u00a0creating. That's why you're alive, right?\"\nClueless, The Musical is London's Trafalgar Theatre until 27 September 2025.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass. \nWhen asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.\" \nHowever, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.\nIn public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops. \n\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.\nAccording to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.\nPresident Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests. \nHe suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?\nThe short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.\nBritain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending. \nBut Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.\nInstead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.  \nThat force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.\n\nBut these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".\nOfficials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nIt could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.\nWhile Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.\nEuropean nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics. \nNato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough. \nBut the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.\nEurope's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.\nFrance is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.\nSir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.  But as for Donald Trump's question - would  Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no. \n",

        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy was appointed Leicester boss on 29 November\nBefore Leicester City won the Premier League title in 2016, they pulled off one of the greatest of great escapes to avoid relegation to the Championship.\nA repeat of that looks very unlikely this time - even though their current situation is not as precarious. \nBack in 2014-15 they were rooted to the foot of the table for much of the season, only climbing off it in April as a run of seven wins from their final nine games took them to unexpected safety.\nBut this Leicester team look barely capable of winning one game, let alone going on a run of victories, as Thursday's 2-0 loss to West Ham left them five points adrift of safety.\n\"We are going to get up again,\" vowed boss Ruud van Nistelrooy after the game.\n\"We are still in this fight, mathematically we are there and we keep fighting as long as we can. \n\"It must be clear that the fight was only one half today and that is not enough.\"\nLeicester sacked Steve Cooper on 24 November with the club 16th after 12 league games, but the change has not had anywhere near the impact the Foxes would have hoped - and the statistics make for concerning reading:\nThe Foxes have lost 11 of their past 12 Premier League games (won one).\nIn his 14 games in charge, Van Nistelrooy has picked up just seven points, three fewer than previous boss Cooper managed this season (10 in 12 games).\nNo side has conceded more own-goals in the Premier League this season than Leicester (three, level with West Ham and Wolves).\nLeicester have also failed to score in each of their past four Premier League games, last doing so in February 2017 (a run of six).\nOn Leicester's struggles to score, Van Nistelrooy added: \"If you play like this in the first half you are not going to score. We were not even close to scoring. \n\"In the second half we were much closer to score. At least you give yourself an opportunity.\"\nIn Leicester's favour, however, is time. \nA five-point deficit is not insurmountable and they have 11 league games left - that's 33 points to play for.\nBut their upcoming run of fixtures looks tough with their next four games being trips to Chelsea and Manchester City and home matches against Manchester United and Newcastle.\nLeicester defender Wout Faes says the players still believe they can stay up.\n\"Of course, there has to be belief,\" the Belgian said.\n\"Weekend after weekend the games count down. I don't think we have to think too much about going forward. \n\"We just have to think game by game and we have to start winning very soon because the games are counting down.\"\nThose who have watched some of their recent games, however, are not so optimistic.\nFormer Leicester midfielder Neil Lennon said on TNT Sports: \"I hate to say it about any group of players but it is really hard to make a case for them on what we have seen. \n\"West Ham didn't have to be anywhere near their best to win the game comfortably.

I don't think we have to think too much about going forward. \"We just have to think game by game and we have to start winning very soon because the games are counting down. \"'I think they are gone' - but can Leicester escape?In Leicester's favour, however, is time. Back in 2014-15 they were rooted to the foot of the table for much of the season, only climbing off it in April as a run of seven wins from their final nine games took them to unexpected safety.But this Leicester team look barely capable of winning one game, let alone going on a run of victories, as Thursday's 2-0 loss to West Ham left them five points adrift of safety.",

I knew I was not Messi or anyone, I was Bojan. \n\"But when people demand for you to be at that level, it is difficult to live with that expectation.  \n\"It was difficult to find a way.\"\nEuro Leagues: An interview with Bojan, & the Magic of the Cup\nBojan's career appeared to be skyrocketing. \nIn February 2008, only a few months after making his first-team debut at Barcelona, he was called up by Spain to play in a friendly against France.\nBut his international debut was delayed as he withdrew, and then declined an invitation to be part of the Spain squad for Euro 2008 - a tournament they went on to win.\nIllness and personal reasons were cited at the time for him pulling out of both but a decade later, Bojan says he was suffering from anxiety issues.\n\"As a football player the people do not know what is behind the football bit,\" he added.\n\"In the moment I suffered a lot but at the same point I knew it was something that was making me strong. \n\"At the end of my career I wanted to tell my story, but not as Bojan the footballer but Bojan the human, because I know this is a story that can not only help football people but also in general. \n\"As soon as I told my story I felt I closed all the experiences.\"\nBojan played for Stoke between 2014 and 2019\nBojan had three more seasons at Barcelona, but he struggled to match those early expectations and had spells away from the club with Roma, AC Milan and Ajax.\nBut in 2014 he decided to sever ties completely with Barcelona and opted to pursue the opportunity of playing in the Premier League by signing permanently for Stoke.\n\"It was one of the first big decisions I made in my career,\" Bojan said. \"It was to cut the umbilical cord with Barcelona after 12 years. \n\"I decided to do it because I knew it was the right decision, but in the moment it was hurting me a lot.\"\nHowever, the anxiety issues that Bojan had been struggling with became so difficult that he was unable to fly out to join up with Stoke, despite having boarded the plane to leave Spain.\n\"The plane was going to the sky but I was feeling 'wow, I cannot fly' and that is why I stopped the plane,\" he said.\nBojan returned home but was able to fly the following day and linked up with the Stoke squad at a training camp in Germany.\nAt the Potters he made 53 appearances in the Premier League, scoring 14 goals, and it is a move that he credits as one of the best of his career.\n\"For me, Stoke gave me a big opportunity to play for them and in the Premier League,\" he said.\n\"We built one of the biggest moments in Stoke's story. The fans and the players will always be in my heart and I've always said my top level in my career I did with them.\"\nBojan may not have been the next Messi but he was forging an impressive career at Stoke, with his form leading to links with moves to Liverpool and Manchester United.\nBut a serious knee injury in January 2015 disrupted his progress and he was never the same again. Spells at Mainz and Alaves followed before he finished his career in Japan, retiring in 2022.\nThe following year he returned to Barcelona, taking on the football co-ordinator role, and while he may only be a couple of years older than some of those in the current first-team, he is enjoying his new life off the pitch.\n\"I don't miss playing football,\" he said. \n\"I feel that was the end of a chapter in my life, I felt proud about what I did and what I learned from the good and the bad experiences. \n\"I see the players now when they are training and playing and I feel already I did this, and now I am on another step and looking forward.\"\nListen to the full interview with Bojan Krkic on the Euro Leagues podcast on BBC Sounds.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola suggested Manchester City have a \"1%\" chance of qualifying\nPep Guardiola strode into the Bernabeu Stadium's palatial surroundings knowing Manchester City must overturn the odds - and logic - in a special place that usually reserves its miracles for Real Madrid.\nHe has known every emotion in this legendary arena on a Champions League journey that has brought him here with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nAnd on Wednesday, Guardiola will once more appear alongside his friend and great adversary, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, beneath those towering stands knowing victory will rank among his finest achievements.\nGuardiola rates City's chances of overturning a 3-2 deficit from the first leg of this play-off to reach the last 16 as \"1%\".\nAnd, to gauge the opinions of locals in a city that has held more Champions League victory parades than any other, they feel Guardiola is erring on the side of optimism.\nGuardiola was in measured mood when he appeared in front of the media at the Bernabeu, an environment that represented enemy territory during his time as  player and coach with Barcelona - and his message was crystal clear.\n\"We have to make it almost the perfect game,\" he said. \"We have to attack. We have to score goals. This is the idea.\"\nGuardiola is determined City will not leave the Bernabeu wondering or with regrets, saying: \"We must play with courage. We must be ourselves. It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Households will need to make significant changes to their lifestyles to help the UK reach net zero by 2050, says the government's independent climate advisers.\nIn its latest advice, known as the carbon budget, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says by 2040, 80% of cars should be electric and one in two homes have a heat pump.\nHere are some of the ways it says you can cut greenhouse gas emissions: \nDecarbonising home heating will be essential if the country is going to reach its legally binding net zero target by 2050.\nOur homes are the second biggest source of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions after transport, and 80% of those emissions are from gas boilers. The proportion has been increasing as the country generates more electricity from low-carbon technologies like renewables and nuclear.\nThe CCC is backing heat pumps as the main replacement for gas boilers and rules out using hydrogen.\nIt says only about 60,000 UK homes installed a heat pump in 2023. It wants that figure to be 450,000 by 2030 and 1.5 million by 2035. \nHowever, it recognises that is going to be difficult. A key problem is heat pumps are typically more expensive than gas boilers, even after the government's \u00a37,500 grant. And because they heat water to a lower temperature than boilers, they work better in well-insulated homes with larger radiators or underfloor heating.\nThe committee says the government needs to consider schemes to help lower income households cover at least some of the costs of these changes.\nThe hope is that as boilers break down, consumers will replace them with heat pumps. The report doesn't recommend a ban on new boilers but says by 2035 all new heating systems should be low carbon.\nA quarter of UK emissions come from transport \u2013 excluding aviation \u2013 making it another priority for carbon cuts. But the CCC is less worried about how these will be achieved.\nThat is because it believes continuing reductions in the cost of batteries and other technologies mean electric cars and vans (EVs) could be cheaper to buy than petrol and diesel vehicles as soon as next year. This is significantly cheaper when you take into account running costs. It believes we will naturally choose them when we're looking for a new car.\nIn 2023, 16% of new cars were fully electric - the government says that will be 55% by 2027 and 95% by 2030.\nThe CCC says government will need to support the rollout of the charging network, and that the cost of charging needs to fall and payment be simplified.\nIt expects the switchover will become increasingly rapid, partly because it believes it will become more difficult to buy petrol and diesel, as it is expected there will be fewer petrol stations by 2040. \nWe are going to need to change our diets, the CCC says. That is because agriculture is the fourth highest emitting sector in the UK economy and nearly two-thirds (63%) of those emissions are from livestock.\nHowever, the CCC is careful not recommend restrictions on what we eat. Instead, it anticipates the current slow drift towards more plant-based foods will continue in the years to come. By 2040 it estimates we will be eating 25% less meat and 20% less dairy.\nMeat products will initially be replaced by existing alternative protein products like plant-based burgers, but in later years it expects us to start eating more \"alternative proteins\".  These include oils and meat grown from animal cells in bio-reactors - fermentation tanks like you might see in a brewery. The first product using these cultivated meats for animal consumption went on sale earlier this month.\nOur changing diets will mean cattle and sheep numbers will need to fall by 27% as a result, it says. That will allow a shift towards woodland creation, the restoration of the country's peatlands and allow more land to be used to grow energy crops.\nUK farmers will need to be supported during this transition, it advises, and the government will need to be careful to ensure that low-carbon UK food is not just replaced by higher-carbon products imported from abroad.\nAviation is currently the sixth biggest source of UK emissions, but by 2040 the CCC reckons it will be the biggest.\nIn the past the committee has advised government there should be no expansion of UK airports without a clear plan to cut emissions from the sector. The government is expected to announce its support for a new runway at Gatwick on Thursday, so is likely to be relieved the CCC has dropped that recommendation from this latest carbon budget.\nBut it says the aviation industry will need to pick up the tab for the costs of decarbonising the sector. That is going to require technological innovation \u2013 more efficient jets and electric planes \u2013 and the increasing use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).\nSAF is made from plant products or by combining captured CO2 with hydrogen. Just 1% of jet fuel is currently SAF, but the CCC expects that to rise to 17% by 2040.\nAny emissions the industry cannot eliminate will need to be offset by what the CCC calls \"engineered removals\". That means using technologies to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it permanently underground.\nAll of which is going to be expensive and will drive up ticket prices. The CCC expects those higher prices will slow down the increase in passenger numbers in years to come. However, it still expects a 28% increase in passenger numbers by 2050 \u2013 with UK residents taking a total of 402 million flights a year.\nIt has a warning though. If all that new tech doesn't cut emissions as much as the industry is expecting, the government may need to impose limits on flight numbers.",

        "article_text": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of J\u00f8rn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it \u2013 the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\u00a0\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\u00a0\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A\u00a33.5m or A$7m \u2013 at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 \u2013 the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\u00a0\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A\u00a312.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors \u2013 the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\u00a0\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\u00a0\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (\u00a351m).\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The first ever video game console\n\u2022\u00a0How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe\n\u2022\u00a0How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (\u00a333m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Bj\u00f6rk\u00a0and Massive Attack. In 1980,\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Dwarshuis 3-47Australia 109-1 (12.5 overs): Head 59* (40); Azmatullah 1-43Match abandoned because of rainScorecard; TablesAustralia qualified for the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy at the expense of Afghanistan as their match in Lahore was abandoned following heavy rain.Sediqullah Atal's composed 85 helped Afghanistan post a competitive, if not especially threatening, total of 273 on another batter-friendly surface at the Gaddafi Stadium.His 95-ball innings included three sixes and six fours, while Azmatullah Omarzai contributed a brisk 67 off 63 balls, hammering five sixes.Ben Dwarshuis finished as the pick of Australia's bowlers with 3-47, while fellow left-arm seamer Spencer Johnson and leg-spinner Adam Zampa picked up two wickets each.Perhaps with an eye on the weather forecast, and any possible revised total under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, Australia began the chase with real intent.Opener Travis Head rode his luck and punished Rashid Khan's drop off Fazalhaq Farooqi at the start of the fourth over, when he was on six, by whipping the Afghanistan quick over the ropes for a maximum the next ball.Head raced to 59 in 40 balls and, with 165 runs needed from 37.1 overs, he and Steve Smith looked well set for Australia before a heavy downpour left pools of water on the outfield and conditions unplayable.The result means Australia have four points and will go through as winners of Group B if England beat South Africa in Karachi on Saturday.Afghanistan can mathematically still reach the semi-finals but it would require a huge victory by England to enable them to overhaul the Proteas' net run rate.Should South Africa triumph - or if their game is washed out - they will progress as group winners and Australia will go through as runners-up.Both semi-finals and the final have reserve days should they be affected by weather.Australia's replacements impressThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Johnson strikes early for AustraliaShorn of a trio of injured frontline seamers, there were question marks over whether one of cricket's traditional tournament heavyweights would carry sufficient punch in the bowling department.Replacing Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood -  who boast a combined 308 ODI appearances and 525\u202c wickets - appears on paper no easy feat for Australia.Nathan Ellis, Johnson and Dwarshuis had a collective 17 ODI caps before this match, but despite not being household names they are grizzled operators.Dwarshuis and Ellis are both 30, Johnson is 29, and all three showed short-format skills and nous garnered from the domestic franchise circuit.On the back of scores of 351, 356, 325 and 317 at the Gaddafi Stadium in the Champions Trophy so far, none of the bowling trio looked remotely flustered when Afghanistan sailed to 91-2.Johnson's menace at the start saw him remove the dangerous Rahmanullah Gurbaz for a duck with a toe-crushing yorker before he later snared Sediqullah.Dwarshuis, meanwhile, held his nerve well at the death as his excellent line drew false shots.It is not that long ago that Johnson, who holds an Italian passport through his grandfather, was set to throw his lot into Italy's bid to make a T20 World Cup, while Dwarshuis was investigating his eligibility to represent the Netherlands.Both of them - along with Ellis - now look to have a major role in Australia's attempt to win a third Champions Trophy title and their first since 2009.Smith reacts to Bairstow-esque momentThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'Really good sportsmanship'- Smith calls off reviewThere was a moment of Australian sportsmanship in the 47th over of Afghanistan's innings.In echoes of the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow during the 2023 Ashes, Australia wicketkeeper Josh Inglis whipped off the bails when Noor Ahmad left his ground.Noor had stepped out from the crease before the end of the over had been called following the completion of a single.Standing umpire Kumar Dharmasena had just started to signal to the third umpire to review the incident, and another controversial dismissal looked to be on cards.However, Australia captain Smith interjected and decided to withdraw the appeal for a run out.Afghan players know things are 'not correct' - TrottPublished3 days ago'Stay true to your heart and mind' - Bavuma on mental resiliencePublished1 day agoAustralia complete 'first objective'- reactionThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Head scores 59 against AfghanistanAustralia captain Steve Smith: \"We tried to keep things simple, and tried to take wickets throughout the middle order. 270 was good on this wicket but we didn't start well when it came to bowling.

Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

It's absolutely amazing,\" Hannah said. \nBass player Emer McLaughlin was equally thrilled at the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\"I'm so incredibly excited and honoured to be supporting giants Snow Patrol in the SSE Arena.\n\"This has been a literal dream come true for us as an upcoming band in so many ways.\n\"It's such a landmark venue - it's our first ever arena show - and to be supporting a fellow Irish band like Snow Patrol just makes it such an unbelievable experience.\"\nThe members of CHERYM say that when it comes to the music industry they, like many other young bands, need as much exposure as possible in order to progress in a very competitive industry. \n\"This is probably the biggest level of exposure we've ever had,\" says Alannagh.\nAlthough CHERYM are signed to a small independent record label called Alcopop Records, who they say are so artist-friendly, Alannagh says it is \"extremely difficult\" to make a name for yourself.\n\"I saw an article by Sam Fender where he was speaking about the music industry very recently and how ninety per cent of it are people who come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds.\n\"Whereas for a working-class band it is very, very difficult to do that.\"\nAlannagh explained that CHERYM's members rely on funding and other support \"to actually be able to pay our petrol money on the way home and to be able to make a living out of this\".\n\"Some of us have full time jobs in order to make this work,\" she said.\n\"So we have to have a second job in order to pursue our actual passion.\"\nThe band are delighted that Lightbody likes their music and described the support from Snow Patrol's members as \"very reassuring\".\nCHERYM have also toured with The Undertones and say it was an experience they will never forget as the popular Derry band took them under their wing.\nThey even got to perform the famous anthem Teenage Kicks live on stage with them.\n\"It was so fun. They were like Derry das on tour,\" says Alannagh.\n\"Everybody was sitting together to have dinner before the show and they invited us up on stage to play Teenage Kicks with them which was extremely exciting.\"\nSpeaking before the Belfast show, Hannah said she was extremely nervous about playing support to Snow Patrol but would \"love every minute\".\nDuring the gig, Lightbody dedicated Snow Patrol's performance of Chasing Cars to the band's support acts CHERYM and Nina Nesbitt.",

That is why this claim is completely artificial against my clients.\"\nHe asked the court to strike out the claim against the band members as individuals and for it to proceed against the company only.\nIn written submissions for FSA, Andrew Burns KC, said The 1975 - who were due to be paid 350,000 dollars (\u00a3274,000) for a one-hour performance - \"deliberately behaved in a way to challenge and provoke the Malaysian authorities\".\nThe band first played the festival in 2016, agreeing at the time not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, he noted.\nBut they \"planned provocative conduct\" in 2023, which included a bottle of wine being \"smuggled\" on stage, a \"second-rate set of songs\" to \"punish and upset the Malaysian audience and authorities\" and an \"obscene speech\"; as well as the kiss which courted much publicity online, the submissions claimed.\n\"This is also a case where they could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" he said in the document.\n\"It is therefore fair, just and reasonable for the duty of care to be imposed and for them to answer for their acts of procuring breaches of contract.\"\nThe court heard that Malaysian authorities had initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy's recent recovery from drug addiction.\nBut they agreed to allow the performance to take place after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, Mr Burns added.\n\"The band should be held liable as the loss was caused by their intentional misbehaviour breaching the express assurances that were given which gave rise to their personal duties of care and their responsibility for their own personal behaviour.\"\nThe court hearing is expected to conclude on Wednesday.\nIn footage shared online, Healy could be seen telling the crowd that the band's decision to appear in Malaysia had been a \"mistake\".\n\"When we were booking shows, I wasn't looking into it,\" Healy said. \"I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.\n\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued. \"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"\nHealy and MacDonald then kissed as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.\nSoon after - just 30 minutes into the set - Healy and the band walked off stage, with the singer telling the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"\nAfter their Malaysian festival appearance was cut short, the band cancelled further concerts in Indonesia and Taiwan.\nHealy's protest stunt sparked backlash from some LGBT activists and allies in the country, with many calling it an act of \"performative activism\" that would make their lives even harder. Some said it displayed a \"white saviour complex\".\nIn a statement after the show, a source close to the band said Healy had wanted to stand up for the LGBT community.\nSeveral months later, Healy defended the move in a 10-minute speech delivered at a 1975 concert in Dallas, Texas.\nHealy said the kiss was \"not a stunt simply meant to provoke the government\" but an \"ongoing part of the 1975 stage show which had been performed many times prior\".\nHe described online anger over the performance as \"liberal outrage\", and said criticism of the band for \"remaining consistent\" by performing its \"pro-LGBT stage show\" was puzzling.",

        "article_text": "The Baltic Express bursts out of the Czech capital on a crisp winter morning. As the sky lightens, medieval Prague is streamed through the train's windows like a Netflix trailer. From armchair seats in private compartments, a city of Rococo castles and wide boulevards appears: the \"Paris of the East\", mostly unscathed by Nazi occupation in the 1940s or socialist planning in the 70s. Moments later the train hums through a timeless Czech countryside. Onion-domed churches and frozen fishing lakes scroll past as the train sprints north.\u00a0\nThe recently launched route from Prague to Gdynia on Poland's Baltic coast operates four times daily, and takes travellers directly into Central Europe's most vibrant and less-touristed cities that were previously tricky to get to. It will entice international travellers who want to combine a city break with a rural experience, followed by a holiday on the beach.\nThe term \"Baltic Express\" is an ambitious misnomer. Think of this new 878km connection not as one of the speedy plane-killer routes trending in recent years \u2013 like London to Amsterdam or Istanbul to Ankara \u2013 custom-built to compete with budget airlines. Instead, the eight-hour trip promises a scenic history tour through overlapping empires via some of the Czech Republic and Poland's most buzzing cities, including Gdansk and Poznan. Best of all, this highly affordable and experiential journey allows passengers to hop-on and hop-off wherever they choose.\nMy own journey started in Prague's Hlavn\u00ed N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed station. From outside, the terminus looks like a cathedral to train travel with twin cupolas rising from its roof like Roman temples. The station was built in 1871 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which ruled Central Europe, laid train tracks around the empire as a way of weaving all trade and security through the empire's capital of Vienna.\nInside the station, N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Hlavn\u00ed's main departure hall was decorated when the Czech Republic was\u00a0under Soviet domination and is a socialist rainbow of primary colours. Yet unbeknown to most passengers, one floor above sits an original waiting room styled in Art Nouveau, while a soaring dome in this higher level overlooks Romanesque statues and polished brass rails. In 2024, the fancy Foyer Caf\u00e9 opened in an adjoining salon, serving Czech riesling and viennoiserie pastries high above the hoi polloi. It's a fine way to start a continental meander.\nAfter just one hour aboard the Baltic Express, I make my first hop-off stop at Pardubice. The 100,000-person city exudes Czech charm. The old town square is Prague-esque, with church steeples shaped like space rockets and townhouses coloured every shade of pastel. Pardubice's Austro-Hungarian townhouses are as fancily familiar as in every empire city: Sarajevo, Brno, Lviv. Yet I can count that day's tourists on one hand.\nTrain Journeys\nTrain Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\nIronically, statues in Pardubice commemorate the birthplace of Czech aviator Jan Ka\u0161par. In 1911, Ka\u0161par flew south from Pardubice to Prague, following the railway tracks now used by the Baltic Express. The mechanical efficiency of aviation has competed with the romanticism of rail ever since.\nI rejoin the Baltic Express an hour before sunset. The topography rises towards the Polish border in an undulating green sheen. First oak woods, feral deer and icy streams. Then pine forests, hunting lodges and deep snows as the train climbs into the quickening night. As Europe has become borderless, only a choral chirp from passengers' cellular networks welcomes our train to Poland.\nI share my seating cabin with a woman named Marta Kortas who works in Gdansk's data analytics industry. \"The train has made a new connection for me because I have friends in Prague and southern Poland,\" she tells me. The region of rural Silesia flashes past in the dark, where passengers can get off for thermal springs and salt mines. Kortas lived here during Covid lockdown. \"I even dreamt I could move back and use the train to commute to my office a few days per month. Direct connections between Prague, Wroclaw and Poznan makes that dream much easier.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities\n\u2022\u00a0 Europe's stunning high-tech luxury train\n\u2022\u00a0 The Train d'Artouste: Europe's highest narrow-gauge train\nAround 20:00, I alight, alongside Polish business commuters, to spend the night in Wroclaw, Poland's historical third city. For nearly a century before 1945, Wroclaw was the German-speaking city of Breslau, and its Teutonic-Gothic train station was designed by a Prussian architect. After World War Two, however, Poland's borders shifted west and the train station formerly known as Breslau Hauptbahnhof was renamed Wroclaw Glowny \u2013 although direct services still run to Berlin on tracks laid by the German Empire more than a century ago.\nI wake up to Wroclaw's whirling snow and reboard the Baltic Express for the third time, strolling along the length of the eight-carriage train to gauge the passenger make-up. There are bike racks and bench tables, a dining car and coffee bar, occupied by everyone from Polish grannies to Czech work-from-homers. It's the mix anticipated by Jan Hrab\u00e1\u010dek of Czech national rail operator \u010cesk\u00e9 Dr\u00e1hy, whom I speak to en route.\n\"We already have a connection from Prague to Budapest and Warsaw,\" says Hrab\u00e1\u010dek, who helped develop the Baltic Express route. \"So the idea of the Czech and Polish transport ministers was to connect the quickest possible route from Prague and Wroclaw to the sea.\" Tourism, not business, will be the key summer driver: Czechs used to drive south to Croatia for holidays, says Hrab\u00e1\u010dek, but now it's expensive. \"Czech people 'found' Poland as a destination because the beaches are great and the weather has become warmer.\"\u00a0\nThe joy of the Baltic Express is that it affords a few hours in destinations one might otherwise overlook, like the Polish spa town of K\u0142odzko or the medieval city of Leszno. I make my penultimate pitstop in Poznan, a Polish cultural capital that has an old town square as pretty as any imagined in a Disney fairytale.\nI start in the square's Military Museum, where rakish Napoleonic tunics and dashing air force costumes \u2013 Polish soldiers knew how to dress \u2013 tell of a darker story. Poland has only enjoyed 50 years of independence in the last two centuries due to Austro-Hungarian, Nazi and Soviet occupiers, which makes the safeguarding of the country's culture during difficult times even more impressive.\nPlan your journey\nThe Baltic Express stops at more than 20 exciting destinations, including two Unesco World Heritage sites. Break up the journey be spending a night or two in a charming Central European city en route or stop off for a few hours of sightseeing or lunch in one of the smaller towns \u2013 then jump back on the four-times-daily service. Book individual tickets via the Czech or Polish national train operator websites. Alternatively, an Interrail pass offers unlimited hop-on hop-off travel.\nFor example, the interiors of the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help look like a darkly atmospheric Vatican with a ceiling as kaleidoscopically intricate as a Faberg\u00e9 egg. I learn that the Nazis turned the basilica into a warehouse before it was restored after World War Two. Meanwhile, Poznan's magnificent brick brewery, Stary Browar, a city in itself, was mothballed during the Soviet era. It has been reborn as a cultural space and shopping hub near the train station.\nAt lunchtime, I embark on my final leg towards Gdansk. As a board the train, a conductor I met the day before gives me a nod of welcome. The Baltic Express is starting to feel like home.\nThe cosiest space is the dining car. A chef grills fresh go\u0142\u0105bki (pork-stuffed cabbage leaves), her assistant spoons out pumpkin barley with kale and the waiter decants bottles of \u0141om\u017ca beer. The train catering company WARS holds a special place in Polish hearts, having catered on international rail routes from Irkutsk to Istanbul since 1948. It's a long way from a British Rail sandwich.\nA fellow diner is marketing consultant Karolina Paszkiewicz. \"The trains Poland had 10 years ago were slow and cold,\" she recalls. The train to Gdansk, where Paszkiewicz's clients are based, used to take nine hours from her hometown of Wroclaw. \"Today it's four and half,\" smiles Paszkiewicz, as she munches on a Polish apple pie. \"After you've eaten and opened your laptop, it's time to get off.\"\nWe're nearly at the end of the line. Outside, the landscape freezes and flattens. A whirl of seagulls intimates that we're descending towards the sea. The natural port of Gdansk has been Poland's window on the world for seven centuries. As a member of the Hanseatic trading league, the port city exported goods around the Baltic Sea between Hamburg, Riga, Bergen and Bremen. Visible from our slowing train are handsome wharf houses where beeswax, amber and furs could be winched up from passing ships.\nIn Gdansk, history is inescapable. The train terminal is a mirror of Colmar station in France's Alsace region, both designed by German architects when Imperial Germany governed these parts. The city's Museum of the Second World War shares how the first shots of one of Earth's greatest conflicts were fired right here. Finally, the European Solidarity Centre highlights Gdansk's shipworkers' role in helping to bring down Soviet communism decades later.\nWhat makes the Baltic Express special is its sense of interconnectedness. It's a Czech-Polish train, travelling on tracks laid by Austrians and Germans that offers the freedom to eat, sleep and explore en route. Experiential train travel has a new destination.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly noted that K\u0142odzko is in the Czech Republic. This has now been fixed.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home.

The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The legendary actor tells Katty Kay that his parents would have much rather he became an accountant or insurance broker, but finally came around when they saw him perform on stage.\nWith a shelf filled with awards, including Screen Actors Guild trophies, Emmys, a Golden Globe, a Tony and a pair of Olivier Awards, 86-year-old Sir Derek Jacobi has proven to be much more than \"the classical Shakespearean actor of our generation,\" as BBC special correspondent Katty Kay describes him during an interview at his home in London.\nSir Derek credits a serendipitous combination of luck and talent for his decades-long career, which includes roles in blockbusters like Gladiator and its 2024 sequel, and stints on sitcom Frasier, for which he won the 2001 Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a comedy series.\n\"Somehow, I was born to be an actor. That's what I feel. There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. He was born in north-east London to a father who ran a sweet shop and a mother who was a secretary. \"That's what I wanted. That's what I thought I could do. That's what I enjoyed.\"\nEnjoying the spotlight was just a part of his success. Sir Derek notes that after he found himself at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (which he affectionately calls the Rep) in 1960, there wasn't anything else that matched the euphoria of basking in an audience's applause. It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped for. Like most, they'd expected their son to go into a field with stability, like accounting or insurance.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"I always thought\u2026 I wanted to be an actor. I had no talent for anything else,\" he says. \"Hamlet confirmed it.\" After reciting one of the doomed prince's monologues to Kay, Sir Derek admits that most of his roles have disappeared into the ether, but the work of the Bard has stayed with him since those early performances almost 70 years ago. \"All the other parts have gone. Hamlet's still around. Shakespeare stays.\"\nSir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens. But he's as quick to note that he didn't have the classical training many of them had. He tells Kay that it was a bit of luck that led to his successes, which include being knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II and earning the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\"I think there's talent and I think there's luck. Without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own,\" he says. \"You've got to have the opportunity to show you've got talent. Without that opportunity\u2026 nobody's seeing it.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\u00a0\nAnother obstacle Jacobi notes was the fact that he was never seen as classically handsome. \"They had a head start because they were nice to look at,\" he says of Stephens and Olivier, while he credits being able to hone his craft in front of an audience from the age of 17 as what set him apart. He tells Kay that luck landed him that first job and his time at the Rep stood in for drama school. \"It was a huge learning experience.\"\nAnd although Sir Derek says he hasn't stopped learning, he works at a different pace now, and has learned to find new ways of working.\n\"You slow down,\" the 86-year-old says. \"It's more difficult to remember lines. I used to have a very sharp brain. I don't anymore. That, obviously, is age.\" These days, he has some help with those lines via an earpiece just in case, with Kay likening it to a skier using a knee brace.\u00a0\n\"I've really had a charmed life,\" Sir Derek says, reflecting on his career, his long-time husband, theatre director Richard Clifford, and the fact that he can still do what he loves. Sir Derek's upcoming projects include appearances in episodes of Doctor Who Unbound and Good Omens as well as films The Vampyre: Blood & Ink, with Malcolm McDowell and action-comedy Tinsel Town, alongside Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\"I can't complain about anything in my life.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Buttler made 21 in his final outing as skipper.\nThat effectively sealed England's seventh consecutive one-day international defeat by the halfway stage and South Africa took just 29.1 overs to complete their chase.\nJofra Archer took two early wickets but Rassie van der Dussen hit an unbeaten 72 and Heinrich Klaasen 64 from 56 balls as the pursuit became a procession.\nThe Proteas progress as group winners to the semi-finals, where they will play the loser of Sunday's match between India and New Zealand.\nEngland immediately head home after a torrid start to 2025.

No such performance was forthcoming.\nIn defeats by Australia and Afghanistan in Lahore, England were competitive and could easily have won both fixtures had they been better in key moments.\nThis defeat, set in motion by weak batting, ranks among their lowest moments at world events with the players seemingly beaten up by their losses across six weeks in India and Pakistan.\nThe exit and Buttler's resignation allows the rebuild to start immediately with McCullum and managing director Rob Key's first task to appoint a new captain.\nButtler's time began with victory in the T20 World Cup in Australia, at which point England were the holders of both white-ball World Cups.\nThey no longer look like contenders, never mind champions.

The former chipped a return catch to Marco Jansen, who dismissed the top three in taking 3-39, via a leading edge, while Root was bowled by seamer Wiaan Mulder.\nIn between, Harry Brook, many people's favourite to take over from Buttler, offered too much air in attempting to clear mid-wicket and was brilliantly caught by the sprawling Jansen on the boundary.\nSouth Africa's fielding was superb \u2013 Lungi Ngidi athletically catching Jamie Overton while running back from mid-on \u2013 but a frazzled England were inept in their decision-making.\nThe worst dismissal was that of Liam Livingstone, who charged spinner Keshav Maharaj, attempted a hack to leg, missed and was stumped for nine.\nButtler's final innings as captain ended in tame fashion as he looped Ngidi to mid-off. When Mulder nicked off Adil Rashid to finish with 3-25, England had been dismissed inside their allotted overs for the eighth time in 11 matches this year.\nThis video can not be played\nArcher bowls Rickelton\nEngland were never going to defend their total on a good pitch but when Archer sent down four wides in a 10-ball opening over it gave the look of a team demoralised.\nArcher bowled both South Africa openers \u2013 Tristan Stubbs with a short ball that deflected down off the glove and Ryan Rickelton by one that kept low \u2013 but conceded a further four wides in a seven-over opening spell.\nBoundaries flowed throughout with any intensity long gone from the game.\nSouth Africa had lost captain Temba Bavuma and opener Tony de Zorzi to illness for this match but still look a fearsome side.\nThat Klassen, whose century in Mumbai at the 2023 World Cup started England's fall from grace, has found form after missing the opening match with an elbow injury is a huge boost.\nHe put on 127 with Van der Dussen and cruised to a half-century, hitting 11 fours, before slicing Rashid to backward point with six runs to get.\nIndia remain tournament favourites but the Proteas, whose victory was sealed by an emphatic David Miller six, have the firepower to go all of the way.\nThis video can not be played\nBest shots from Klaasen's half-century\nEngland captain Jos Buttler: \"That was a really disappointing performance.

The wicket was quite slow, slower than we expected, and changed our initial plans. The boys adapted to the conditions out there and through that, we were able to take wickets throughout the innings and keep the momentum.\"\nOn potentially playing a semi-final in Dubai: \"We'll have to see when we get there what conditions are going to be like. We've got a great squad with great options and ultimately, we'll pick the squad to get the job done on the day.\"\nChief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special: \"A wretched performance from England and yet not necessarily unexpected. \n\"It was a dispirited team, zero confidence and the 'we can't wait to get home' attitude was evident.\"",

        "article_text": "YouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep hidden.\nYouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch?\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users \u2013 almost one in three people on Earth \u2013 and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths.\nIf we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history.\nHow many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you.\nExperts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created \u2013 a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas \u2013 is operating in the dark.\nIn part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time.\nYou might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret.\nA Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue.\n\"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\"\nBut Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example.\nSo, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet.\n\"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\"\nSo, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video.\nWhen the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is.\nThe first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos.\nZuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.\nFor many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals.\nOnly 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe.\nThose with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images.\nThe top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long.\nYouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" \u2013 but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\".\nThis narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says.\n(To identify languages, the researchers used speech recognition software called Whisper. It paints a fairly accurate picture, but makes occasional errors. For example, Whisper sometimes identifies\u00a0unintelligible sounds as Nynorsk, a written-only language in Norway.)\n\"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\"\nYouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\"\nGoogle is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\nBut YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says.\n\"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\"\nThe most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

We have to score goals. This is the idea.\"\nGuardiola is determined City will not leave the Bernabeu wondering or with regrets, saying: \"We must play with courage. We must be ourselves. It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

Next step is Champions League and now the focus is there.\"\nEven more exciting for Villa fans is the understanding he appears to be developing with Marcus Rashford, another winter window signing after the England forward joined on loan from Manchester United.\nHe provided the assist for Asensio's opener against Cardiff, meaning all three of his assists for Villa so far have been for goals scored by the Spanish midfielder.\n\"Marcus [Rashford] is a top player,\" Asensio added. \n\"We are together not so much but I know what he wants to do, where he passes and I am very happy to have Marcus and all of the team-mates.\"\nMarco Asensio has scored four goals in six games for Aston Villa\nAsensio was perhaps destined to be a footballer, with his father having named him after legendary Netherlands striker Marco van Basten.\nBut the 29-year-old has forged an impressive career in his own right. \nAfter starting out at Mallorca, he had a spell at Espanyol before joining Real Madrid, where he helped the Spanish giants with La Liga four times and the Champions League three times.\nIn total he won 17 trophies at Real, as many as a player considered one of the greatest in world football - Alfredo Di Stefano.\nAfter seven seasons at Real he made the move to French giants PSG, helping them to win a domestic treble last year.\nGiven the success he has enjoyed, joining a club not currently challenging for league titles no doubt raised an eyebrow.\nBut Unai Emery has been a long-time admirer of Asensio and played a key role in his signing.\n\"Unai has tried to get Asensio in at least three windows,\" Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.\n\"He has always said to Unai he wanted to work with him and develop with him.\"\nThe clincher for Emery appears to have been the promise of playing Asensio in the number 10 position.\n\"He hasn't played there since Mallorca,\" added Balague.  \n\"At Madrid he wasn't allowed, so that was the discussion he had with Unai. He was told number 10 and you can see the good consequences of it.\"\nAsensio is not the only player who is flourishing since moving to Aston Villa, with Rashford appearing to be putting behind him a difficult season at Manchester United with a strong start to life in the Midlands.\nRashford had been struggling for form at Old Trafford and found himself out of the picture under Ruben Amorim.\nBut the move to Villa and playing alongside Asensio appears to bringing him back to his best.\nSince his debut on 9 February, Rashford has created more chances in all competitions than any other Premier League player (13).\nAgainst Cardiff, Rashford created six chances for Aston Villa, equalling the most he ever created in any of his 426 matches for Manchester United (six vs Wigan in January 2024).\nHe has yet to score, although given his performances so far that will surely come sooner rather than later.\n\"Aston Villa have given him a lifeline,\" former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on ITV Sport. \n\"It seems to have come to an end at Manchester United. He needed to rebuild his confidence, he is 27 and has to show he has a lot to give. Villa have given him a good opportunity.\n\"Things could be very exciting here at Aston Villa with this new exciting Aston Villa forward line.\"\nWith a Champions League last-16 game at Club Brugge up next, Emery believes Asensio and Rashford maintaining their form is key to Villa achieving their ambitions this season.\n\"We need [Asensio] and we need Rashford,\" he said.\n\"We need the players who joined in the last window. We need the players coming back from injury. Every player will be necessary for the matches in the next weeks and months.\n\"Now we focus on the Champions League.

Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.\nSabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards. \nArriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.\nBetter still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set. \nA former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).\nHopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short n' Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.\nLiam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.\nGossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Zayn and Louis both on tour, that seems unlikely.\nAccording to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".\nQuoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.\n\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"\nIt's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.\n\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony. \n\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"\nHe's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.\nBut in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".\n\nWith 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT. International viewers can watch the show on the official Brits YouTube channel.\nBBC News will be live from the red carpet from 16:30GMT - with a live page providing coverage throughout the night. \nArtist of the year\nGroup of the year\nAlbum of the Year\nRead the full list of nominees here.\n",

        "article_text": "Istanbul is one of the world's biggest cities, growing larger still every year. Its rapid expansion is putting enormous stress on its water supplies.\nJodie Harburt often talks about the buzzard. In the wetlands of \u015eile, the town she lives in \u2013 absorbed many years ago into greater Istanbul \u2013 Harburt used to see a buzzard alight on the marshes beside the river, a small predatory wonder among the rich variety of birds and bugs and wildlife that called the river home.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe buzzard left, like an omen, when the municipality began to line the river with concrete.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This area is supposed to be spongy, because that's where the water is supposed to stay. It's a huge water depot,\" says Harburt. \"If you want to avoid drought situations, you have to keep the water in the soil, and you can't do that if you've lined the whole river with concrete.\"\nThe problems of one small river in \u015eile is a ripple out from the large problem that threatens to splash down on Istanbul: what happens if the city runs out of water?\nIn January 2021, the residents of Istanbul slowly, and then quickly, became inundated with ominous headlines: Istanbul could run out of water in 45 days. With reservoirs at shocking lows and little forthcoming winter rain, it was within the realm of possibility that a city of more than 15 million people might soon have no drinking water. Under the instruction of the Diyanet, Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs, Friday services at Istanbul's mosques included prayers for rain and water.\nIt wasn't the first time this has happened. Similar headlines bubble up in Istanbul's news outlets every few years. For four days in 2014, the Kadikoy neighbourhood of Istanbul had no water. At first, it was an inconvenience. In a city as large as Istanbul, water cuts occasionally happen, and residents grumble but get on and wait for the water to come back. But as the water cut extended to two days, and then three, the neighbourhood began to smell and people looked more and more frantic. By day four, there were full-blown protests as people demanded that the local government restore their water.\nNow, the warning bells are ringing again. As recently as 4 October 2024, the reservoir levels were very low, at only 37.4% capacity. In December 2023, Agriculture and Forestry Minister \u0130brahim Yumakl\u0131 announced that Turkey was at risk of experiencing extreme water scarcity by 2030, and that much of the population might feel the effect of water shortages in the next six years.\nKucukcekmece Lake, an important source of water in Istanbul, is at risk of becoming polluted and running dry. Drought is at the doorstep. Day Zero, when the water runs out, is a slow-arriving disaster that is an easy one to ignore \u2013 until it arrives.\u00a0\n\"Istanbul is already facing significant water scarcity, and we're approaching ecological limits,\" says Akg\u00fcn \u0130lhan, a lecturer who specialises in urban water management and its intersection with climate change at Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University. \"We need to face this reality, or we can continue to ignore it and face the consequences.\"\u00a0\nIstanbul is a city of water, hemmed in by it on all sides: the Black Sea to the north, the Sea of Marmara to the south, and the Bosphorus Strait bisecting the centre of the city itself \u2013 all salt water bodies, with no river to provide freshwater. As its status as a city of local and global importance has grown, the city has stretched out, swallowed its suburbs, and become very, very thirsty.\nAlways a major city, Istanbul is now a megacity, with its population ballooning in the second half of the 20th Century. In the 1950's, Istanbul had a million residents; by the 1980s, there were five million. Now, there are roughly 17 million. As the population rises, so does the demand for water; as residential areas develop on Istanbul's water basins, less water is available within the city itself.\u00a0\nIn reaction, \u0130SK\u0130, the city's water authority, has built dam infrastructure designed to bring water from villages hundreds of kilometres outside of the city into Istanbul. But when this infrastructure drains the water reservoir of these villages and damages agriculture, the residents are often forced to uproot and move \u2013 often to Istanbul, expanding its population and exacerbating the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Istanbul is fed by the whole of Turkey. It's just like sucking the blood out,\" says Harburt. \"That's what cities do.\"\nIn a city with such a long history as Istanbul, the present and perhaps the future has echoes in the past's attempts to get water to an urban centre on the sea.\n\"The city thirsts,\" wrote the Greek philospher Themistius in the 4th Century about the city that would eventually be Istanbul: a prescient observation that continues to be true. Water infrastructure from ancient times is still visible in the contemporary urban fabric of the city. One major highway cuts directly under the Valens Aqueduct, which stretches out like a rainbow above the street and dates back to Themistius's time.\nOn a grey October day, Kerim Altu\u011f wanders through the nearly empty Binbirdirek Cistern in Sultanahmet on Istanbul's historic peninsula, whose name means \"1,001 columns\" but which actually only contains about 224. \"They exaggerated, because [during the time of the Ottomans] it's completely dark, there is no electricity, completely dark, and when people enter they say, maybe it goes on for eternity,\" says Altu\u011f, an archaeologist and architectural historian with a focus on Byzantine water systems.\nWhat would become Constantinople began as an ordinary Roman town within the empire. When Constantine the Great, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, created the city 1,700 years ago, the population increased significantly over a short amount of time. To get water to the city, the imperial government created the longest Roman water supply line in the ancient world, including massive aqueducts from the forest west of the city. \"Valens Aqueduct was the longest aqueduct system ever built in all territories of the Roman Empire,\" says Altu\u011f. \"Constantinople is unique. There were probably thousands of underground cisterns built during the Byzantine period between the 5th and the 15th Century.\"\nThat history is still palpable in the modern city. There are still nearly 200 cisterns \u2013 huge vaulted caverns for storing water \u2013 that lie underneath Istanbul's historic peninsula, with many unexcavated and others, like Binbirdirek Cistern, recently restored. Istanbul's long history of managing water infrastructure for an expanding population is a portal between past and present.\nAltu\u011f touches the pillars of Binbirdirek Cistern. \"This building was built in the 5th Century, the year 400, and it's standing. Amazing! What a treasure is that. What an achievement of engineering. What an achievement of human beings' capabilities,\" he says.\u00a0\n\"It's facile to say you can learn from the past, but the experience of the past can actually be very valuable in informing practices in the present, in the future. And that's different from learning from the past,\" says Jim Crow, an emeritus professor of Roman and Byzantine archaeology at the University of Edinburgh. Crow started working in Turkey decades ago, and became fascinated with its water infrastructure during an excavation in 1994 of the Anastasian Walls in Thrace, west of Istanbul. That dig revealed an extensive network of aqueducts hidden in the thick forest.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2021, Crow teamed up with \u0130lhan and Ender Peker, an associate professor at the Middle Eastern Technical University in Ankara, Turkey, to work on a project in collaboration with the British Institute at Ankara. Together, they conducted a series of participatory action research methodology workshops with local municipalities about rainwater harvesting projects that could potentially retain more of Istanbul's water.\u00a0\n\"The main idea was actually to look at the historical pattern of water collection systems in Istanbul and explore how it was managed in the past. So one group, mainly archaeologists and historians, were working to understand the historical pattern of water management and the other group, consisting of planners and social scientists, led by \u0130lhan and me, focused on contemporary challenges,\" says Peker. \"Mainly, the idea was to learn from the past experiences and somehow modify and implement it into the current condition.\"\nThere are two main methods of rainwater harvesting: rain collected on roofs of buildings, or rain collected in large public places. Rainwater harvesting can be used to flush toilets or wash cars or irrigate gardens when collected on roofs. Larger collections can be used for Istanbul's regular street cleaning, when municipal workers come around every morning to water-blast the rubbish and dirt out of the neighbourhoods.\nRecently, legislation was passed that made it compulsory for certain buildings built on specified parcel sizes to have rainwater harvesting capabilities and greywater systems. Local municipalities can also elect to make the parcel size smaller than the required size, which allows more buildings to qualify for law, though there's resistance from building developers. \"It's a huge challenge, in terms of creating a governance mechanism among all those actors from different levels of authority,\" says Peker.\nExpanding parkland within a city can also help retain water and prevent flooding. Sponge cities are designed to soak up as much of the rainwater naturally, with parks and wetlands holding on to the water. Istanbul, however, has a fraught relationship with its parks, and much of the rainwater that falls hits the extensive concrete of the dense city streets and rolls in the sea. Cities like Los Angeles and Bangkok have benefited from concerted efforts to create more sponge city infrastructure.\u00a0(Read BBC Future's story on how one New Zealand city is transforming its water resources.)\nThe effects of Istanbul's water problems are felt on the outskirts and outside of Istanbul, before they ripple to the centre. Villages near the Melen Dam are agriculturally devastated by the water infrastructure that brings drinking water hundreds of kilometres to Istanbul, and \u015eile's concreted rivers lead to floods locally and water seeping away from Istanbul.\u00a0\n\"It becomes difficult to manage the situation as the population keeps growing. With more people, the demand for water rises. Local authorities feel obliged to cover this ever-growing demand. In fact, in Istanbul, even a one-day water cut could destabilise the government \u2013 that's how serious it is,\" says \u0130lhan.\u00a0\n\u0130SK\u0130, the city's water authority, was asked for comment on the current state of the city's water supplies but did not provide a statement before publication.\nPeker, her partner in the water workshops, agrees. \"When you absorb water like a vampire from other sources around the hinterland of the urban area, it generates really huge problems, not only water problems, but also financial and agricultural problems for the rural areas,\" says Peker.\nHarburt sees this firsthand in \u015eile, and is trying her best to address the issues locally. She and her husband Serdar started an organisation called Suda (The Sustainable Urban Development Platform), which is proposing solutions for issues related to river conservation and water management in \u015eile. One initiative is the \u015eile Oasis Project, which weds tourism, conservation and education in a \"green route\" along \u015eile's Yeni Koy River. Inspired by the Ipswich Oasis in the UK, the plan would leave a buffer zone around the banks of the river undeveloped by builders, promote ecological regeneration, and support local businesses and tourism in a sustainable manner.\u00a0\nIn late September, Suda met the deputy mayor of \u015eile to present their proposals. As the overcast day's wind rattled through the windows, the deputy mayor was intrigued, but realistic about the main issue: political will. Implementing large urban infrastructure projects can be complicated in any city, but in a hugely polarised society like Turkey, every decision refracts through the funhouse mirrors of politics.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We know we have the knowledge, we have the capacity, we have the motivation. The main challenge here is to construct this governance mechanism, because the deep political polarisation between the local authorities and the ministries is a big challenge,\" says Peker.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The drought that forced a Nepalese village to relocate\n\u2022\u00a0Barcelona's urgent search for water after floods\n\u2022\u00a0Can tree planting solve a water crisis?\nNow in \u015eile, as the natural reeds of the riverbed are being ripped up and covered with concrete, Jodie's buzzard looks more and more like a canary in a coal mine. It is one symptom of the complex problem of Istanbul's water.\n\"Climate change isn't simply about lack of water. It's about changing patterns, and how the city becomes more resilient in terms of these changing patterns,\" says Crow. \"Looking at the past, you're aware of the complexity of the number of factors, whether the political or external pressures, rather than one single sort of determinist. What always catches the headline is: this empire died of drought\u2026 [but] it's the complexity of the past that one needs to recognise.\"\nHarburt is going to continue to promote Suda and meet with local authorities and do her part in her small corner of Istanbul to move the needle, even a little. \"Optimism isn't a word I would use about any of this,\" she says. \"It's a determination to keep trying.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Inside the doping deal for tennis' world number one\nHe has won the past two Grand Slams - but less than a month after his Australian Open victory Jannik Sinner is the talk of tennis, after agreeing a doping deal which has seen him banned for three months.\nThe timing means the men's world number one will be back for the next major - the French Open. Convenient, critics say.\nThe controversial agreement between the Italian's legal team and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) officials has prompted accusations of favouritism and led to some players questioning their faith in clean sport.\nBut what really happened behind the scenes? And what impact might this case have on anti-doping?\nBBC Sport has spoken to key figures involved to establish the inside story - from the timing of the ban being \"compelling\" to the \"struggle\" of convincing Sinner to bear any ban at all when it was accepted he did not intend to cheat.\nLittle over a week ago, Sinner was practising in Doha as he prepared to play in the Qatar Open.\nBut he knew things might change quickly.\nBehind the scenes there were discussions that would rule him out of that tournament - and the next few months on tour.\nIn what ended up being a \"late night\" on 14 February, Sinner's lawyer Jamie Singer was deep in phone calls with Wada's most senior lawyer.\nThen, early the following morning, the surprise news emerged that the three-time Grand Slam champion had accepted an immediate three-month ban.\nSinner and Wada announced they had \"entered into a case resolution agreement\" over his two failed drugs tests last March.\nThis is a special mechanism that has been in place for the past four years and allows deals to be agreed to conclude doping cases.\n\"It all happened unbelievably quickly,\" Singer told BBC Sport. \"In a matter of a couple of days, really.\"\nSinner finished top of the men's world rankings in 2024 after a remarkable season where he won the Australian Open, US Open, the season-ending ATP Finals, five other ATP titles, and helped Italy win the Davis Cup\nHow do you persuade the world number one player to accept a ban for something he believes he is innocent of?\nThat was the challenge facing Sinner's team.\nTo understand the extent of that we have to rewind to August when an independent tribunal cleared him of wrongdoing.\nIt accepted Sinner's explanation that traces of clostebol - a banned anabolic steroid - had entered his system through inadvertent contamination from his physio during a massage.\nWada, while not challenging the tribunal's overall decision, appealed against the panel's ruling that Sinner \"bore no fault or negligence\".\nHowever, this would have carried a ban of \"one to two years\" at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). \nAlthough Wada initially called for this punishment publicly, eventually its officials came to feel this would not be the right outcome.\nWith time ticking before the Cas hearing in April, Wada made two approaches to Sinner's team for the case resolution agreement.\nThe first attempt was rebuffed as Sinner's team wanted to submit the full defence case first.\nThat was handed over on 31 January, and in early February the first \"concrete discussions\" began after the second approach.\nBut with Sinner always sure of his innocence and confident he would face no ban, would he accept a three-month suspension?\nHis lawyer Singer said it was \"quite tricky\" to convince Sinner to take the offer.\n\"When I was saying 'well, look, maybe we should settle for three months', he was saying 'well, why would we do that if the first independent tribunal found it was no ban at all, why would I accept three months now?',\" Singer said.\n\"My advice was 'one never knows what's going to happen at a hearing, we know that Wada are pushing for a year, if we don't accept their offer then they will go to court looking for a year and who knows what those three judges could do'.\n\"So the possibility of three months, in my view, was a good possibility.\"\nWada felt the independent tribunal should have punished Sinner for strict liability - that he was ultimately responsible for failing the two drugs tests.\nIts officials felt pursuing a suspension was key in defending the \"important principle that athletes do in fact bear responsibility for the actions of their entourage\".\nSo why was Wada happy to offer Sinner a three-month ban?\nWada's general counsel Ross Wenzel said there wasn't a \"fundamental change\" in how the agency viewed the case, but it came down to what it considered fair.\n\"This was a case that was a million miles away from doping,\" Wenzel told BBC Sport.\n\"The scientific feedback that we received was that this could not be a case of intentional doping, including micro-dosing.\"\nHad the case gone to Cas, the outcome would have either been a ban of at least a year or Sinner being cleared.\n\"I'm not sure that a sanction of 12 months in this case - if we'd have forced the tribunal into that position - or a case of 'no fault' would have been a good outcome,\" said Wenzel.\n\"One would have compromised an important principle under the code. The other one, in our view, would have been an unduly harsh sanction.\"\nCase resolutions have been allowed since 2021, and Wenzel said Wada had since struck 67 agreements.\nThe code is set to change from 2027, meaning cases where players have failed tests but were deemed not to be at fault - like Sinner - could be punished from a reprimand to a two-year ban.\n\"In two years, Sinner would simply have had a slap on the wrist,\" one source from an anti-doping organisation told BBC Sport.\nBy winning last month's Australian Open, Sinner became only the eighth player in the Open era to win each of his first three Grand Slam men's singles finals\nSome top players continue to believe Sinner has been given preferential treatment because of his status.\nBoth the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and Wada flatly reject any suggestion that is the case.\nBut it is clear Sinner - and five-time women's major champion Iga Swiatek, who received a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for heart medication trimetazidine - have benefitted from being able to pay top lawyers to act quickly.\n\"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair,\" said 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.\n\"It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers.\"\nSinner's lawyer said he thought the swift resolution of the case came down to taking an \"unusual\" legal approach.\n\"From day one [Jannik] didn't challenge the science, he didn't challenge the test, didn't challenge the rules,\" Singer told BBC Sport.\n\"He accepted, even though it's a trace - it's a billionth of a gram - he accepted that he was liable for what was in his body.\n\"And so we didn't waste time and money on all of those challenges, which traditionally defence attorneys would throw the kitchen sink at.\n\"We just focused on the evidence of what actually happened, and when we did that we managed to do that very quickly and demonstrate very plausibly what had happened.\"\nSinger was also aware that the timing of the ban was as good as it could possibly be.\n\"We can't get away from the fact that you can't choose when these things happen,\" he said.\n\"So the fact that Wada approached us and in the next three months there are no Grand Slams, that seemed to me to make their offer more compelling.\"\nSeveral players believe the timing was suspiciously convenient, with Britain's Liam Broady saying it had impacted Sinner's career as \"little as possible\".\nAsked directly why the deal had come about now, Wenzel insisted it was not taken with the tennis calendar in mind.\n\"Because of the timing of the Cas proceedings, it happened to be decided on 14 or 15 February, whatever it was, last Friday,\" said Wenzel. \"It was a very late night, and it came into effect immediately, so that is the reason for the timing.\"\nThe Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) - an organisation co-founded by Djokovic which aims to increase player power - believes there is a lack of \"transparency\", \"process\" and \"consistency\" in the system.\n\"Supposed case-by-case discretion is, in fact, merely cover for tailored deals, unfair treatment, and inconsistent rulings,\" the PTPA said in a statement.\n\"It's time for change.\"\nThree-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka, writing on social media, said he did not \"believe in a clean sport anymore\".\n'Sad day for tennis' - Sinner doping ban 'leaves sour taste'\nAre there different approaches to tennis doping cases? \nWhat happens next for Sinner after doping case?\nThis week, BBC Sport bought Trofodermin over the counter in an Italian pharmacy - the warning that it contains a drug on Wada's banned list was clearly visible\nAnother talking point has centred around why Sinner's former physio and trainer - who were both deemed responsible for clostebol entering the player's system - have not faced any action from the authorities.\nPhysio Giacomo Naldi was treating a cut on his own hand using a popular over-the-counter spray provided by fitness trainer Umberto Ferrara.\nTrofodermin is readily available in Italy for skin abrasions, cuts and wounds.\nIt contains Clostebol, a steroid that can build muscle mass and enhance athletic performance.\nNeither Naldi nor Ferrara were found by the independent tribunal to have intentionally acted to break doping rules.\nAccording to Italian law, the packaging on Trofodermin must have a visible \"doping\" warning. \nOver the past few years several Italian athletes - across tennis, football and athletics - have tested positive for clostebol.\nSinner has since parted ways with Naldi and Ferrara, but players, including Broady, have publicly questioned how the entourage of one of the world's leading players could have made such a mistake.\nWhile Sinner serves his ban, Ferrara is continuing to work on the ATP Tour with another Italian player, former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini.\nSinner is allowed to return to competitive action on 5 May - just days before the Italian Open begins in Rome, and ahead of the French Open at the end of the month.\nFrom now until 13 April, Sinner can practise at a private training base, if he does not come into contact with other professional players.\nUnder Wada rules, he can start 'official training activity' from 13 April.\nSinner is not allowed to attend any ATP, WTA or ITF events in any kind of capacity until the ban is lifted on 5 May.\nSince the news of his ban emerged a week ago, Sinner, who lives in Monte Carlo and has family in northern Italy where he grew up, was said by a member of his team to have been \"resting\" as he takes stock of the situation.\nIf he returns at the Italian Open, Sinner will likely receive a hero's reception from the home fans who idolise him.\n\"Most tennis fans here think the ban is absurd and are still supporting him. 'Sinner-mania' has not wavered,\" Italian journalist Daniele Verri told BBC Sport.\nWhether he will receive that type of support at Roland Garros remains to be seen.\nThe mood within the locker room could also be frosty, given the sceptical public reaction from many.\nHowever, a source close to Sinner said he had also received support from some of his fellow ATP players, pointing to the public comments made by the likes of Jack Draper, Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Sonego.\nAsked if Sinner was aware of - and upset by - the negative reaction from some players, the team member pointed to Sinner's repeated comments that he \"cannot control what people think or say\".\n\"Jannik is a very resilient young man, and in his own mind he knows he's done absolutely nothing wrong and the process has been absolutely by the book. So I think he's very comfortable in himself,\" Singer told BBC Sport.\n\"He keeps off social media where there are an awful lot of people with a platform, and who don't necessarily know the facts of the case, or investigate the facts of the case as much as they might do.\"\nWada believes the Sinner case has shown the system is working.\nBut it cannot duck the reality that, for as much as everyone involved might insist this case has been handled by the book, it has left some people feeling very uneasy.\nThe full fallout and ramifications of the deal may well leave a cloud hanging over the rest of the season.",

It made a difference.\"\nAccording to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.\nOne example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).\nActor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"\nThe actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.\nThough one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.\nMolly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.\nIn February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.\nColourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.\nSpeaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"\nRainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".\nIn 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.\nCarter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.\n\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.\nKemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.\nAs part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.\nFrom Wednesday, you'll be able to cast your vote here on who Denise decides her future is with, Jack or Ravi.",

He also drove in the afternoon session while Leclerc went in the morning.\nPre-season testing is a notoriously unreliable indication of true competitiveness as there are so many factors that can distort the picture.\nTeams do not reveal the specification in which they were running their cars, and fuel loads and engine modes have a major impact on performance.\nIn addition, the weather conditions on Friday were very different from the day before - Friday was sunny and considerably warmer, with a stronger wind, meaning the track was slower than it had been on Thursday.\nDespite Verstappen's pace, the Red Bull looked difficult to drive, and the team were trying out different set-ups and configurations on the car, including swapping between two different front wing specifications.\nThe four-time world champion had a spin late in the day at Turn One.\n1.

        "article_text": "England's men have won only one of their past 11 matches across three formats\nAnd so English cricket limps to its final stop of the winter.\nKarachi, where England will exit the Champions Trophy after Saturday's game against South Africa, is known as the City of Lights. Their last visit, the completion of a 3-0 Test series win in Pakistan in 2022, was Bazball's brightest moment. Now Brendon McCullum and his men cannot shake the dark clouds.\nAdele could write an album about how miserable England's 2025 has been so far. \nThe end of 2024 wasn't much better. The women dropped themselves out of the T20 World Cup and the men were spun out in Pakistan. Heather Knight's side at least won in South Africa and Ben Stokes' men claimed an impressive win in New Zealand, then soured it with a stag-do of a performance in the final Test in Hamilton.\nSince the turn of the year it has been a shambles: the women thrashed all over Australia, the men one win from 10 in McCullum's new white-ball era. Andrew Flintoff's Lions were hammered in South Africa and Australia, and the Under-19 women were well beaten in a World Cup semi-final by India. Thank goodness Archie Vaughan's Under-19 men won their Test series against South Africa.\nIt's probably good to get a few things straight before delving into this: all of us - fans, media and pundits - want England to do well. We care. It hurts when they lose.\nIt is also fair to say I have never met an England player that is not desperate to succeed. They may occasionally forget the England team exists for everyone, not just the individuals in the dressing room, but there is an understandable element of self-preservation at play. Dreams and careers are on the line. Professional sport is cut-throat.\nWe must also be careful to not rewrite history. McCullum was a breath of fresh air to English cricket, both in terms of results and the feeling towards the men's national team. It seemed a no-brainer to put him in charge of the white-ball side, largely because any other coach would have existed in the New Zealander's shadow.\nJon Lewis did similar with the women's team, even if Bazball-lite seemed too simplistic. The draw with Australia in the home Ashes of 2023 was creditable, and probably should have been better given Australia had lost Meg Lanning.\n'McCullum's problems go far beyond Buttler's future'\nEngland need more variety than just 90mph bowlers - Vaughan\nReplacing Buttler the sensible thing to do - Agnew\nAs 2024 wore into 2025 and results became indifferent for both teams, nagging doubts became worries and have now grown into genuine concerns.\nWill Ben Stokes be fully fit again? What has happened to Issy Wong? Why was Josh Hull picked? How did Flintoff go from TV presenter to some of the most high-profile coaching gigs in the country? Why did Dan Lawrence open the batting? Why did Kate Cross captain England in Ireland when it was a golden development opportunity for a youngster? Who signed off on one frontline spinner for a Champions Trophy in Pakistan? What is going on with Shoaib Bashir's bowling? Why do England women drop so many catches? We could go on and on.\nThere are recurring themes across the England national teams. The women have been accused of not being fit enough, the men of not training enough. Both charges are probably unfair, yet the players don't help their public image. \nWe're bored with hearing the men talk about golf and the women were downright daft to be pictured on a boat party during the T20 World Cup in Dubai. These England teams are not lazy, though they can be slapdash.\nThe rhetoric is maddening, too. Many legendary leaders have successfully paired public praise with private criticism, and listening to McCullum in particular can inspire even a jobbing journalist to take on the world. But some of the utterances of the men wind up fans and opposition, while the women were borderline delusional in Australia. Lewis' Bondi to Coogee walk will live in infamy, and the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook are never far from a crass soundbite.\nNone of this matters if England teams are winning. They aren't, which means Rob Key and Clare Connor - directors of cricket of the men's and women's team respectively - have thinking to do.\nIt seems a decent bet that Connor will be looking for a new women's head coach. A review into the Ashes is still taking place and could run until the end of next month. It may be that Knight stays on as captain, partly because she remains an excellent leader and partly because England's succession planning has been awful. Whoever is in charge must get the best out of Sophie Ecclestone on and off the pitch, while a bigger question is whether England have the right structural set-up to consistently compete with the Australians.\nKey's decisions on personnel are probably more straightforward. Jos Buttler sounded like a man ready to make up his own mind on the white-ball captaincy, with Brook most likely to take over. Where it gets trickier for Key, McCullum and the new skipper is reviving the fortunes of the white-ball team in a defining year for the Test side.\nThis video can not be played\nAfghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy\nOn one hand, it is harsh to compare the current white-ball team to the class of 2019, England's greatest team led by their greatest captain Eoin Morgan.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that a white-ball empire has crumbled on Key's watch. It is not his fault domestic 50-over cricket has been marginalised, but the treatment of David Willey, dropping of Sam Curran and Reece Topley, overlooking of Liam Dawson, obsession with pace over skill, lack of death bowlers and left-handed batters all fall at his door. How did England take the field in the Champions Trophy with as many wicketkeepers as frontline bowlers?\nWhereas there was once separation between the Test and white-ball set-ups, greater alignment runs the risk of a malaise from one format bleeding into the other. There is at least a decent break before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.\nUntil then, questions abound. Have England broken Mark Wood in a tournament he probably shouldn't have been playing in? What state is Stokes' hamstring in? Can Bashir become the spinner England need in Australia? Can Zak Crawley reach double figures? Is Test vice-captain Ollie Pope going to be dropped to make way for Jacob Bethell?\nNone of this gloom needs to be terminal. The women's game is about to get a huge boost from the new domestic structure and the men have every chance of winning their five-Test series against India. There is a wealth of young male and female talent coming through and the Ashes next winter has all the ingredients to be a classic.\nFor now, this winter cannot end quickly enough. Last rites and alarm bells will not be drowned out by good vibes.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "The Women's Super League returns from the international break this weekend\nAfter an international week, the Women's Super League returns on Sunday with a busy day of six matches.\nUnbeaten league leaders Chelsea resume their push for a sixth successive WSL title, holding a seven-point lead at the top with eight league games to go.\nSunday's matches are:\nManchester United v Leicester City (12:30 GMT - live on BBC iPlayer)\nAston Villa v Everton (14:00 GMT)\nCrystal Palace v Liverpool (14:00 GMT)\nTottenham v Manchester City (14:00 GMT)\nBrighton v Chelsea (15:00 GMT)\nArsenal v West Ham (17:30 GMT)\nHere are some of the talking points ahead of this weekend's games.\nThe fee Chelsea paid for Naomi Girma broke the previous world record of \u00a3685,000, when Bay FC signed Racheal Kundananji last February.\nChelsea fans have waited to see world record signing Naomi Girma make her first Blues appearance, and she may finally make her debut this weekend.\nGirma, who Chelsea signed from San Diego Wave for \u00a3900,000 in January, has yet to make an appearance as she has been recovering from a calf injury.\nBut she could be set to take to the field on Sunday, when Chelsea take on Brighton, with manager Sonia Bompastor telling a news conference on Friday that defender Girma \"should\" be in the squad.\nChelsea are seven points clear at the top of the table and are the only side still unbeaten. Their opponents, Brighton, are fifth and have not won in their past six league games.\nHowever, Brighton put up a good showing when these sides met earlier in the season and are bolstered by the return of former Chelsea forward Fran Kirby from injury.\n\"We'll go in with belief,\" said England international Kirby. \"The last game against Chelsea was probably one of the best performances of the season. Hopefully we can learn from that game. It's going to be a case of every player doing their job - and a half.\"\nLiverpool sacked manager Matt Beard after only winning four WSL games this season, while Laura Kaminski oversaw one victory in the league with Crystal Palace\nLiverpool and Crystal Palace go head to head on Sunday as the clubs begin new phases in the season after sacking Matt Beard and Laura Kaminski this week.\nLiverpool dismissed manager Beard on Thursday, with the Reds seventh in the WSL table, while bottom-of-the-league Palace announced Kaminski's exit on Friday.\nAmber Whiteley has taken interim charge of the Reds, with a search for a new manager already under way.\nWhiteley said in Friday's pre-match news conference she wants the job on a permanent basis.\n\"I will put my name in the hat, but let's get Palace out of the way first and I can think a bit longer term after that,\" she said.\n\"I am in a far better position having had the time with Matt and working under him. I'm so grateful to Matt for everything that he has given to me personally over the last three and a bit years. I'm going to miss him.\"\nPalace, who have only won one league match and collected six league points all season, said they \"will provide an update on Laura's replacement in due course\".\nManchester City are 12 points behind leaders Chelsea\nThe international break has given teams a break from regular football, but when Manchester City play Tottenham on Sunday it marks the beginning of a gruelling run of eight games in 29 days for Gareth Taylor's City side.\nThey have to contest the League Cup final, both legs of their Women's Champions League quarter-final and a league game against Chelsea, an FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, and other league games against West Ham and Brighton.\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, that manager Taylor says it will be \"really tough\" for his side to get the results they want in March.\n\"There's a lot going on in this month and I think the conversation will certainly be 'attack the next game, don't try and give too much thought to what's further down the road',\" Taylor said.\nThe situation is made even more difficult by the number of injuries in the squad \u2013 including a fresh hamstring issue for Rebecca Knaak \u2013 and players having departed.\nLaura Coombs, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood potentially completing their recoveries from injury could help, but that won't stop it being a tricky few weeks.\nRenee Slegers has not given up on Arsenal's title ambitions\nChelsea have pulled seven points clear at the top, but it remains tight between the teams who are battling for a spot in Europe.\nThe top three qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United are second with 33 points, Arsenal have 30 and Manchester City have 28.\nArsenal boss Renee Slegers has not given up of trying to pip Chelsea to the title.\n\"We need to believe that, and I do,\" she said.\n\"We have a very exciting block, full of opportunities ahead of us, and we're going to try and take those opportunities, and that's within our control.\"\nManchester United manager Marc Skinner also remains optimistic, believing that his side can go on to do \"magnificent things\".\n\"The reality is we have been going about our business under scrutiny for many years and probably forever will do. We have learned to get on with our job,\" Skinner said.\n\"There will be good times, there will be bad times. If you treat both of them the same you will be in a balanced position. If we are balanced we are a very good team that can go and do magnificent things.\"\nManchester United beat Leicester 2-0 at King Power Stadium in November\nLeicester gained only their third win of the WSL season on 16 February with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa to move up to 10th, six points clear of bottom-placed Crystal Palace.\nBut the Foxes' task could not be any tougher in the coming days, as they meet both the top two away from home in the space of four days.\nThey play on Sunday away against a Manchester United side who have won six WSL games in a row. After that, Amandine Miquel's Leicester travel to runaway leaders Chelsea, although the Foxes are the only side to take points off the Blues this season, drawing 1-1 in December.\n\"The team is ready, they are fighting,\" said Miquel on Thursday. \"We have two games so close so it will be an occasion for most of the players to play. We play opponents of good quality so we will make rotations to be able to have the best teams that we can put on the pitch.\n\"We want to go to every game like we can win.

        "article_text": "These were already turbulent times in Romania.\nBut as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.\nA country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.\nWas a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would haven't been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "Mayara Lima is famous for her hypnotising samba style. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles.\nBrazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends \u2013 at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration \u2013 the most renowned in the world.\nMore than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 official rodas de samba (samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds \u2013 or even thousands \u2013 of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, escolas de samba (community-based \"samba schools\" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect a rainha da bateria (queen of the drums) who leads the school's bateria (drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience.\nThe SpeciaList\nMayara Lima is one of Rio's most popular samba queens, having claimed the title of drum queen in 2023. She currently represents the Para\u00edso do Tuiuti samba school, where she gained national recognition for her mesmerising samba style.\nBut the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We asked\u00a0Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at Parara\u00edso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond.\nLima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. \"I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,\" she says.\nLima is a proud carioca \u2013 a Rio native. \"To me, Rio is far more than just a city,\" she says. \"What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty \u2013 its beaches and trails \u2013 with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history.\" She adds: \"[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.\"\nAhead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio.\nRio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the Samb\u00f3dromo Marqu\u00eas de Sapuca\u00ed during the festivities \u2013 but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in the quadras (samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community.\nTip:\nRio's music scene is about more than just samba. \"Baile Charme, an old-school R&B event, under the Madureira viaduct every Saturday [starts] at 20:00 and ends at the sunrise at 05:00,\" says Lima. This event has been going strong for over 20 years and remains a huge success, attracting thousands of people every week. \"It's a great way to see another side of Rio's music scene.\"\nCariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate in feijoadas (a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance.\n\"There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,\" says Lima. \"While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.\"\nFor Lima, the Gr\u00eamio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acad\u00eamicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. \"It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,\" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. \"As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,\" she says. \"It's amazing!\"\nEach school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket.\u00a0\nWebsite: www.salgueiro.com.br\nAddress: R. Silva Teles, 104 - Andara\u00ed\nPhone: +552238-9226\nInstagram: @salgueirooriginal\n\u00a0\nPedra do Sal \u2013 a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, known as Rio's \"Little Africa\" \u2013 is believed to have been the birthplace of samba in the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (sal in Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together to honour their deities and play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like the pandeiro (tambourine).\nDuring the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba.\nOnce held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday \u2013 though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration.\n\"Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd \u2013 you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,\" says Lima. \"It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.\"\nAddress: Rua Argemiro Bulc\u00e3o, s/n, Sa\u00fade,\nInstagram: @pedradosaloficial\nIn the city's northern zone, 21km from the historic Copacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at the Pagode do Chinelo roda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares.\nLike most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations \u2013 just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba \u2013 but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rio\u2019s official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event.\n\"This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner] Ludmilla performing \u2013 it's really cool,\" says Lima.\nThe event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. \"It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,\" says Lima.\nAddress: Rua Faleiros, 1, Pilares\nInstagram: @resenhapagodeechinelo\n4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos\u00a0\nThe northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba.\nTip:\nFor those looking for a more laid-back way to explore Rio, Lima recommends having breakfast inside the Jardim Bot\u00e2nico. \"Some of the cafes in the garden allow you to enjoy a morning meal surrounded by nature overlooking century-old trees,\" she says \"It\u2019s the perfect place to start your day in a relaxing atmosphere before exploring the city's other attractions.\"\nFounded in the 1960s, Cacique de Ramos became famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the \"headquarters of samba\", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture.\n\"This is where you'll find classic samba,\" says Lima. \"Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.\"\nThe samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. \"Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,\" says Lima. \"So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.\"\nWebsite: www.caciquederamos.com.br\nAddress: Rua Uranos, 1326 - Olaria\nPhone: +55213251-4374\nInstagram: @cacique_de_ramos\nBar\u00f3dromo is a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside.\n\"It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,\" says Lima. \"It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat \u2013 it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.\"\nThe venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias.\nBar\u00f3dromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service. However, the lively atmosphere and infectious energy of the crowd create a fully immersive experience, with the music at its heart.\nAddress: Rua Dona Zulmira, 41 - Maracan\u00e3\nInstagram: @barodromo\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Live mosquitoes will be exterminated using ultraviolet light.\nA total of 21 people have already claimed their reward, bringing in a total of 700 mosquitoes and larvae so far,  he told the BBC.\nThe bounty drew swift ridicule after it was announced late on Tuesday. \n\"Mosquito farming is coming,\" one social media comment read. \"Will a mosquito get rejected if it has only one wing?\" read another.\nThe Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) told the BBC that it \"appreciates the good intentions of local government executives to fight dengue\".\nIt declined further comment, however, when asked if catching mosquitoes in exchange for cash is an effective way of stopping dengue.\n\"We urge all concerned to please consult and coordinate with their local health officers or the DOH regional office in their area for evidence-based practices that are known to work,\" it said.\nMr Cernal said he was aware that the bounty had been bashed on social media, but added: \"This is one of the biggest and most dense areas.

Its symptoms include headaches, nausea, joint and muscle pain.\nPhilippine authorities have recently flagged a rise in dengue cases nationwide due to seasonal rains. The DOH said it recorded 28,234 cases on 1 February, a 40% jump from the previous year.\nThe department has advised the public to maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings, destroy potential mosquito breeding sites such as tyres, wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers and apply mosquito repellent.\nAside from dengue, the DOH said the rains have also fuelled a spike in influenza-like diseases and cases of leptospirosis, a rat-borne disease that people get when wading in flood waters.",

The Dutch expat, who has been based in West Yorkshire, UK, since 2002, is obsessed with hagelslag, carefully rationing the packets her parents post to her and the bag-loads she brings back on the ferry. \"I've got quite a lot in storage,\" she says. \"I do start to twitch when I see the end is coming.\"\nTranslated as \"hailstorm\", hagelslag are crispy, oblong-shaped sugar strands, just a few millimetres long. They are most commonly chocolate-flavoured and coated in a shiny glaze. In a supermarket in any other country, you'd likely see them in the cake toppings section reserved for a special occasion, but in the Netherlands, where more than 14 million kilograms of hagelslag are consumed per year, many people eat them every week, sprinkling them liberally onto buttered bread as a quick breakfast, snack or lunch. The hagelslag sandwich (broodje hagelslag) is surely an anachronism in this age of sugar awareness, but there's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood.\nGood hagelslag is crunchy on impact but then melts in the mouth. Each season sees new variations appear in the shops: little bunnies for Easter, for example, or orange hagelslag for Koningsdag, an annual orange-themed street party to celebrate the King's birthday. The small packs seen in many hotel breakfast buffets are ideal for novices, and a few years back, one supermarket even experimented with pick 'n' mix. Whichever variety you choose, the habit is widespread, with an estimated 750,000 hagelslag sandwiches consumed each day.\nStrictly speaking, hagelslag is a sugar-based vermicelli sprinkle that is chocolate or fruit-flavoured, but the name has become associated with other cheerfully packaged sugary toppings found on the same supermarket shelf, such as curly vlokken (chocolate flakes) and muisjes, sugar-coated aniseed seeds that look like tiny mice and are typically served on beschuit (rusks). In the 17th Century, aniseed was thought to aid lactation and help the womb contract, and pink or blue\u00a0muisjes on beschuit\u00a0are still served today to celebrate the arrival of a baby.\nFor Nicklin, whose favourite variety is the puur (dark chocolate), the crunchiness is very important. \"It's the bite with hagelslag. I don't think you can get that with any other spread,\" she says. \"It still makes me feel happy.\" She bats back any suggestion that this sweet sandwich is messy to eat, explaining that her family use high-sided plates to catch any stray strands, which she insists are returned empty. \"It's a crime to leave any on the plate,\" she says.\nThe first sugary toppings, in the form of aniseed muisjes, are thought to date to the late 19th Century when Cornelius Rutgerus de Ruijter sold them from his bakery in Baarn in the province of Utrecht. The brand, now known as market leader De Ruijter, expanded their production to factory-made fruit hagelslag in 1928 and chocolate hagelslag and flokken in the 1950s.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nEven Dutch royalty loved the sugary treat. King Willem III made the brand a purveyor of the court in 1883. And in 1985, under Queen Beatrix, De Ruijter received the Koninklijk (royal) predicate, an honour, a spokesperson from parent company Kraft-Heinz told BBC Travel, which \"can only be carried by Dutch companies who have been officially recognised for their important position within their discipline, are at least 100 years old and are considered of national importance\". Quite a fanfare for a modest chocolate sprinkle.\u00a0\nOn an industrial estate in Tilburg \u2013 a short distance from the border with Belgium, wheresprinkles are commonly called muizenstrontjes (mouse droppings) \u2212 an immense but unremarkable building houses the world's largest hagelslag factory. Photographer Jordy Leenders from Eindhoven is one of the lucky few who has seen inside. Commissioned in 2018 to take photographs of its inner workings, he said he felt, \"like I was Charlie, being invited to the chocolate factory for a tour\".\nHaving gone through a machine that rid him of dust and disinfected his hands and arms, Leenders, kitted out in ear defenders and factory scrubs, emerged into a space filled by what he describes as a kind of \"indoor rollercoaster\u2026 crisscrossing the room\" made up of \"mazes\" of vast conveyor belts moving the hagelslag through different stages of preparation to perfect their size, texture and shape.\n\"Though the smell of chocolate is strong in the early stages when you're working with a raw material, it's the noise that really hits you,\" he says, describing the sound of the hagelslag being emptied from the silos \"like pouring 2,000kg of rice into a bucket\".\nHe notes that one of the most memorable sights was the extrusion process, which creates \"a very long string of hagelslag that they break off and cut\" before spraying it with a fine mist of sugar to give it its appealing gloss. Leenders was astounded by the \"absurd scale\" of the factory and the complex processes required \"in order to deliver a decoration to put on your sandwich\". \"When you have it in your hands, you're thinking that it is pretty simple,\" he says.\nFor newcomers to the Netherlands, it's the foodstuff itself that can be baffling. Colleen Geske, who moved to Amsterdam from Canada in 2005, has a clear memory of the first time she encountered hagelslag. Her first employer in the Netherlands shared a cafeteria with various tech, finance and law firms. \"Every lunch hour, I would see these tables of men in suits that were eating what I could only describe as the lunch of a four-year-old,\" recalls the author of Stuff Dutch People Eat and co-host of the Stuff Dutch People Like podcast. \"They were all with cartons of milk and having their bread with hagelslag. To me, it was such a bizarre sight.\"\n\"Hagelslag tells us a lot about the Dutch,\" Geske adds. \"When you strip it away, the Dutch are not pretentious at all. They don't care what people think of them often\u2026 They're not over-analysing this, thinking: Is this healthy? Is this for children? They're just indulging in a relatively simple pleasure.\"\nHagelslag occupies a special place in a cuisine, which is in general, \"quite practical, quite basic\", she adds. \"Hagelslag is the one kind of sparkly, shiny, interesting, funny, kind of quirky thing about a Dutch meal.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\nBut the tradition of eating this illogical little lunch is not all about the taste, she notes. \"I think, personally, that it's also this feeling of nostalgia that the Dutch have around eating hagelslag. It's like that one thing that you grew up with as a kid that you're still 'allowed' to do as an adult.\" Due to its high sugar content, her own children are only allowed it at weekends. They're very specific about how it must be made, telling Geske: \"No, you need more butter and you have to put way more hagelslag on, and it has to be evenly distributed to the very edges...\"\nLeenders admits that the Dutch are eating \"basically a crushed chocolate bar on their sandwich\", which, he says, \"doesn't really make sense if you're looking at it from a nutritional perspective\". But that has never put him off. \"I've been raised in the Netherlands so I'm a frequent hagelslag eater,\" he says. \"I don't think you will encounter any Dutch household without at least one pack of hagelslagin their kitchen cabinets.\"\nAs far as Leenders is concerned, there's nothing childish about hagelslag. \"It's for all ages,\" he insists. \"I know people over 60 who still start their day with a sandwich with hagelslag on top of it.\"\n\"I struggle to get it in my head why they think it's for children,\" agrees Nicklin. \"My dad always had hagelslag on his bread. And she can't think why anyone would think a hagelslag sandwich makes no sense: \"If that's what they believe, then they're obviously not Dutch.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's president had been hoping to leave the White House on Friday after positive talks with Donald Trump, capped with the signing of a minerals deal giving the US a real stake in his country's future, if not an outright security guarantee.\nInstead Volodymyr Zelensky faced an extraordinary dressing down in front of the world's media, after President Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance demanded that he show more gratitude for years of US support.\nThe Ukrainian president pushed back at suggestions from his more powerful partners that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. They responded that he was being \"disrespectful\".\nZelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early before he and Trump could even take the stage for a scheduled news conference.\nAnd the minerals deal, which had been trailed and praised by both sides this week, was left unsigned. \"Come back when you're ready for peace,\" Trump wrote on social media shortly before Zelensky's car pulled away.\nThere were several major flashpoints in the meeting. Here are four of the most fiery - and the politics and feeling that lies behind them.\nWhile there was half an hour of cordial talks and formalities at the start, tensions began to boil over in the Oval Office when Vance said the \"path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy\".\n\"That's what President Trump is doing,\" he said.\nZelensky interjected, referencing Russia's aggression in the years before its full-scale invasion three years ago including a failed ceasefire in 2019. \"Nobody stopped him,\" he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you talking about? What do you mean?\" he said. \nThe exchange then became visibly tense, with Vance replying: \"the kind that will end the destruction of your country.\"\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the American media.\nIt was Vance's defence of Trump's approach to ending the war - by opening communications with Putin and pushing for a quick ceasefire - that first escalated tensions with the Ukrainian leader.\nAfter Vance challenged the Ukrainian president over problems he's had with the military and conscription, Zelensky replied: \"During the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have a nice ocean and don't feel [it] now, but you will feel it in the future.\"\nThat comment rankled Trump and drew him into the clash that up until this point had been limited to Zelensky and the vice-president.\nHere was the Ukrainian leader suggesting Trump had failed to grasp the moral hazard of dealing with the war's aggressor.\nZelensky's message cut to the heart of what critics say is Trump's fundamental miscalculation in dealing with Russia. That by ending Moscow's isolation and seeking a quick ceasefire he risks emboldening Putin, weakening Europe and leaving Ukraine open to being devoured.\nTrump tends to characterise the war as a kind of binary conflict between two sides who should both take their share of burden or blame for the fighting and its causes.\nBut Zelensky was trying to warn of catastrophic consequences of this thinking. This was the Ukrainian leader directly telling Trump in the Oval Office: Appease Russia, and the war will come to you.\nIt triggered Trump's biggest backlash. \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel. You're in no position to dictate that,\" he said, his voice getting louder.\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" he told him. \"You're gambling with millions of lives.\"\nThis exchange may win Zelensky plaudits among those who wanted to see him to stand up to Trump; but this moment could also decide an era of war and peace in Europe.\nAt one point later in the conversation, Zelensky said: \"From the very beginning of the war, we have been alone and we are thankful.\"\nThis angered Trump, who has repeatedly framed the war as a drain on American taxpayers.\n\"You haven't been alone,\" he said. \"You haven't been alone. We gave you - through this stupid president - $350bn,\" Trump said, a reference to Biden.\nVance then asked whether Zelensky had thanked the US during the meeting and accused him of campaigning \"for the opposition\" - the Democrats - during the US election last year.\nThe comment was a reference to a visit Zelensky made to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania - Joe Biden's hometown - just weeks before Americans headed to the polls in the November election.\nRepublicans were outraged at the visit, accusing Zelensky of turning the tour into a partisan campaign event on Kamala Harris's behalf in a battleground state.\nHere was all the bitter division of America's own polarised internal politics pouring into the room at a critical moment for future of global security.\n\"Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war,\" Zelensky began saying, only for Trump to cut him off.\n\"He's not speaking loudly,\" Trump shot back, visibly irritated. \"Your country's in big trouble.\"\n\"You're not winning, you're not winning this,\" Trump said. \"You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.\"\n\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" said Trump. \"It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change.\"\nThe president and vice-president reprimanded Zelensky, appearing most angered by what they perceived as his \"attitude\". \n\"Just say thank you,\" Vance demanded at one point.\nZelensky's responses - which were to fact check the two far more powerful men and argue his corner - seemed driven by the existential nature of this moment. \nHe has spent three years defending his country from invasion, while also trying to hold together a society and its political leadership that Putin has tried to drive apart. \nBut out of the main camera shot was another sight in the room. Zelensky's  ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, who was spotted with her head in her hands as the arguments escalated. \nIt is an image that sums up the diplomatic position for Zelensky and his relationship with - until now at least - his superpower sponsor in trying to repel Russia. \nStanding up to Trump like he did on Friday could, ultimately, mean losing to Putin.",

        "article_text": "US investigators are trying to establish how Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, died after the discovery of their bodies at their home in the US state of New Mexico.\nOfficials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February - 10 days before the couples' bodies were found. \nHere is what we know so far about the death of a Hollywood legend known for such films as The French Connection and The Conversation.\nWarning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting\n \nThe bodies of the couple and one of their dogs were found by police on Wednesday at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a maintenance worker called emergency services.\nIn a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.\nHackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park.\nThe couple appeared to have been \"dead for quite a while\", said Sheriff Adan Mendoza.\nArakawa's body showed signs of \"decomposition\", and \"mummification\" in the hands and feet, a sheriff's detective said.\nHackman's remains \"showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent\" with those on his spouse.\nA German Shepherd dog owned by the couple was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Arakawa.\nNo cause was given in police statements immediately after the announcement of the deaths.\nThe authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths \"suspicious enough\" to investigate and did not rule out foul play.\nA carbon monoxide poisoning test came out negative for both Arakawa and Hackman, the Santa Fe Sheriff's office said on Friday.\nNear Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she had abruptly fallen to the ground.\nAn autopsy and toxicology tests have been requested for both Hackman and Arakawa. Authorities said it could be a few months before the results of those are released.\nThe local utility company found no sign of a gas leak in the area and the fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.\nA prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body.

        "article_text": "Stargazers will be treated to a rare alignment of seven planets on 28 February when Mercury joins six other planets that are already visible in the night sky. Here's why it matters to scientists.\nPeer up at the sky on a clear night at the end of February and you could be in for a treat. Through out January and February six planets \u2013 Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 have been visible in the night sky. During just one night \u2013 28 February \u2013 they will be joined by Mercury, a rare seven-planet alignment visible in the sky. It is a spectacle that will not be visible again until 2040.\nBut such events are not just a treat for stargazers \u2013 they can also have a real impact on our Solar System and offer the opportunity to gain new insights about our place within it.\nThe eight major planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun in the same flat plane, and all at different speeds. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, completes an orbit \u2013 a year for the planet \u2013 in 88 days. Earth's year, of course, is 365 days, while at the upper end, Neptune takes a whopping 60,190 days, or about 165 Earth years, to complete a single revolution of our star.\nThe different speeds of the planets mean that, on occasion, several of them can be roughly lined up on the same side of the Sun. From Earth, if the orbits line up just right, we can see multiple planets in our night sky at the same time. In rare events, all the planets will line up such that they all appear in our night sky together along the ecliptic, the path traced by the Sun.\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are all bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, while Uranus and Neptune require binoculars or a telescope to spot.\nIn January and February 2025, it has been possible to witness this event taking place. The planets are not exactly lined up, so they appear in an arc across the sky due to their orbital plane in the Solar System. During clear nights, all of the planets except Mercury should be visible \u2013 an event sometimes called a planetary parade. On 28 February, though \u2013 weather permitting \u2013 all seven planets will be visible, a great spectacle for observers on the ground.\n\"There is something special about looking at the planets with your own eyes,\" says Jenifer Millard, a science communicator and astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in the UK. \"Yes, you can go on Google and get a more spectacular view of all these planets. But when you're looking at these objects, these are photons that have travelled millions or billions of miles through space to hit your retinas.\"\nWhile fascinating to observe, do such alignments have any impact here on Earth? Or might they have a use for increasing our understanding of our Solar System and beyond?\nIn fact, says Millard, \"it's just happenstance that they happen to be in this position of their orbits\". And while there have been suggestions from some scientists that planetary alignments might cause impacts on Earth, the scientific basis for most of these claims is weak or non-existent.\nIn 2019, however, researchers suggested that planetary alignments could have an impact on solar activity. One of the main outstanding questions about the Sun is what drives its 11-year cycle between periods of peak activity, known as solar maximum (which we are currently in), and periods of weakest activity, solar minimum. Frank Stefani, a physicist at Helmholtz-Zentrum research centre in Dresden-Rossendorf in Germany, believes the combined tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter could be the answer.\nWhile the tidal pull of each planet on the Sun is extremely small, Stefani says that when two or more of the planets line up with the Sun \u2013 known as a syzygy \u2013 they might combine to cause small rotations inside the star, called Rossby waves, which can drive weather events.\n\"On Earth, Rossby waves cause cyclones and anticyclones,\" says Stefani. \"We have the same Rossby waves in the Sun.\" Stefani's calculations showed that the alignments of Venus, Earth and Jupiter would cause a periodicity to solar activity of 11.07 years, almost exactly matching the length of solar cycles that we see.\nNot everyone is so sure about the idea, with some noting that solar activity can already be explained by processes within the Sun alone. \"The observational evidence suggests that the planets directly causing the solar cycle just doesn't happen,\" says Robert Cameron, a solar scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System research in Germany, who published a paper on the subject in 2022. \"There's no evidence of any synchronisation.\"\nBut there are other, far less contentious, quirks of planetary alignments which certainly do have an impact on us: their usefulness for scientific observations, particularly in terms of exploring the Solar System.\nReaching the outer planets with a spacecraft is difficult because these worlds are so far away, billions of miles, and would take decades to reach. However, using the gravitational pull of a well-placed planet, such as Jupiter, to slingshot a spacecraft outwards can reduce the travel time dramatically, something no spacecraft has done better than Nasa's Voyager vehicles.\nIn 1966, a Nasa scientist called Gary Flandro calculated that there would be an alignment of the four outermost planets \u2013 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 in 1977 that would enable all four to be visited within a span of just 12 years, compared to 30 years if they were not aligned. This fortuitous alignment, which occurs only once every 175 years, led to Nasa launching the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1977 on a \"Grand Tour\" of the outer Solar System.\nVoyager 1 flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, eschewing Uranus and Neptune because scientists wanted to fly past Titan, Saturn's fascinating moon, and could not do so without ruining the slingshot effect.\nBut Voyager 2 used the alignment to visit all four planets, becoming the only spacecraft in history to visit Uranus and Neptune, in 1986 and 1989 respectively.\n\"That worked out fantastic,\" says Fran Bagenal, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the US and a member of the Voyager science team. \"If Voyager 2 had left in 1980, it would have taken until 2010 to get to Neptune. I don't think it would have won support. Who's going to fund such a thing?\"\nIt is not just within our Solar System that planet alignments are useful. Astronomers use alignments to probe many different aspects of the Universe, and none more so than in the discovery and study of exoplanets, worlds that orbit stars other than the Sun.\nThe dominant way of finding such worlds is known as the transit method: when an exoplanet passes in front of a star from our point of view it dims the star's light, allowing its size and orbit to be discerned.\nThanks to this method, we have discovered many planets in orbit around certain stars. Trappist-1, a red dwarf star located 40 light-years from Earth, has seven Earth-sized planets that all transit the star from our point of view. The planets in that system are actually in resonance with each other \u2013 meaning the outermost planet completes two orbits for every three orbits of the next planet inwards, then four, six, and so on. This means there are periods where multiple planets in the system align in a straight line, something that doesn't happen in our Solar System.\nUsing transits, we can study the existence of atmospheres on planets like these. \"If a planet with an atmosphere goes in front of a star, that alignment means the starlight goes through the planet, and the molecules and atoms in the planet's atmosphere absorb light at certain wavelengths,\" says Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the Nasa Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology.\nThis allows different gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen to be identified. \"The vast majority of our atmospheric composition analysis is due to alignments,\" she says.\nMuch grander alignments can let us probe the distant Universe, namely the alignments of galaxies. Observing galaxies in the very early universe is difficult because they are so faint and far away. However, if a large galaxy or cluster of galaxies passes between our line of sight with a much more distant early galaxy, its large gravitational pull can magnify the light of the more distant object, allowing us to observe and study it, a process called gravitational lensing.\n\"These are huge alignments across the scale of the universe,\" says Christiansen. They are used by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope to observe remote stars and galaxies such as Earendel, the most distant known star from Earth. The light viewed by the telescope from the star came from the first billion years of the 13.7-billion-year-history of the Universe and was visible only because of gravitational lensing.\nAnd then there are some more novel uses of alignments, such as probing the existence of extraterrestrial life, in solar systems where the exoplanets pass in front of each other from our point of view.\nIn 2024, graduate student Nick Tusay at Pennsylvania State University in the US used these alignments to\u00a0look for any spillover communications\u00a0being sent between worlds of the Trappist-1 system, such as how on Earth we send signals to planets like Mars in our solar system to talk to rovers and spacecraft. \"Any time that two planets are aligned might be interesting,\" says Tusay.\nOn this occasion the searches turned up short. But an alien civilisation looking towards our own Solar System might use similar alignments for the same purpose. While the planetary parade this month depends on your point of view \u2013 any two planets in our system can be aligned if you are positioned at the right angle \u2013 it's not impossible to imagine someone else on the other end, watching on.\n\"Perhaps another alien civilisation might see this as an opportunity to conduct their own investigations,\" says Tusay.\n* This article was originally published on 19 January 2025.

        "article_text": "US Supreme Court justices indicated during a hearing on Wednesday that they would side with a woman who alleged she was discriminated against at her job because she is heterosexual.\nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years. \nShe claims she was passed over for a promotion, then demoted, because she is straight. The job she hoped to get and the one she held when demoted, were both given to gay colleagues, according to the lawsuit.\nOhio state officials have denied the discrimination, and Ms Ames has so far been unsuccessful in court.\nIn oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court - split 6-3 in favour of conservative judges - justices on both sides ideologically appeared sympathetic to Ms Ames's case.\nA 1964 US law forbids discrimination in the workplace, and in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that protection extends to sexual orientation, however lower courts have dismissed Ms Ames's case.\nUS court precedent covering some states, including Ohio, requires that members of majority groups - such as white people or heterosexuals - show a higher level of evidence when making discrimination claims.\nPlaintiffs in those cases \u2013 sometimes called \"reverse discrimination\" \u2013 are required to show additional \"background circumstances\" to prove their case, for instance evidence that LGBTQ people made decisions affecting the person discriminated against, or evidence showing a pattern of discrimination.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ms Ames had positive performance evaluations, but in 2019 she and two other heterosexual employees were passed over for a promotion that was eventually given to a lesbian.\nShe was later demoted, according to the lawsuit, and her job was given to a gay man.\nIn addition to ruling that Ms Ames did not show a pattern of discrimination or \"background circumstances\", a lower court also previously found that managers at the youth services department had \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for their decisions.\nDuring arguments on Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of the court's conservative members, said: \"Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether you are gay or straight, is prohibited. The rules are the same whichever way it goes.\"\nAccording to the transcript of the hearing, another conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, said that \"it doesn't matter if she was gay or whether she was straight\", the legal burden should be the same.\nAnd several of the court's liberal justices seemed to agree.

        "article_text": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant.\u00a0Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare.\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right \u2013 she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\u00a0\nThe playwright\u00a0never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\u00a0\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\u00a0\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady\n\u2022\u00a0The historic female gang who menaced London\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her\u00a02011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s\u00a0that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\u00a0\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest.\u00a0\"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\u00a0\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" \u2013 one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\u00a0\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The fact the FA Cup is the only thing they can win doesn't help much either.

You've even got some Plymouth fans saying they would rather stay up than win it this season - my response to that is 'are you clinically insane? Who cares if we stay up!'.\n\"In a few years you are not going to say 'oh thank God we are in the Championship. You are going to go 'can you remember when we won the FA Cup!?!' That's what you dream about.\n\"Those one-off events are the things you cling on to, and in a strange way I am glad that because I wasn't able to go to our win over Liverpool, I was at Strictly Live with my daughter instead.\n\"That makes it more of a memory for me.

I'm sure Unai Emery would ideally like to keep his finger in every pie, but we've seen how that has stretched his squad already.\nStill, this is where you want to be as a Villa fan, with your team fighting on all fronts near the end of the season - and they will be favourites for this tie even if Emery rests players.\nLet's face it, Cardiff are pretty hopeless, especially on the road where they have only won one Championship game all season.\nCardiff have won away twice in the FA Cup, against Sheffield United and Stoke City, but it was basically the Blades reserves who they beat in round three.\nThey may rest players too - it depends whether they prioritise this tie or their relegation fight and Tuesday's league game at home to Burnley - but, even if they don't make changes, Villa will probably be too strong for them, especially at home.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nJosh's prediction: Villa are still in the Champions League but they still seem to me to be a team for the FA Cup this year, because they are not going to win anything else, realistically. \nSo, there is quite a lot in this for them while, in contrast, if any of the Championship teams are going to be focused on the league it is Cardiff. 3-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup moment: It would probably be Wrexham beating Arsenal in 1992 with Mickey Thomas's free-kick for their equaliser. I don't like Wrexham now because they are the big dogs of the lower leagues but that was the iconic upset of my childhood.\nIt was probably the first big one that I saw for myself. When I was a kid, all the same FA Cup upsets used to get talked about all the time - like Hereford against Newcastle - but this was the first proper one I remember, after Arsenal had won the league and Wrexham had finished bottom.\nThis video can not be played\nFA Cup Archive: Wrexham upset Arsenal in 1992\nSelhurst Park, 12:15 GMT\n12th in Premier League v 12th in Championship\nGap = 8\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWill in-form Crystal Palace go for it in the FA Cup? I really hope so.\nOliver Glasner's side have improved as the season has gone on and they are comfortably in mid-table of the Premier League without any danger of going down. A cup run would really cap this as a successful campaign for him.\nIt would have an even bigger impact for Palace's fans. I still remember Ian Wright's goals in the 1990 final where they lost to Manchester United in a replay. They lost to United in the 2016 final too, and it would be great to give them a new memory.\nThis won't be easy, because former Norwich boss Alex Neil took charge of Millwall at the end of last year and is doing a good job.\nThey have been quite stubborn in recent weeks and I'm expecting more of the same here, but the Eagles should edge it in normal time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: We beat Millwall 5-1 off the back of of our win over Liverpool, which was a bit of a freak result. Normally you'd lose straight after that kind of game. \nLike Villa, Palace are another team who should be going for the FA Cup but Millwall have reached the final in my lifetime, even if it was fully 21 years ago. \nI'd gone for a replay at first, before I remembered there aren't any - the death of FA Cup replays is very sad, isn't it? 1-1 after extra time, then Millwall to win on penalties\nDeepdale, 12:15 GMT\n15th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\nGap = 12\nWatch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nThis will be 0-0 after 90 minutes, 0-0 after extra time and 0-0 after the first five penalties by each team in the shootout.\nIt ended 0-0 when they played each other in the league a couple of weeks ago and I'd be shocked if we see anything different this time, bearing in mind how both teams are set up.\nMaybe they should just play a kind of 'golden goal' from the start on Saturday where the first team to score, wins?\nBurnley have kept 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship and their defensive record is incredible but I suppose it might open things up a bit if their manager Scott Parker has one eye on automatic promotion and makes changes before they go to Cardiff on Tuesday.\nPreston boss Paul Heckingbottom probably has more scope to go for it, but his side are not exactly prolific so there are not going to be many goals here.\nLet's be honest, this is unlikely to be a thriller.\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Burnley to win 1-0 on penalties\nJosh's prediction: Preston are perennially fine in the Championship - I can't remember the last time they changed division and they must be quite a boring club to support. \nBurnley in contrast are one of the six teams that are forever going to switch between the Premier League and the Championship. They are trying to win promotion this time by not conceding any goals whatsoever, which is different, but still not very exciting for their fans. \nThis is a local derby, but it is such a dry game. I'll go 1-0 to Burnley - no, 1-0 to Preston. 1-0\nVitality Stadium, 15:00 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 17th in Premier League\nGap = 10\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nWolves won here in the Premier League on Saturday but only after Bournemouth had Illia Zabarnyi sent off in the first half. That completely skewed that result so I am not using it as a form guide for this tie.\nWhat will be more relevant is how many changes both teams make for this game. \nI was at Wolves' win over Blackburn in round four and their manager Vitor Pereira went kind of half-strong there. I can guarantee you he will be prioritising Premier League survival ahead of FA Cup progress, so we will probably see another mix-and-match selection from him here too.\nAs for Bournemouth, well I have already talked about why Crystal Palace should be trying to win the FA Cup this season, and the same definitely applies to Andoni Iraola's side.\nThe Cherries have only reached the quarter-finals twice before, losing at that stage in 1957 and 2021, and their best moments in the competition are probably as a lower-league giantkiller, such as when they beat Manchester United as a third-tier team in 1984.\nThis year they are genuine contenders to win it and lift the club's first major trophy, and they have already shown they can beat anyone, especially at home. \nThey are still seventh in the Premier League despite losing their past two matches, and I would be really disappointed - no, actually I'd be angry - if Iraola picks a weakened team in the situation they are in.\nHe has got a responsibility to the fans to try to reach the semi-finals for the first time. Yes they have got a chance of making the Champions League, which would be incredible, but they are only two wins away from their biggest day out ever at Wembley. Why not go for it?\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nJosh's prediction: Usually, the result never recurs when teams play each other twice in a short space of time, so I am backing Bournemouth. 2-0\nEtihad Stadium, 17:45 GMT\n4th in Premier League v 22nd in Championship\nGap = 38\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe FA Cup is Manchester City's only realistic chance of a trophy this season, so there is no chance they will lack focus here.\nCity come into this tie off the back of a good win at Tottenham on Wednesday, which I predicted. The readers went for a Spurs victory, which was just ridiculous - what on earth were you thinking?\nI am going for Pep Guardiola's side to win this comfortably, but fair play to Plymouth for getting this far.\nThey have knocked out Liverpool and won at Brentford but it is going to be third time unlucky for them against Premier League teams.\nWith what is at stake for them, City cannot let this one slip - and they won't.\nSutton's prediction: 5-0\nJosh's prediction: I think it is absurd when fans predict victories for their own team. They do it all the time, while I just go into every game thinking we are going to lose - that is my attitude to life, that surely this is going to go wrong.\nSo, I think we are going to lose every game 4-0, which actually feels like a worthwhile prediction here. Then you are always pleasantly surprised - well, maybe not always, but most of the time - when you don't. \nWe have played very, kind of, pretty football for the past five years but under our new manager, our playing style is, shall we say, a little more industrial these days.\nIt's much worse when you are at home trying to break down a team in the Championship but it is perfect for this scenario, away at Manchester City. We are practising the right type of football to cause an FA Cup upset but the truth of it is that we are not going to win, so who cares!? 4-0\nJosh on who will win the FA Cup? I obviously want Plymouth to win it but I think City will do it. So, in a way, this is one of those games where people say 'this is the real final'. Whoever wins out of Plymouth and City will go on and win the FA Cup.\nSt James' Park, 13:45 GMT\n6th in Premier League v 8th in Premier League\nGap = 2\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nAlexander Isak missed Newcastle's defeat at Anfield with a groin injury so he has to be a doubt for this tie too, and his absence is a massive blow for Eddie Howe's side.\nBrighton have hit a bit of form since losing 7-0 to Nottingham Forest at the start of February, and have won four in a row in the Premier League and FA Cup.\nThe Seagulls also won at St James' Park earlier in the season, when Danny Welbeck got the winner. I remember that one because I got that prediction wrong.\nPeople are talking about Newcastle being distracted by their upcoming Carabao Cup final against Liverpool [on 16 March] but could they actually be in line for a domestic cup double this season?\nI am banking on them keeping that possibility alive here. They obviously could really do with having Isak back but, even if he is not fit, then surely Brighton can't win there twice this season... can they?\nSutton's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Newcastle are never going to win the FA Cup - they are always constantly about to win the FA Cup, and about to win their first trophy. I mean obviously they have got the Carabao Cup final coming up but, no, Newcastle will never win the FA Cup. Brighton are quite a 1980s team, aren't they, because of when they reached the Cup final in 1983? Let's see that again. 1-2\nOld Trafford, 16:30 GMT\n14th in Premier League v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. \nI am sick of backing Manchester United. Even though they beat Ipswich on Wednesday, they did not half make hard work of it and the Tractor Boys ran them close at Old Trafford.\nAlejandro Garnacho appeared to have a bit of a hissy fit after being hooked before half-time, so it will be interesting to see how Ruben Amorim deals with that. He won't have any players left at this rate if he decides to leave Garnacho out.\nUnited are the FA Cup holders and they have beaten Fulham home and away already this season but on both occasions it was far from convincing, and I don't really care about that anyway.\nAmorim is a likeable guy, and I've got sympathy for him about the size of his task at Old Trafford but, from watching United, I cannot think of any reason to back them to win this. \nI am usually wrong about Fulham, but they are going to take this one - 100%.\nSutton's prediction: 0-3\nJosh's prediction: I can see United getting to the cup final this year. They were quite jammy on their way to winning it last year - against Coventry in the semi-final for example - but were they actually jammy? It meant they kept Erik ten Hag for another six months which is probably the worst thing which could have happened to them. I don't know if that FA Cup win has made this season much worse. 2-0\nCity Ground, 19:30 GMT\n3rd in Premier League v 18th in Premier League\nGap = 15\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna made 11 changes when his side beat Coventry in round four and I suspect he will do something similar here.\nYou might have heard about 'Sutton's Super Computer', which were the calculations I did for the Monday Night Club this week, where I worked out the results of all the remaining Premier League fixtures.\nAccording to my secret formula, which is obviously extremely scientific, the Tractor Boys only have an outside chance of staying up. Along with Leicester they were in my 'no-hopers' category.\nMaybe Ipswich can surprise me and go on an FA Cup run, but you have to fancy Nottingham Forest here.\nDefeat would just leave a grim fight against relegation for McKenna's side, so I feel for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who regular readers will know follows the Tractor Boys, but not so much for my 5 Live colleague Ali Bruce-Ball who is a phony Ipswich supporter - when I asked him, he could not remember the last time he went to watch them as a fan.\nOne thing I really can't stand are people like Bruce who attach themselves to a club which has a bit of success, claiming some tenuous link from the past.\nMy boyhood team Forest may make changes too because they are still in a good position for a Champions League spot, but I am backing Chris Wood to come off the bench and get us a winner.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\nJosh's prediction: Forest are another throwback team who do not seem to have had a decent Cup run for a long time. 2-0\nJosh's favourite FA Cup final of the 1990s: Spurs versus Forest in 1991 was a really important and seismic one, because of Gazza [Paul Gascoigne] and what it did to his career. \nThere were some other great ones too, though, like 1997 when Middlesbrough lost to Chelsea. That was quite fun because of Roberto di Matteo's goal after 47 seconds. \nThen there was 1995 when Manchester United lost to Everton after they had been going for the Double and lost everything, and even 1993 was interesting because Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday met in both domestic cup finals. I'm not going to, but you could write a book about the history of 90s football based around those finals, because they mattered so much then.\nChris has six correct results from the nine midweek Premier League games played so far in week 27, with one exact score, giving him 90 points.\nWith one game still to be played, he is level with his guest, singer Paige Cavell, who also has six correct results with one exact score.\nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, the BBC readers got three correct results with no exact scores, giving them 30 points.\nThey can no longer win this week, but the outcome of Thursday's game between West Ham and Leicester will decide whether Chris or Paige takes the victory.\nChris has gone for a 2-0 Hammers success while Paige has picked a 1-1 draw.",

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases.\n*Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US).\n** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

Just below, snow-dusted peaks rise towards the heavens and the clear, glacial-blue waters of Lac Beauvert blend into the inky darkness.\nSymphony Under the Stars is one of many events at the annual Dark Sky Festival (17 October to 2 November 2025) held in Jasper National Park, one of the world's largest and most accessible dark sky preserves.\u00a0\nDesignated as a Dark Sky Preserve in 2011 by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) and spanning 11,000 sq km of protected land where minimal to no light pollution is allowed, Jasper isn't just one of the best places to stargaze; it's also an ideal spot to see the Northern Lights.\u00a0And as experts predict that 2025 \"will mesmerise\" with one of the greatest aurora displays in 20 years, there's never been a better time to explore this quiet corner of the Canadian Rockies.\nUnlike other Dark Sky Preserves in Canada and the US like Wood Buffalo National Park and Grasslands National Park that have little to no infrastructure or lodging, the eponymous 4,700-person town of Jasper \u2013 located within the preserve \u2013 allows travellers easy stargazing access. According to Tyler Burgardt, an astrophysicist and general manager of the Jasper Planetarium, what makes Jasper so unique is visitors can drive right in. Located roughly 3.5 hours from Edmonton and Calgary, the town's hotels and locally led stargazing tours means star-lovers don't need to rough it.\n\"You get to see something you don't get in other [accessible] places, which is the ability to see thousands of stars, even from the middle of town,\" Burgardt said.\nHis favourite tour is one offered in summer, where guests visit the planetarium and then take a twilight stroll down to a peninsula located on Lac Beauvert. Ringed by rugged peaks and hauntingly silent, the only sound you may hear is the soft ripple of wind on the water. Burgardt estimates the Northern Lights are visible here roughly every 10 days to two weeks. \"It's just absolutely beautiful,\" he said. \"It's a really cool way to truly experience the nighttime side of the Canadian Rockies.\"\nThe quaint, alpine community is committed to ensuring that minimal artificial lighting is visible by installing streetlights that point downwards and have a softer glow than regular lights. As Burgardt notes, Jasper's location within the national park, and surrounded by the Unesco-designated Canadian Rocky Mountains, also provides a natural barrier from the artificial light created by nearby cities.\nAccording to the RASC, the goal of a dark sky designation in a community is to promote \"low-impact lighting practices, to improve the nocturnal environment for plants and wildlife, to protect and expand dark observing sites for astronomy and to provide accessible locations for naturalists and the general public to experience the naturally dark night sky\".\nPhillipa Gunn, public relations and communications officer for Parks Canada, said Jasper National Park initially met some of the requirements from the RASC needed to become a Dark Sky Preserve prior to its official designation, including accessible observation sites where visitors can view the sky.\n\"Jasper National Park is an ideal location for a Dark Sky Preserve as 97% of the park is a designated wilderness area, free of light pollution,\" Gunn said. Parks Canada has also continued to expand its dark sky interpretation programmes, while working with the town and private partners to ensure all the street fixtures in the townsite are dark-sky compliant. As a result, when driving to Jasper at night, it's nearly impossible to tell a town is even located in the vast blackness that envelopes the area.\u00a0\nIn July 2024, a series of devastating fires ripped through Jasper, causing the \"jewel of the Rockies\" to close for several months. The park reopened last autumn in time for the Jasper Dark Sky Festival \u2013 albeit just on a smaller scale. But with 2025 marking the festival's 15th anniversary, Naji Khouri, director of destination development for Tourism Jasper, says this year's festival will be bigger than ever before. Plans include a drone show where 200 synchronised drones put on a light display, notable guest speakers (Bill Nye has previously attended), planetarium stargazing sessions and a portable telescope and tent at the base of the Jasper Sky Tram.\n\"We invite space or science enthusiasts, aurora chasers and anyone that is fascinated by the dark sky and wants to learn more about it. We have unique experiences that are really of interest to a wide range of people, including families,\" said Khouri. And locals want people to know that Jasper isn't only open for the Dark Sky Festival, but for business as usual, with more than 80% of local businesses back open since the blaze.\nAfter hiking the Sulphur Skyline trail to experience sweeping views of the Fiddle River Valley and Utopia Mountain, paddling on the \"pearl necklace\" that is Maligne Lake or exploring the Pyramid Lake Overlook by day, visitors should also seek out stories of the stars from an Indigenous and cultural lens.\u00a0\nThe Indigenous people of Canada have long utilised the night sky in all aspects of daily life: the\u00a0stars\u00a0and constellations served as guiding lights for their ancestors and the sky was used as both a clock and calendar, indicating when to plant, hunt and work the land. The\u00a0stars\u00a0are also intrinsically linked to First Nations' spiritual identities and are connected to the legends of the past.\u00a0\nMatricia Bauer of Warrior Women, an Indigenous- and women-owned business run by Bauer and her daughter, offers a fireside stargazing tour in Jasper that is based around Indigenous creation stories. Being of Cree descent, Bauer recognised the importance of decolonising her own education and that included learning about the Cree Star Chart and the Indigenous constellations that came to rest in the kisik (sky), in Cree.\n\"[The Cree Star Chart] made sense of the world around me, it made sense of the Northern Lights,\" she said. \"I understood who Star Woman was. I understood why we come from the stars and why we return to the stars.\"\nIn Cree culture, there are different Star Beings, and Star Woman is one of them. According to Bauer, Star Woman saw the Earth \u2013 where humans lived \u2013 and she gave up her Star Being to come to \"Turtle Island\" (North America) . When she became pregnant with twins, this was the start of the First People. At the end of her life, she was granted three wishes and one of the wishes was that she could return to the sky.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Indigenous tribes reclaiming travel\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The last places on Earth to see truly dark starry nights\n\"And so, when we see the Northern Lights, we call that the Cipayuk,\" said Bauer. \"It means ancestors dancing, or ghosts dancing. It's reminding us that there is another realm that exists, that we get to stay in for the rest of our lives. It's when we go back to the Star World where we came from.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nAs Bauer recants stories with songs, she also tells me about Spider Woman, the one who is weaving our fates in the dark sky that soars above us. She then recounts the story of the coyote, tricking the wolves and bears into the sky so that he could create his own constellation. A story that takes place in winter, to be told in winter, when the days are short, the nights are long and the fire becomes a place to gather.\u00a0\nTo Bauer and many First Nations residents in and around Jasper, the stars, also known as achakosak, are considered relatives: \"Every constellation, every star has a beautiful song, has a beautiful story, has a beautiful place in our culture.\"\nThere are many more stories that Bauer wants to tell for visitors, and many more conversations to still be had under the black cloak of Jasper's night sky. The snap, crackle and pop of the fire is an accompanying beat to the drum that she plays, and her voice dances towards the place where she knows she will one day return.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Support for Ukraine has become a key issue since Donald Trump returned to the White House.\nPresident Trump has made a number of claims about how much the United States has spent compared to European countries.\nBut some of his claims are questionable - with no evidence to back them up.\nPresident Trump has made this claim on a number of occasions - including when he hosted France's President Macron in the White House this week.\nShort answer: Figures suggest the actual spend is much lower.\nBBC Verify can find no evidence to back up the claim.  There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim. So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.\nPresident Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"\nShort answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.\nThe United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.\nHowever, again, there are different figures out there.\nThe European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans. Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.Has the United States spent $200bn more than Europe?President Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"Short answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.The United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.The figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.However, again, there are different figures out there.The European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans.",

        "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources, Trump has said. \nZelensky has described the bilateral deal as preliminary, and said he wants further agreements which include US security guarantees to deter renewed Russian aggression. \nBut Trump said the US would not provide guarantees \"beyond... very much\", saying the responsibility should instead fall to Europe.\nTrump also seemingly ruled out the prospect of Ukraine becoming a Nato member - one of Zelensky's long-held ambitions. \nSpeaking at a meeting of his cabinet on Wednesday, Trump said the presence of American workers extracting rare earth metals on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\" for Ukraine. \nHe said Kyiv should \"forget about\" joining Nato and repeated Russia's claims that the issue was one of the driving factors behind the war. \nThe US president suggested a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia was not far off, telling reporters: \"We're going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people.\"\nBut Zelensky said without security guarantees \"we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing\". \n\"I want to find a Nato path or something similar,\" he said.\n\nRussia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.\nIn 2008, the alliance had said that Ukraine could eventually join.\nTrump has suggested European peacekeeping troops could be stationed in Ukraine as part of a ceasefire deal, but Russia says it is against this. \nEuropean representatives, however, were not included in Washington's initial talks with Russia.\nSpeaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said \"for any kind of deal to work on European soil, you need the Europeans to also agree to it\".\nShe said the mineral resources deal was up to Ukraine, but any peace agreement would \"need the Europeans on board\".\nMs Kallas' scheduled meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday was abruptly cancelled, with both sides citing scheduling issues.\nZelensky said the success of the minerals deal, which was formally backed by his government on Wednesday evening, would depend on the outcome of his meeting with Trump this week.\nKey details have not yet been made public, but Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said it envisages an \"investment fund\" for Ukraine's reconstruction.\nThe prospect of a deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nBut disagreements over its substance exacerbated tensions between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks. \nThe Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports suggest this demand has now been dropped.\nThere are also differences in how both sides are now describing the deal. Trump has lauded the \"very big agreement\" as an opportunity for the US to get its \"money back\" after funding aid to Ukraine. \nBut Zelensky has instead referred to it as a \"framework agreement\" upon which he hopes further deals can be made.\nTrump has said he wants a quick end to the war in Ukraine and has sought to reset relations with Russia. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two leaders sent delegations to Saudi Arabia in bilateral talks which excluded Ukraine. \nIn response, Zelensky accused the US of helping Putin \"break out of years of isolation\" and Trump of living in a \"Russian disinformation space\". \nUkraine is a country rich in natural resources. Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are there. But accessing some of these resources will not be completely straightforward. \nSome of the mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that Ukraine first needs to addresses its problem with unexploded mines before striking a deal with the US.\nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nPutin has also said he is open to offering the US access to rare minerals, including from Russian-occupied Ukraine.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will also be meeting both Trump and Zelensky separately this week to discuss the war in Ukraine.\nHe is due to arrive in Washington later on Wednesday.",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go.

Cuts to national parks and forests met with backlash as summer nears45 minutes agoShareSaveMax MatzaBBC NewsReporting fromSeattle, WashingtonShareSaveGetty ImagesThe Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.The impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. Now, those jobs are gone.She worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHamilton makes first global appearance as a Ferrari driver\nLewis Hamilton made his first global appearance as a Ferrari driver as Formula 1 launched its 2025 season with a glitzy, ground-breaking show at London's O2 Arena.\nHamilton, whose first laps in a Ferrari were watched at the team's test track by a few hundred fans in Italy last month, was the star attraction during the two-hour show on Tuesday, and received the biggest cheers.\nBut many of the drivers drew huge reactions from the 15,000 crowd at the event, tickets for which sold out in 20 minutes last year.\n\"Good evening everyone,\" Hamilton said as the crowd celebrated him and their first sight of the seven-time champion in Ferrari's red overalls.\n\"Such a great night to be here among all of you. The word I am thinking about is 'invigorated'. I feel so full of life, because everything is new. Just focused on what's ahead. I am so excited to be part of the team.\"\nF1 75 launch event in pictures\nRussell has 'no intention' of speaking to Verstappen\nDriving test week 'hell' for F1 rookie Antonelli\nHost Jack Whitehall, meanwhile, joked about what it must have felt like for Mercedes to see their former champion walking out for their rivals.\nHamilton became the most successful driver in F1 history racing for the Silver Arrows. Now, he is turning out for the biggest, most celebrated, most historic name in the sport, in a partnership that has created a huge buzz already, with the season still just under a month away.\n\"It's everyone's worst nightmare,\" Whitehall said. \"Your partner of 10 years running off with an Italian stallion.\"\nHamilton, team-mate Charles Leclerc and Ferrari team boss Frederic Vasseur flew back to Italy straight after the show, to prepare for the official launch of Ferrari's 2025 car in Maranello on Wednesday. As with the other teams, the car on stage was a show car in this year's paint job, not the machine that will contest this championship.\nBut Hamilton, who has gone to Ferrari with the aim of securing a record-breaking eighth title, was far from the only driver feeling the love of the audience.\nThe most popular names were no surprise - Leclerc, Hamilton's fellow Briton Lando Norris, his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, Aston Martin's veteran legend Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz, now at Williams, and Mercedes' George Russell all raised the roof.\nLeclerc faced the biggest ribbing from comedian Whitehall, who took every opportunity to make a joke about the Monaco native's good looks.\nAnd there was a dash of irreverence. Norris even used a naughty word as a jokey insult during a good-natured exchange with Whitehall. One trusts FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, whose crusade against bad language is regarded as ill-conceived and poorly handled by most in F1, will decide not to pursue it on this occasion.\nCertainly celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, who has a commercial deal with the sport, will think so. \"If it comes out, it comes out,\" Ramsay said as he was interviewed in the VIP area about the topic. \"Let them be real.\"\nBen Sulayem would certainly be wise not to sour the good taste left by an event that appears to have been a resounding success.\nThis video can not be played\nAntonelli was 'really nervous' ahead of driving test\nIn among the well-choreographed but also genuine celebrations of a new season, though, there was one 'gulp' moment, when Christian Horner was booed loudly as he came out on stage to host during his Red Bull team's presentation.\nAnyone wondering whether that was directed at Horner personally or the team found out the answer shortly afterwards when the cheers for four-time champion Max Verstappen drowned out a few boos.\nF1 had pulled out all the stops for this event, the first of its kind. It was nominally held to mark the 75th anniversary of the World Championship, but one imagines F1 owners Liberty Media may well be pushing for a repeat after this.\nThe attendance of all 10 teams and 20 drivers was required, and while some were more willing participants than others - Verstappen, in particular, was known not to be a fan - all were on their best behaviour, during the seven hours of media build-up to the event at a next-door hotel, and during the show itself.\nRock musician Machine Gun Kelly opened the show, and Take That closed it; there were other acts during it.\nWhitehall was a warm and witty host, poking fun at the \"beef\" between George Russell and Verstappen - \"how can anyone have a beef with George?\" he said. \"He's the nicest guy in the world.\"\nThis video can not be played\nRussell: 'Me and Max won't be best mates'\nEverything went off with an almost military precision, each team using their seven-minute allocation during the evening for their own unique style of presentation.\nMany in F1 had questioned what the show was for, but on the evidence of the night, that was obvious.\nA normal pre-season is marked by a drip-feed of individual launches by the teams. Some garner more attention than others, but none attract the sort of worldwide attention this event seems to have drawn - the audience on F1's YouTube channel peaked at 1.1m concurrent viewers, and totalled 4.6m across the live broadcast.\n\"This is a new milestone, such an amazing event,\" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said.\nThe presentations were done in reverse order of last year's constructors' championship, so the last team to do their presentation were McLaren.\n\"It's a pleasure to be here tonight,\" Norris said. \"We're all excited. A lot of hard work and today it starts.\"\nThe last word spoken by a competitor on the evening went to his ultimate boss, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown. He judged it perfectly.\n\"We never stop racing,\" Brown said. \"Let's go.\"\nOscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris brought McLaren their first constructors' championship since 1998 last season\nDrivers forced to make at least two stops in Monaco",

We were not even close to scoring. \n\"In the second half we were much closer to score. At least you give yourself an opportunity.\"\nIn Leicester's favour, however, is time. \nA five-point deficit is not insurmountable and they have 11 league games left - that's 33 points to play for.\nBut their upcoming run of fixtures looks tough with their next four games being trips to Chelsea and Manchester City and home matches against Manchester United and Newcastle.\nLeicester defender Wout Faes says the players still believe they can stay up.\n\"Of course, there has to be belief,\" the Belgian said.\n\"Weekend after weekend the games count down. I don't think we have to think too much about going forward. \n\"We just have to think game by game and we have to start winning very soon because the games are counting down.\"\nThose who have watched some of their recent games, however, are not so optimistic.\nFormer Leicester midfielder Neil Lennon said on TNT Sports: \"I hate to say it about any group of players but it is really hard to make a case for them on what we have seen. \n\"West Ham didn't have to be anywhere near their best to win the game comfortably. There was zero quality, zero belief and the game just seemed to pass them by.\"\n\"I think they are gone,\" added former Chelsea forward Joe Cole. \"I think them and Southampton are gone. \n\"How do you get these players to show some kind of spark from now to the end of the season?\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "England's men have won only one of their past 11 matches across three formats\nAnd so English cricket limps to its final stop of the winter.\nKarachi, where England will exit the Champions Trophy after Saturday's game against South Africa, is known as the City of Lights. Their last visit, the completion of a 3-0 Test series win in Pakistan in 2022, was Bazball's brightest moment. Now Brendon McCullum and his men cannot shake the dark clouds.\nAdele could write an album about how miserable England's 2025 has been so far. \nThe end of 2024 wasn't much better. The women dropped themselves out of the T20 World Cup and the men were spun out in Pakistan. Heather Knight's side at least won in South Africa and Ben Stokes' men claimed an impressive win in New Zealand, then soured it with a stag-do of a performance in the final Test in Hamilton.\nSince the turn of the year it has been a shambles: the women thrashed all over Australia, the men one win from 10 in McCullum's new white-ball era. Andrew Flintoff's Lions were hammered in South Africa and Australia, and the Under-19 women were well beaten in a World Cup semi-final by India. Thank goodness Archie Vaughan's Under-19 men won their Test series against South Africa.\nIt's probably good to get a few things straight before delving into this: all of us - fans, media and pundits - want England to do well. We care. It hurts when they lose.\nIt is also fair to say I have never met an England player that is not desperate to succeed. They may occasionally forget the England team exists for everyone, not just the individuals in the dressing room, but there is an understandable element of self-preservation at play. Dreams and careers are on the line. Professional sport is cut-throat.\nWe must also be careful to not rewrite history. McCullum was a breath of fresh air to English cricket, both in terms of results and the feeling towards the men's national team. It seemed a no-brainer to put him in charge of the white-ball side, largely because any other coach would have existed in the New Zealander's shadow.\nJon Lewis did similar with the women's team, even if Bazball-lite seemed too simplistic. The draw with Australia in the home Ashes of 2023 was creditable, and probably should have been better given Australia had lost Meg Lanning.\n'McCullum's problems go far beyond Buttler's future'\nEngland need more variety than just 90mph bowlers - Vaughan\nReplacing Buttler the sensible thing to do - Agnew\nAs 2024 wore into 2025 and results became indifferent for both teams, nagging doubts became worries and have now grown into genuine concerns.\nWill Ben Stokes be fully fit again? What has happened to Issy Wong? Why was Josh Hull picked? How did Flintoff go from TV presenter to some of the most high-profile coaching gigs in the country? Why did Dan Lawrence open the batting? Why did Kate Cross captain England in Ireland when it was a golden development opportunity for a youngster? Who signed off on one frontline spinner for a Champions Trophy in Pakistan? What is going on with Shoaib Bashir's bowling? Why do England women drop so many catches? We could go on and on.\nThere are recurring themes across the England national teams. The women have been accused of not being fit enough, the men of not training enough. Both charges are probably unfair, yet the players don't help their public image. \nWe're bored with hearing the men talk about golf and the women were downright daft to be pictured on a boat party during the T20 World Cup in Dubai. These England teams are not lazy, though they can be slapdash.\nThe rhetoric is maddening, too. Many legendary leaders have successfully paired public praise with private criticism, and listening to McCullum in particular can inspire even a jobbing journalist to take on the world. But some of the utterances of the men wind up fans and opposition, while the women were borderline delusional in Australia. Lewis' Bondi to Coogee walk will live in infamy, and the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook are never far from a crass soundbite.\nNone of this matters if England teams are winning. They aren't, which means Rob Key and Clare Connor - directors of cricket of the men's and women's team respectively - have thinking to do.\nIt seems a decent bet that Connor will be looking for a new women's head coach. A review into the Ashes is still taking place and could run until the end of next month. It may be that Knight stays on as captain, partly because she remains an excellent leader and partly because England's succession planning has been awful. Whoever is in charge must get the best out of Sophie Ecclestone on and off the pitch, while a bigger question is whether England have the right structural set-up to consistently compete with the Australians.\nKey's decisions on personnel are probably more straightforward. Jos Buttler sounded like a man ready to make up his own mind on the white-ball captaincy, with Brook most likely to take over. Where it gets trickier for Key, McCullum and the new skipper is reviving the fortunes of the white-ball team in a defining year for the Test side.\nThis video can not be played\nAfghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy\nOn one hand, it is harsh to compare the current white-ball team to the class of 2019, England's greatest team led by their greatest captain Eoin Morgan.\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that a white-ball empire has crumbled on Key's watch. It is not his fault domestic 50-over cricket has been marginalised, but the treatment of David Willey, dropping of Sam Curran and Reece Topley, overlooking of Liam Dawson, obsession with pace over skill, lack of death bowlers and left-handed batters all fall at his door. How did England take the field in the Champions Trophy with as many wicketkeepers as frontline bowlers?\nWhereas there was once separation between the Test and white-ball set-ups, greater alignment runs the risk of a malaise from one format bleeding into the other. There is at least a decent break before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.\nUntil then, questions abound. Have England broken Mark Wood in a tournament he probably shouldn't have been playing in? What state is Stokes' hamstring in? Can Bashir become the spinner England need in Australia? Can Zak Crawley reach double figures? Is Test vice-captain Ollie Pope going to be dropped to make way for Jacob Bethell?\nNone of this gloom needs to be terminal. The women's game is about to get a huge boost from the new domestic structure and the men have every chance of winning their five-Test series against India. There is a wealth of young male and female talent coming through and the Ashes next winter has all the ingredients to be a classic.\nFor now, this winter cannot end quickly enough. Last rites and alarm bells will not be drowned out by good vibes.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south. \nAdditional reporting by Kevin Church.",

a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.\nJapan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.\nMonster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.\n\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.\n\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"\nOther Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.\nRyu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020. \nThe company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time. \nThis can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.\nThe Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way. \nMore recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.\nAt last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.\nMr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".\nThat includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.\n\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.\nJapan does face some of the same challenges as other developers worldwide.\nPlayer habits are changing, with PC gaming increasing in popularity, and as technology becomes more advanced making games becomes more expensive.\nMr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\". \n\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"\nThe games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.\nIt leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.\nMr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.\n\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.\n\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"\nFor an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.\n\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.\n\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany of Doge's staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later said he was operating as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation is officially defined as those working for the government for 130 days or less in a year.\nTo some supporters of this new body, Doge's outsider status - as well as its somewhat vague mandate - will increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIts mission, says Musk, is to save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn).\nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nMusk has said he wants to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", what he describes as a fourth branch of government working against Trump's agenda. Critics of his work see a simpler ideological motivation at play.\n\"They are not going to go into agencies that are doing things they like. They are going into agencies they disagree with,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Republican director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), told Reuters news agency.\nIt is unclear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates on what they say has been cut. Among its headline-making actions are:\n\nDoge enjoys broad popular support, a poll by the BBC's US partner CBS News has suggested. \nThis indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - supported its work, even if they disagreed over how much influence Musk should have personally.\nThe size of the permanent workforce currently exceeds two million and one of the largest increases was in 2023, partly due to major investment by the Biden administration in infrastructure projects.\nDavid Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, says Doge's work is needed. \n\"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they asking, whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\"\nPolitical opponents and government watchdogs accuse Doge of acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.\nCritics highlight Musk's potential conflicts of interest, given the billions in contracts his businesses hold with the US government. Trump and Musk deny that any issues will arise.\nMultiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans, and Democrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.\nSeveral times, the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records. \nThey have scored some small victories, though. A federal judge in Washington DC ruled that Doge's work can proceed while the litigation plays out.  \nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Musk said he expected to be scrutinised for his work, but insisted that Americans had voted for \"common sense\" government reform.\nBut pundits question whether he can enact his bold pledges.\nElaine Kamark, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told the BBC that efforts to streamline government spending \"can be done\", highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\nBut she labelled Musk's idea of slashing a third of government spending \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.\nWith additional reporting by Jessica Parker and Cai Pigliucci",

        "article_text": "US president Donald Trump has been invited to meet King Charles in Scotland to discuss an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.\nAn official letter from the monarch, delivered by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday, offered a meeting at either Dumfries House in Ayrshire or Balmoral Castle, a favourite retreat of the Royal Family since the days of Queen Victoria.\nKing Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, met 13 US presidents during her 70 years on the throne but only one ever stayed with her at Balmoral.\nDwight D Eisenhower, who was often affectionately known by the nickname Ike, was a five-star general who had worked closely with Princess Elizabeth's father - King George VI - during World War 2 and became a friend of the family.\nAfter the war, in1946, the general had visited Balmoral and when he became president the young Queen made her first state visit to the US, staying with Eisenhower in private quarters at the White House in 1957.\nShe enjoyed it so much she invited the president to stay with her at her favourite Scottish sanctuary.\nReports from the time describe an informal and friendly meeting during which the Queen served drop scones at a lakeside picnic.\nShe even sent the president the recipe because he had liked them so much.\nKing Charles, who was 10 years old when his mother hosted Eisenhower in 1959, has now extended a rare invitation to the current US president to meet him in Scotland.\nLike his mother, the King is seeking to play a major role in facilitating the US and UK's \"special\" diplomatic relationship.\nIn his letter to President Trump, the King suggested meeting at either Dumfries House, which he has owned since 2007, or Balmoral, which is only about 58 miles (93km) from the Trump International golf resort at Menie in Aberdeenshire.\nThe president is due to open a new course named after his mother -

The rest had died shortly after the stranding.\nTasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.\nFalse killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes. \nAuthorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.\nLocal resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.\n\"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.\"\n\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"\nThe site - about 300km from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.\n\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.\n\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"\nRough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.\n\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.\nWith conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.\n\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.\nThat grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.\nAuthorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".\nAuthorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.\nMore than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.\nAround 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.\nWhales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.\nThere are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disoriented after following fish they hunt to the shore.\nOthers believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.",

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised.

        "article_text": "The ideal poo is a 'type 3' or 'type 4' \u2013 cracked or smooth sausage \u2013 delivered once per day.\nAre you a three-times a day kind of person, or is a trip to the lavatory a more rare and special occasion? And crucially, what does your poo frequency reveal about your health? Sit down, relax, and learn about the science of poop.\u00a0\nHow often we go for a number two can vary from person to person. Every time we eat, the large intestine contracts and pushes food along the digestive tract. This automatic \"gastro-colic reflex\" results in a the release of hormones that create the urge to poo, otherwise known as a \"call to stool\". Most of us have learnt to suppress this urge, however, meaning that once a day or less has become the new norm.\n\"We all tend to be too busy to poo,\" says Martin Veysey, a gastroenterologist and general medicine physician based at Canberra Hospital in Australia.\nConventionally, it has often been claimed that one poo a day is a sign of good gut health. But in the past it wasn't known what constitutes 'normal' when it comes to bowel movements. One study even implied that anything from one bowel action every few weeks or months to 24 poos a day could be regarded as normal.\nHowever, thanks to the pioneering work of scientists like Ken Heaton, a consultant physician at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the UK, we now known better. In the late 1980s, Keaton and colleagues surveyed residents of East Bristol, asking them the rather impertinent question \u2013 how often do you poo?\u00a0\nThe results revealed a huge variety in bowel movements. Although the most common bowel habit was one poo per day, only 40% of men and 33% of women adhered to this practice. Some defecated less than once a week, others three times a day. Overall, the study concluded that \"conventionally normal bowel function is enjoyed by less than half the population and that, in this aspect of human physiology, younger women are especially disadvantaged\".\nIncidentally this wasn't the only contribution Heaton made to the science of stools. He later helped devise The Bristol Stool Form Scale, which, with its accompanying illustrations, has become a widely used practical guide to help doctors diagnose digestive problems. The scale features handy descriptions of stools varying from \"separate hard lumps, like nuts\" to \"fluffy pieces with ragged edges\".\nThe NHS and other health bodies state that having a bowel movement between three times a day and three times a week is considered normal. But normal and healthy aren't necessarily the same thing. Scientists might have solved the mystery of how often we poo, but it does nothing to answer the question how often should we poo? Increasingly, researchers are finding that a person's bowel movements are a strong indicator of their health.\nFor example, a\u00a02023 study\u00a0examined the bowel habits of 14,573 adults in the United States. The most frequent bowel habit was seven times per week (50.7% of people), and the most common poo type was \"like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft\". Researchers then tracked the participants for over five years to see if there was any relationship between stool frequency and mortality. They found that people who pooed four soft stools a week were 1.78 times more likely to die within five years than those who pooed normal stools seven times a week. Infrequent defecators were also 2.42 and 2.27 more likely to die from cancer and cardiovascular disease, respectively.\u00a0\nHow much is a good amount to poop is also a question occupying Sean Gibbons, a microbiologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, the US. In 2024, Gibbons led a study which categorised 1,400 healthy adults into four groups based on their toilet habits; constipated (one-two bowel movements per week); low-normal (three-six bowel movements per week); high-normal (one-three bowel movements per day); and diarrhoea. They then looked to see if there was any association between poo frequency and a person's gut microbiome.\u00a0\nGibbons found that frequent pooers who squeezed out one to three stools a day had a higher proportion of 'good' bacteria residing in their guts than those who visited the lavatory less often. On the flip side of the coin, Gibbons found that people who pooed less than three times a week were more likely to have toxins in their blood that have previously been implicated in conditions such as chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's.\n\"In the Goldilocks zone of pooing [the high-normal category], we saw a rise in strictly anaerobic microbes that produce chemicals called short chain fatty acids,\" says Gibbons. One of these short chained fatty acids (SFAs), butyrate, is known to lower inflammation in the body. This is important, because chronic inflammation is now thought to be the driving factor behind conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even Alzheimer's.\n\"Having higher levels of butyrate also allows you to control glucose levels in your blood better, so you have better insulin sensitivity,\" says Gibbons. \"Butyrate will also bind to cells in the gut, stimulating them to produce hormones that make you feel full,\" he says.\nGibbons believes one reason people who were constipated had higher levels of harmful toxins in their blood stream is that when a person has infrequent bowel movements, poo sticks around in their gut for long periods. This causes bacteria in the gut to eat up all of the available fibre, converting it into health-promoting SFAs. The problem, however, is that once all the fibre is gone, the bacteria start fermenting proteins instead \u2013 which releases harmful toxins into the bloodstream. These toxins are known to cause damage to organs including the kidneys and heart. One, known as phenylacetylglutamine, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, for example.\u00a0\n\"If you have chronically high levels of this metabolite in your circulation, it can promote atherosclerosis, a kind of hardening of the arteries and damage to the cardiovascular system,\" says Gibbons.\nGibbons says that even though clinical guidance states that between three stools a day to three poos a week is healthy, his study showed that even in the low-normal stool group there was a rise in toxins in the bloodstream.\u00a0\n\"It's hard to say definitively, because we don't have causal data to know whether these people went on to get sick in the future, but it does seem to be the case that, based on what we were looking at, pooping every other day to a couple of times a day is probably a better window to be healthy,\" says Gibbons.\nHowever, as ever, correlation is not causation. It is possible that people who are already less healthy in other ways might have less frequent bowel movements, although Gibbon's study tried to control for this by only selecting adults who had no reported health concerns.\nOne measure of the health of your gut is the time it takes for food to travel through your digestive system \u2013 known as gut transit time. You can easily test this at home by eating brightly-coloured foods such as sweetcorn, and then timing how long it takes to come out the other end. Generally speaking, the longer a person's gut transit time, the less often they poo, and the more likely they are to suffer constipation.\nMore like this:\nIn 2020, researchers at King's College London gave blue muffins to 863 people to measure their gut transit time. This was part of the Predict1 study \u2013 a clinical research project focused on understanding how individual variations in genetics, gut microbiome, and other factors influence how different meals affect blood sugar and fat levels in the body.\u00a0\nThe study revealed that gut transit times varied widely from person to person, ranging from under 12 hours to many days. Remarkably, the microbes found in the guts of people with short transit times \u2013 who tended to defecate more often - differed remarkably from those with longer transit times, with a short transit time associated with a healthier gut microbiome.\n\"What we found was that people who had a longer transit time tended to have more 'bad' gut bacteria, so bacteria that have previously been linked to having worse heart health and metabolic health,\" says Emily Leeming, a microbiome scientist at King's College London.\nThis finding was most pronounced for people with a gut transit time of 58 hours or more, who tended to poo less than three times a week.\nLike Gibbons, Leeming suspects that in those whose poo spends longer in the gut, microbes aren't getting a fresh meal \u2013 so they end up switching from eating fibre and carbohydrates to proteins. This then produces byproducts which are bad for your health.\nAs well as a healthier gut microbiome, Leeming's study revealed that those with shorter gut transit times benefited from having less\u00a0visceral fat \u2013 a type of fat that lies deep within the belly and surrounds abdominal organs. Visceral fat is dangerous because\u00a0it can increase your risk of many health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Finally, people with short gut transit times also displayed healthier responses to food, known as a 'postprandial response'. This means they had lower levels of sugar and lipids in their blood following a meal, lowering their risk of cardiovascular disease.\nThe finding fits with what scientists know about constipation, and its links to chronic disease. If someone is chronically constipated, then they may be at higher risk of things like bowel cancer. However, the evidence to support this is mixed \u2013 one meta-analysis, a type of study which combines the results from several others which answer the same question, found that bowel cancer was not more prevalent in constipated individuals.\n\"But we also seeing links with other parts of the body. For example, people with Parkinson's Disease can have constipation up to 20 years before they show any motor symptoms,\" says Leeming.\nVeysey, meanwhile, points to the known link between slow bowel transit and gallstones \u2013 hard deposits of bile that form in the gallbladder. \"It also raises the risk of developing polyps, pre-cancerous lesions in the bowel, which then can become cancers,\" he says.\nRather than the number of bowel movements a week \u2013 which can vary from person to person, Leeming says that the key thing to look out for is any unexplained changes in bowel habits. She also advises that it's a good idea to keep track of your regular pooping habits to get to know what's normal for you.\u00a0\n\"We should all be looking at our poo, because it's basically like a free gut health test,\" says Leeming. \"It's not just how often you go, it's also colour and the shape of your poo as well. What you're really looking for is type 3 to type 4 [on the Bristol Stool Form Scale], which is basically a sausage with cracks in it, or a smooth sausage.\"\nAs regards colour, if you see any black or red in your stools, that indicates the presence of blood. Although there could be a harmless explanation for this, it could be a sign of colorectal cancer and so it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. You should also talk to your doctor if you regularly have diarrhoea or need to go very suddenly, or if you experience a lot of cramps, bloating, and gas after eating.\nFinally, if you'd like to become more \"regular\", there's three simple things you can do. \"In our study, the people in the Goldilocks zone ate more fruits and vegetables, were more hydrated, and were more physically active,\" says Gibbons.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Was it pruning or felling? \nThe alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.\nThe chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.\nThe trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.\nBut rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. \n\"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,\" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.\nThe project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000\u20137,000 still left to be mapped.\nDespite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.\nThis is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.\nBut on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.\nThe trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.\nThe Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected \"pleasure gardens\" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. \nThe chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.\nAccording to government literature,  in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. \nEmperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.\nInterestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.   \nBut environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.\n\"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,\" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.\n\"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,\" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.\nChinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.\nGovernment projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.\nLast week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.\n\"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,\" Mr Bhat says. \n\"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.\"",

But we will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn.

But he suspended the duties before they went into effect until 4 March, to allow for talks on border security. \nOn Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect \"on schedule\". \nAt Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April.\nThat is the same day that the Commerce Department is supposed to deliver its wider recommendations for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that \"the overall is April 2\" , distinguishing between tariffs tied to concerns about drug trafficking and migration from Mexico and Canada.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all headed lower in mid-day trade, while the peso and Canadian dollar gained.

        "article_text": "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.\nThese are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.\nThen there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.\n\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.\nNorth Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.\nSince then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.\nBut after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.\nLast Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.\nAmong them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.\nBen Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.\n\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"\nDespite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"\nOn his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.\nFor now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.\nSet up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.\nJoe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.\nJoe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.\n\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"\nBut according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.\nCovid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.\nIt is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.\nLocal guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.\nEven Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"\nThe regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.\n\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.\nOne of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.\nThey knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"\nSuch conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.\nMike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"\nFor Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"\nBut tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.\n\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.\nOne conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\nBangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. \u00a0\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\u00a0\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night \u2013 daytime, office hours \u2013 we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nTip:\nIf you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes\u00a0Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui \u2013 and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns \u2013 you name it \u2013 Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite: https://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\nTip:\nNightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach \u2013 that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: https://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: @rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: https://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From Disney's Snow White to Mickey 17, these are the films to stream at home and watch in the cinema this month.\nDisney's Snow White is a live-action/ CGI remake of Walt Disney's first ever feature-length cartoon, 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but it's proven to be more controversial than the studio's other remakes. Some bigoted social-media posters objected to the casting of Rachel Zegler, an actress with Colombian heritage, as Snow White; Zegler was hit by another backlash when she described the prince in the original cartoon as a \"stalker\"; Peter Dinklage said that the portrayal of the dwarves was \"backwards\"; and Stuart Heritage in the Guardian slated the trailer as \"arguably the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\", adding that \"the design of the new dwarves feels like something that would be deliberately shown to prisoners of war to break their spirit\". On the other hand, Disney's Snow White boasts new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (La La Land, The Greatest Showman) and a screenplay co-written by Greta Gerwig (Barbie), so its modern take on a classic fairy tale could still be a gold mine, or even a diamond mine.\nReleased in cinemas internationally on 21 March\nIf you like twisty satirical chillers set in the exclusive enclaves of super-rich eccentrics (Glass Onion, Blink Twice, The Menu \u2013 you know the sort of thing), then you're in luck: A24 has two on offer this month. In Death of a Unicorn, a father and daughter (Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega) are driving through a nature reserve owned by the father's wealthy boss (Richard E Grant) when their car crashes into a unicorn. Yes, it turns out that these fairy-tale creatures are real, and so are the magical healing properties they're reputed to have. Grant's character and his family \u2013 played by Tea Leoni and Will Poulter \u2013 are keen to exploit these properties, so a team of scientists sets about slicing up the animal's body to determine whether it really can cure cancer. Meanwhile, Opus (released on 14 March in the US) features Ayo Edebiri as a young reporter invited to the compound of a reclusive rock star played by John Malkovich.\nReleased on 28 March in the US and 4 April in the UK\nTwo months on from the release of Steven Soderbergh's last film, Presence, the ever-busy director is back with Black Bag, a spy thriller written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park). Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender play a British married couple who are also suave secret agents \u2013 a combination which isn't a problem until the wife is suspected of treason and the husband has to investigate. \"I [thought] it might be interesting to make [Edward Albee's play] Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but George and Martha are in the intelligence community,\" Soderbergh told The Hollywood Reporter. \"What would that be like? So it's a very, very specific take on people who are in the intelligence business but also have complex personal, emotional lives.\" The stellar cast includes Tom Burke, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page and Marisa Abela, along with two former James Bond regulars, Pierce Brosnan and Naomie Harris.\nReleased on 14 March in cinemas internationally\nThe Alto Knights is a crime thriller about two rival Italian American mob bosses, Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, who go from being best friends to archenemies in 1950s New York. It's directed by Barry Levinson, who made Bugsy, it's scripted by Nicholas Pileggi, the co-writer of Goodfellas, and it stars none other than Robert De Niro, so a fact-based gangster film could hardly have a more promising team behind it. The most intriguing part of the project, though, is that De Niro plays both Costello and Genovese, with just enough prosthetic make-up to stop the characters looking like identical twins. Levinson's explanation for this surprising casting? \"As kids, they were very much the same,\" the director said in Empire. \"Two guys were almost one, then they suddenly not only divide, but ultimately become enemies.\" Whether or not you're convinced, you can't complain about having two De Niro performances for the price of one.\nReleased on 21 March in the UK, the US, Canada, Ireland and Spain\nFive years after Bong Joon Ho's Parasite won the Oscars for best picture, best director, best screenplay and best international feature film, the Korean writer-director is back at last with an English-language science-fiction caper. Adapted from Edward Ashton's novel, Mickey 17 stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey, a lowly labourer on a spaceship bound for an ice planet in the year 2054. He is killed on a regular basis, but he is always \"reprinted\", with his memories and personality intact. But what happens when someone makes a mistake, and two different incarnations of Mickey are alive at the same time? David Ehrlich says in IndieWire that: \"the best and most cohesive of Bong's English-language films [is] his biggest swing to date, a wry, delightful, and resoundingly sweet mega-budget space adventure that doesn't seem to be aware that it was made by a major American studio\". On the other hand, the BBC's Hugh Montgomery felt that Mickey 17 was a \"serious disappointment\".\nReleased from 6 March in cinemas internationally\nThe horrifying story of how Charles Manson brainwashed his followers to murder innocent people in 1969 has been told in many dramas and documentaries: Quentin Tarantino even included it in Once Upon a Time\u2026 In Hollywood. But Chaos, a book by Tom O'Neill with Dan Piepenbring, argues that there is more to the story than the official version of events. According to Elisabeth Garber-Paul in Rolling Stone, the book ponders: \"the links between one of America's most notorious criminals and the government's super-secretive mind-control program MKULTRA\", and asks some disturbing questions: \"What explains the similarities between government funded, LSD-fueled mind-control experiments, and Manson's techniques? And why were there so many people in his orbit who seemed to have ties to the CIA?\" Now this investigation, which consumed 20 years of O'Neill's life, serves as the basis of a documentary by Errol Morris, the legendary director of The Thin Blue Line, The Fog of War and The Pigeon Tunnel.\nReleased on 7 March on Netflix internationally\nDirectors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely worked together on two of the biggest hits in cinema history, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Their next collaboration, The Gray Man, wasn't so well-received, but their new film sees them return to their comfort zone, ie, it's a visual effects-packed science-fiction epic. Based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, a Swedish artist and author, The Electric State is set in a dystopian alternate 1990s where the human race has won a war against robotkind, and the remaining \"bots\" have been exiled to a walled-off desert called the Exclusion Zone. Millie Bobby Brown plays an orphaned teenager, who treks across the Zone in search of her long-lost brother, and Chris Pratt plays a war veteran who goes with her. The only trouble is that the film's story is quite different from the novel's, and some of St\u00e5lenhag's fans aren't happy. \"Fan expectations are complicated,\" Joe Russo told\u00a0Digital Spy. \"There are characters that are directly out of the graphic novel and then there are characters that are completely invented and inspired by it.\"\nReleased on 14 March on Netflix internationally\nOne of this month's two \"having-your-life-changed-by-a-pet-you-didn't-really-want\" comedy dramas (the other being The Friend), The Penguin Lessons is based on a memoir by Tom Michell, and is directed by Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty). Steve Coogan plays Tom, an English teacher who gets what he imagines will be a cushy job in a boys' school in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1976. But there are two complications. One is that Argentina is in the midst of a military coup. The other is that Tom rescued a penguin he found drenched in oil on a beach, and now the bird won't leave him alone. Luckily enough, the penguin's presence in his classroom helps to motivate his pupils \u2013 and it might just teach the cynical Tom a lesson or two. Isabella Soares says in Collider that: \"Cattaneo's latest project is delightful and meaningful\", thanks to Coogan's \"charming\" performance and \"the script's keen eye for comedy in the face of a tumultuous backdrop\".\nReleased on 28 March in the US\nTwo films adapted from novels by Sigrid Nunez premiered last year, both of them musings on death and friendship among literary New Yorkers. One was Pedro Almod\u00f3var's The Room Next Door, which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival; the other is The Friend, which stars Naomi Watts, Bill Murray, and the most gigantic canine to be squeezed into a Manhattan apartment since Clifford the Big Red Dog. Watts plays an author named Iris, and Murray plays her roguish mentor Walter. After he kills himself, Iris has to look after his Great Dane, and finds that the dog is sadder about Walter's death than most of the human beings who knew him. Steve Pond in The Wrap says: \"The Friend juggles the happy, the sad and the bittersweet while somehow managing not to lose the lightness that has kept it afloat.\"\nReleased on 21 March in the US\nAlain Guiraudie, the French writer-director of the award-winning Stranger by the Lake, returns with another blackly comic, sexually charged thriller. F\u00e9lix Kysyl plays J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, a young man who returns to his rural hometown for the funeral of his mentor, a local baker. The baker's widow (Catherine Frot) invites him to stay in the family home, and perhaps even take over the family business, much to the resentment of the couple's grown-up son, Vincent (Jean-Baptiste Durand). And then someone disappears in the mossy woodland by the village. Isaac Feldberg at RogerEbert.com calls Guiraudie's film \"another elegantly haunting dissection of the power dynamics shaping queer sexuality, this time in the form of a fantastically tender, alluring, and peculiar small-town tale of murder, desire, and repression\".\nReleased on 14 March in Spain, 21 March in the US, and 28 March in the UK and Ireland\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "The Jane Austen-hits-LA comedy changed fashion, language and cinema. As it turns 30 and a new stage musical version opens, its writer and director discusses why it's so personal to her.\nBack in 1995, Clueless offered a cheeky update of Jane Austen's Emma in a Los Angeles high school and, without even seeming to try, revolutionised how we dress and talk. Tartan and preppy chic are still huge (note the blazer and mini-skirt wore by Taylor Swift in London last August, or the pop star's yellow-and-black combo at an MTV awards do in September). Meanwhile, \"As if!\", the catchphrase of its heroine Cher, which originated as a piece of Californian slang, has become ubiquitous. Will you be spared the phrase in this article? As if!\nBecause the film is brightly coloured and revolves around teenage girls, some critics at the time undersold the sharpness of its satire, which targets (among other things) white, west coast privilege, the plastic surgery industry, celebrity do-gooding, taboos surrounding menstruation, the cruelly low wages of teachers, and the kind of Nietzsche-reading liberal male who feels compelled to grow a goatee.\u00a0\nThe popularity of Clueless triggered a rash of insouciantly smart high-school-meets-classic literature movies (including 10 Things I Hate About You, Cruel Intentions, and Easy A, to name but a few). Just as importantly, it started a trend for films and TV shows that focussed on friendships between teenage girls. Thanks not only to the script but also a flawless cast and tip-top soundtrack (so\u00a0much Radiohead), audiences of all ages found themselves rooting for salty protagonists, Cher, Dionne and Tai, who dominate the proceedings in a way that hadn't been seen before in a mainstream US film. Yes, there's a rom-com element to the plot, but it's the tensions between the girls that generate the most heat. Cher's complex interactions with Dionne and Tai paved the way for Buffy and Willow's textured relationship in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Also, not to be bitchy, but without Clueless there'd be no Mean Girls. And Olivia Wilde cited it as an inspiration for her riotous directing debut, Booksmart, itself a modern teen movie classic.\u00a0\nYet 70 year-old\u00a0Amy Heckerling, the film's writer-director, claims she had no idea Clueless would be a hit. \"Nobody is ever sure of that,\" she tells the BBC. \"Well, maybe some people are sure of it. Not me.\" Nor does she know if a new West End musical based on the film, for which she wrote the book, will click with audiences; it is currently running in previews ahead of an opening night in March. What matters, she says, is that she enjoyed working on both projects. She says of the musical, \"It will either work or it won't, but I'm loving doing it.\" As for the film, \"I have to admit, on that shoot I was happier than I've ever been. There were no big prima donnas. It was the closest I've ever come to imagining a movie in my brain and seeing it unfold\u00a0exactly\u00a0how I imagined.\"\nIn the last three decades there's also been a three-season Clueless TV show, a book series, and another go at a stage musical, which premiered on Broadway in 2018. Still, it's the original film we keep coming back to and that Heckerling, Zooming from her home in New York, wants to discuss.\u00a0\nAs in Austen's 1815 novel, the plot revolves around a self-absorbed daddy's girl. Cher (Alicia Silverstone; putty-soft and irresistible) bombs around Beverly Hills with best-friend Dionne (Stacey Dash; poised), obsessed with matchmaking and make-overs. Cher is determined to \"help\" a new girl at school \u2013 dishevelled New Yorker Tai (Brittany Murphy; volcanically beguiling) \u2013 and proceeds to treat Tai like a toy. That is, until Tai fights back and Cher, her mind blown, realises that Tai is her equal. Which is where Heckerling veers off from Austen (whose heroine is ultimately horrified by her protege's \"notions of self-consequence\"). Here's the truth about Clueless. It's not as good as Emma. It's way better.\u00a0\nHeckerling suspects that the film has such a loyal following (and keeps picking up new acolytes) because its \"two princesses\", Cher and Dionne, are so human: \"They rag on each other like real friends do.\" She thinks it's stayed relevant because space is given to characters who \"care about the environment\", including Cher's ex-step-brother, Josh, (played by sexy goofball Paul Rudd) and Cher's Greenpeace-supporting teacher, Miss Geist (a delightfully frazzled but unbowed Twink Caplan). Heckerling says, \"Having those people worry about stuff like that makes the audience relate to them. Well, that's what I've always assumed. I'm not a major activist, but I care about a lot of things.\" Heckerling is also proud of the film's many \"wonderful\" teens, some of them gay \u2013 like the closeted, blazingly charismatic Christian (Justin Walker) \u2013 others broke and scruffy, like lollygagging stoner Travis (Breckin Meyer).\u00a0\nBorn in the Bronx, to an often cash-strapped family, the pale and petite Heckerling has never felt like a top dog and happily acknowledges that her status as an outsider bled into Clueless's sly take on class conflict. She says that when she first went to California, to attend the American Film Institute, people made fun of how she talked. \"They'd go, 'Amy, you want some [she adopts a cartoonish New York accent] quawfee?' Their attitude was like, 'You're talking some old-fashioned, lower-class, New York language. What planet are you from?'\" On the one hand, it was wounding. On the other hand, she wanted to find a way to fight back: \"I didn't feel like I wanted to change how I spoke or who I was.\"\nAmy Heckerling's Five Culture Shifters\nFranz Kafka\n\nFranz Kafka changed modern literature\u2026 OK, maybe Joyce did that, too, but wouldn't you rather read Kafka? It's not even like reading, it's like entering a nightmare with a sense of humour. And I think most adolescents can relate to waking up from troubling dreams to find they've turned into horrible vermin.\nThe Twilight Zone\nWhen I was a teenager, everyone smoked pot daily, except me. I was addicted to The Twilight Zone, and pot made me worry the stories could come true. And some have. In Midnight Sun, it's always 120 degrees (49 Celsius) and the oceans dried up. How brilliant was Rod Serling?\nJames Cagney\n\nI first fell in love with Cagney when I was a toddler. He was a ball of energy, like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck. When I was a teenager and interested in boys, he was my main crush. In film school, I appreciated his acting and I admire how he led his life.\u00a0\nA Clockwork Orange and 1984 (the books and films)\n\nI'm combining these because what I love is the language. I don't go a day without saying \"Free me glassies\". The future teen slang in A Clockwork Orange (Anthony Burgess) was stylish and thrilling. George Orwell's creation of \"Newspeak\" was genius. The language of 1984 was deliberately getting smaller because without words, there's no thinking, and therefore, no intelligent resistance.\nThat's when she started keeping a notebook of all the new words used by her fellow students and, in the years that followed, any socio-economic tribes she encountered. She says she was especially interested in the \"very\" words \u2013 technically known as adverbs of degree, such as 'totally', 'majorly' and 'way' \u2013 \"because those 'very' words really define who you are, where you live and what year it is\". Which, of course, came in super handy for Clueless. Via the film, Heckerling demonstrates her complete mastery of LA lingo. At the same time, she finds a way to do justice to her own clique, aka earthy New Yorkers.\nClueless immortalises a whole bunch of characters who use Big Apple vocabulary and/or talk with unapologetically broad New York accents; there's Tai, but also Christian, Cher's dad Mel (Dan Hedaya), and a driving examiner (Ron Orbach). Nor is it a coincidence that we're shown a hilarious clip of a \"Bronx-y\" Tony Curtis, looking most uncomfortable in Spartacus (or, in Cher-speak, \"Sporadicus\"). According to Heckerling, Curtis delivers his lines in the way he does (ie at a snail's pace) because he's trying to appear more \"classy\". It's a tactic she's tried herself. \"When you feel kind of insecure about your accent, you try to talk\u00a0more slowly, as though that will get the Bronx out of it.\" The subliminal message sent by Clueless: Don't try to hide who you are. Own it.\u00a0\nSome fans, however, have long believed Heckerling has herself concealed something very important about the film, namely Cher's Jewish identity. It's hard to ignore Cher's Jewish surname (Horowitz), or the mezuzah (a piece of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah) on her family's front door. Yet, until now, Heckerling has been keen to shut down theories about Cher's ethnicity, pointing out that Cher's surname was originally meant to be Hamilton, and that Horowitz came from an ad lib by Wallace Shawn (as Cher's teacher).\u00a0\nHeckerling is proud of her own Jewish roots, and as well as being in love with the Yiddish language (note Dionne's use of the word kvelling), she believes representation is incredibly important. So why, when it comes to Cher, does Heckerling not want to confirm what seems obvious? Whatever Heckerling's intentions when she was writing the script, the character we see in the film is coded as Jewish. If you know what to look for, it's as plain as, well, that mezuzah. Like someone preparing to put down heavy luggage, Heckerling sighs. \"I didn't want to say Cher was Jewish,\" she explains, because \"when you're Jewish, there's always some group that's going to be mad at you\". Another sigh. \"So you don't want to make a big thing of it.\"\u00a0\nHeckerling claims that the most autobiographical scene in Clueless is the one in which Dionne (who, like Cher, has a somewhat kamikaze approach to driving) suddenly finds herself on the freeway and freaks out. Heckerling says that she identifies with the feeling of \"not being a very secure driver and suddenly you're in this situation where cars that are very big are coming right up and honking loudly. You're afraid to change lanes, because your car doesn't have the power to zip in and out and it's very frightening. I would often accidentally find myself on the freeway, just screaming till the exit was there!\"\nThe image of Heckerling in her puny car, screaming her head off, is a comical one, but also feels like an apt metaphor for this film-maker's relationship with Hollywood. Pre-and-post Clueless, she was often made to feel as if she didn't belong in the big league (studios were stingy about budgets; bigwigs tried to bury her projects; she was continually messed around when it came to distribution). Which is crazy. Heckerling is actually responsible for two all-time classic films \u2013 her 1982 debut, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, launched the careers of Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh and successfully tackled taboo topics like teen abortion. On top of that, Heckerling created the massively successful franchise, Look Who's Talking (inspired by her own daughter, Mollie). The good news is that Clueless, an iconic juggernaut if ever there was one, has allowed Heckerling to keep going. Here she is, 30 years later, still holding her ground and her nerve.\u00a0\nShe has plenty of projects in the pipeline. She and Mollie have written a script for Look Who's Talking 4 and are now waiting for feedback. She's also researching a historical Jewish figure (\"I've made a million notes\"). And she would kill to work with Benedict Cumberbatch. Like her own, dearly departed mother (\"the original Cumberbitch!\"), Heckerling \"worships\" the British actor. \"Whenever I'm feeling crummy I'll put on Sherlock, or the Richard III he did for The Hollow Crown [BBC series of Shakespeare history plays],\" she says. \"I can't stand being in the sun. Or the desert. But if he said, 'Let's do a Lawrence of Arabia remake,' I'd be there.\"\nSerious money has been pumped into the new West End musical. In London, you can't miss the posters, which show Cher, hands on hips, in her yellow tartan suit. Heckerling is pleased with the show because it \"doesn't feel like a different animal\" to the film. \"Some characters have a little more presence than others but, if you like the film, I think you'll feel the show is telling essentially the same story\". Scottish-singer songwriter KT Tunstall, known for hits like Suddenly I See, did the score, while Glenn Slater came up with the lyrics, and their idea has been to create songs that together sound like a 90s mixtape, aping the sound of era-defining acts from Radiohead to Green Day to NSYNC. Heckerling says that she and Slater spent a lot of time working together. \"Me and Glenn would go through the lyrics, with me telling him what the characters were feeling. I'd sometimes tell him, 'Woah, she wouldn't say this!' and changes were made. But, basically, I was so pleased with what he was doing.\"\u00a0\nShe's all too aware that theatre is a different medium. \"In films, you get to do close-ups of people, you can get into their\u00a0brains. In a musical comedy, the characters have to reach the last person in the audience with a song. Hopefully people will like the songs.\"\nThe interview is almost over. So much has changed, Heckerling confides, since she made the 1995 film. She's concerned, these days, about censorship and surveillance, \"I'm worried about how much trouble you can get in to right now. It seems like Big Brother is watching everything you do.\" She calls out, mischievously, \"Hi Big Brother! We're just talking about a silly film!\"\u00a0\nMemories of those \"wonderful\" days on the Clueless set spur her on. She says that many of her friends aren't working and \"don't even\u00a0want\u00a0to be working\". She tuts with amazement. \"It seems very strange to me. I can't imagine not wanting to\u2026\" She searches for the right word, keen as ever to avoid sounding presumptuous or highfalutin. She says, \"I will always want to be\u00a0creating. That's why you're alive, right?\"\nClueless, The Musical is London's Trafalgar Theatre until 27 September 2025.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "As the new US president makes massive governmental cuts, issues tariffs and leads an immigration crackdown, domestic and international tourism faces unprecedented changes.\nIn the United States, a new presidential administration always comes with policy shifts. But the dizzying speed with which President Donald Trump has issued executive orders and made sweeping federal changes during the first month of his second term has much of the world wondering what the long-term impacts of these changes might be, and what else is yet to come.\nBy threatening and instituting tariffs on longtime allies, moving to overhaul the US immigration system, promising \"mass deportations\" and empowering unelected billionaire Elon Musk to fire thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies established by Congress, Trump has come out swinging in his second act. And while these policy shifts are likely to have far-reaching social, political and economic implications, experts say they will also have a huge impact on the US travel industry.\u00a0\n\"From immigration rules to trade wars, these changes will make travel to and within the US a lot more complicated and way less appealing. It's like putting up a giant 'Do not enter' sign just as the world is getting back into full travel mode,\" said Kristin Winkaffe, founder of travel firm Winkaffe Global Travel. \"If you make it harder for people to get visas, fewer people will come \u2013 it's that simple.\"\nThis already appears to be playing out with the US's northerly neighbour. As Trump continues to threaten tariffs against Canada, even proposing annexing the entire nation, some Canadians have started boycotting US travel. The US Travel Association has warned that a 10% reduction in Canadian visits could result in more than $2bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\nYet, the new administration remains confident that its policy shifts will benefit travellers. \"President Trump has entrusted this team to work tirelessly to reaffirm American's [sic] complete confidence in the safety of our transportation systems,\" newly appointed US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"Our focus remains on ushering in a golden age of transportation while prioritizing the Department's core mission of safety and delivering innovative projects that move America.\"\u00a0\nWhile the full scale of Trump's policy changes are yet to be seen, experts and travel professionals are keeping a close eye on the specific ways they may reshape travel. We spoke to some of them to find out how these impacts might affect domestic and international travellers.\nPerhaps no mode of travel has been more scrutinised in recent weeks than the aviation industry. In the past month, four fatal plane crashes in the US have led confidence in air travel to drop from 71% of Americans believing air travel is safe in January 2025, to 64% in February, according to a recent AP survey.\u00a0\nTrump's recent policy changes aren't likely to improve this number. Air traffic control staffing was already under pressure nationwide and has been indicated as the cause of near-misses. Yet, even after investigations into the recent crash in Washington DC that killed 67 passengers found that air traffic control staffing was not at normal levels, Trump's administration began firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees last week. He has also fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Coast Guard, and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, leaving some wondering if aviation safety would continue to be a federal priority.\nThe State Department also suspended all processing of passports with the X identity marker, leaving many non-binary Americans potentially cut off from international travel. More than 15 countries \u2013 including Australia, Canada, Colombia and India \u2013 allow citizens to amend their gender to non-binary or third gender, so it is yet to be determined how these visitors will be treated upon entry.\nIn addition, more than 200 TSA employees have been laid off so far, and many expect screening times \u2013 especially among international visitors \u2013 to go up. Some LGBTQ+ travellers, in particular, are concerned about how recent policy changes will affect air travel.\n\"States like Texas, which is a hub for two of the three major US carriers, are looking at enforcing bathroom use in all public buildings (including airports) along the lines of the binary sex you were assigned at birth,\" said Lindsey Danis, creator of outdoor travel blog Queer Adventurers. \"Trans people would have to choose between complying with a law that would force use of the bathroom that aligns with their former gender or breaking the law and possibly being targeted for being in the 'wrong bathroom'.\"\nWith Trump threatening to tariff Canadian oil starting in March, experts expect gas prices to rise as much as $0.15 per gallon, potentially putting a damper on holiday road trips. Some believe that the president's focus on increasing domestic oil and gas production may temper the effects of tariffs on domestic gas prices, but that may take longer to see at the pump.\nEven those with electric vehicles may have more trouble charging. Earlier this month, the Trump administration paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, a clean energy initiative that had allocated billions of dollars for states to create electric car charging stations since 2021.\u00a0\nThose hoping to drive to or through one of the US's spectacular national parks may also face extra challenges. President Trump recently fired 1,000 national park workers, leaving many to suspect that the staffing shortages will result in maintenance issues, shorter visitor centre hours and fewer amenities for travellers. Yosemite National Park, for instance, has already delayed its summer campground reservations.\nSimilarly, federal funding for train travel seems to be an area that the Trump administration has eyed cutting. As part of recent spending freezes (some of which were temporarily rescinded recently), the US Department of Transportation is under scrutiny, in particular for its rail-related spending. Experts think this is likely to affect the $22bn in annual Amtrak funding, the development of high-speed rail corridors and intercity passenger rail service and grants for railroad safety programmes (which work to improve dangerous railroad crossings).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The Overseas Highway: The US's 'floating highway'\nIt's not that rail is universally under attack, but some suspect that Trump may be looking to further privatise the industry. \"Right now, there's a bigger push for private companies to take the lead in rail investment, which could bring fresh ideas and innovation but also raises questions about accessibility,\" said public policy advisor Justin Goldsberry. \"Will ticket prices rise? Will service improve, or become limited in certain areas?\"\nThe leisure and hospitality industry is one of the US economy's biggest sectors, employing more than 10% of the American workforce. But policy uncertainty hasn't been good for business, especially from international business travellers.\n\"The US is one of the largest markets for business events (especially exhibitions), and leading US shows rely on a solid share of international and overseas attendees,\" said Kai Hattendorf, CEO at the global business events company HTF and former CEO of UFI The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry. \"Policy uncertainty is disruptive for the sector, as event businesses crave predictability as they are planning years out, working with destinations and all actors from the travel and hospitality ecosystem.\"\nHe points to tech event CES in Las Vegas this past January when visitors from certain countries, including China, were down significantly. Hattendorf is noticing a growing number of events reportedly cancelled due to funding pulled from US government agencies and divisions as they enact new policies.\nOther experts expect that as Trump's immigration crackdown looms, restaurants, hotels and \u2013 by extension \u2013 travellers are likely to feel the effects.\n\"The hospitality industry, one of the largest employers of immigrant workers, will take a direct hit if work visas like the H-2B become more restricted,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"Post-pandemic labour shortages nearly brought the industry to its knees. If we see another round of restrictions, expect rising costs, declining service and economic losses in major travel hubs like New York, Miami and Los Angeles.\"\nPresident Trump's executive order focusing on \"foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats\" also put visas for foreign nationals in jeopardy. The order directs the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to implement enhanced vetting for both visa applicants and those currently in the country in order \"to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or [its] national interests\".\nThis means delays for those applying for visas, and visa appointments are likely to be delayed or suspended. Legal experts suspect particular scrutiny of those from high-risk countries, and most suspect a similar travel ban as was enacted in 2017 to be enacted once more.\n\"For international travellers, heightened visa scrutiny and extended processing times could mean fewer visitors and billions in lost tourism revenue,\" said Sillaman. \"If the US makes itself a harder place to visit or do business, the rest of the world isn't going to wait. Other countries \u2013 Canada, the UK, Australia \u2013 are already rolling out policies to attract the talent that America risks turning away.\"\nThis could be especially problematic because the US is entering what policymakers are describing as a \"mega decade\" of sporting events. In 2026 the US will co-host the FIFA World Cup in 11 American cities, followed by the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, the Men's Rugby World Cup in 2031, the Women's Rugby World Cup in 2033 and the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034. Yet, a recent report by the US Travel Association put it bluntly: \"We're not ready to host the upcoming mega decade of events that will draw millions of domestic and international travellers.\"\nAs US Travel Association CEO and president Geoff Freeman writes, slow visa processing times are the \"single biggest deterrent to visiting the US\". According to the State Department, wait times for visitor visas from certain nations such as Colombia can run up to 700 days, making it impossible for many travellers to attend next summer's FIFA World Cup. According to an Oxford Economics study cited in the report, if unaddressed, these days could result in a loss of nearly $19bn in spending in the next two years.\n\"America is staring at a historic opportunity,\" Freeman stated. \"The question is whether we will seize the moment or fall maddeningly short.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant.\u00a0Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare.\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right \u2013 she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\u00a0\nThe playwright\u00a0never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\u00a0\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\u00a0\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady\n\u2022\u00a0The historic female gang who menaced London\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her\u00a02011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s\u00a0that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\u00a0\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest.\u00a0\"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\u00a0\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" \u2013 one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\u00a0\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Was Edward II gay?Ever since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". \"The actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC.",

        "article_text": "You might not know her name but chances are you've seen Sarah Dattani Tucker's work - more than 40 million have at least. \nShe's the creative director behind the video for Lola Young's Messy music video, the track that's earned the singer her first UK number one. \nShot on film, the visualiser shows Lola performing in a bare room with an enormous cake which, by the end, has been destroyed.\n\"The concept is inspired by intrusive thoughts,\" she says.\n\"The room is empty because it's supposed to represent a neutral space, like your head space.\"\nIt was one of seven films Sarah made for the pop star to accompany tracks from her second album, This Wasn't Meant for You Anyway.\nSarah's also worked with Arlo Parks and says she never imagined she could do this kind of job, let alone reach this level of success.\nPart of that, she says, is due to her Gujarati heritage.\n\"Sometimes people don't necessarily know where to place you,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\"As a South Asian in the music industry, I often feel really misunderstood.\n\"There's so few of us in the wider industry.\"\nSarah was born and raised just outside of Manchester to a British dad and a Gujarati mum who was born in Uganda.\nAt school, Sarah says she loved art but was never shown how she might be able to turn that into a career.\n\"I did not come from a family of creatives,\" she says. \n\"I don't want to stereotype in any way, but I would say most of my family are like accountants or pharmacists.\"\nAnd while she says she was never discouraged from pursuing her passion, when she took her first steps in the industry \"family members definitely didn't fully understand exactly what my job was\".\n\"I definitely had to keep reminding everyone that this is a real job.\"\nFeeling misunderstood wasn't limited to school and family life though. Even now Sarah says she can feel out of place in the music industry.\n\"The music industry is so based on genre, and sometimes I've felt like people look at me and they're like, 'oh, you can't really work on this or that'.\n\"I've definitely really struggled with it. It's been really hard.\"\nThe latest diversity report by UK Music recorded that in 2024, 7.6% of people working in the music industry identified as Asian. \nThe group represents all sectors of the industry and noted there had been \"positive movement in the right direction\", with people from minority backgrounds now representing more than 25% of the workforce - up from 15.6% when the survey started in 2016. \n\"Nonetheless barriers still exist and we must continue to seek change,\" the report said.\n\"There is a lot of misunderstanding and lack of acknowledgement sometimes,\" Sarah says. \nAnd a lack of acknowledgement is something she'd like to address not just for British Asians, but the people working behind the scenes in the music industry too.\nLola Young is up for best pop act at Saturday's Brit Awards and, until 2019, music videos had a chance to be nominated for prizes too.\nThat award, British Video of the Year, no longer exists - it was last won by Little Mix for their Woman Like Me video. \nOther big awards like the Grammys still make a point of celebrating music videos and even go one step further with an award for best recording package, which goes to the artistic director behind a project.\nThis year it was won by Charli XCX and her creative director Imogene Strauss for Brat, which took on a life of its own - even being named Collins Dictionary 2024 word of the year. \n\"That's such a special moment because that campaign and the creative behind it is incredible,\" Sarah says.\nShe'd like to see would like to see similar opportunities for recognition at the Brits. \n\"It would be nice to have that kind of recognition, just because it is such a big production.\n\"There's so many parts to a campaign, it's so multifaceted.\"\nThe Brit Awards have not yet responded to Newsbeat's request for comment.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Households will need to make significant changes to their lifestyles to help the UK reach net zero by 2050, says the government's independent climate advisers.\nIn its latest advice, known as the carbon budget, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says by 2040, 80% of cars should be electric and one in two homes have a heat pump.\nHere are some of the ways it says you can cut greenhouse gas emissions: \nDecarbonising home heating will be essential if the country is going to reach its legally binding net zero target by 2050.\nOur homes are the second biggest source of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions after transport, and 80% of those emissions are from gas boilers. The proportion has been increasing as the country generates more electricity from low-carbon technologies like renewables and nuclear.\nThe CCC is backing heat pumps as the main replacement for gas boilers and rules out using hydrogen.\nIt says only about 60,000 UK homes installed a heat pump in 2023. It wants that figure to be 450,000 by 2030 and 1.5 million by 2035. \nHowever, it recognises that is going to be difficult. A key problem is heat pumps are typically more expensive than gas boilers, even after the government's \u00a37,500 grant. And because they heat water to a lower temperature than boilers, they work better in well-insulated homes with larger radiators or underfloor heating.\nThe committee says the government needs to consider schemes to help lower income households cover at least some of the costs of these changes.\nThe hope is that as boilers break down, consumers will replace them with heat pumps. The report doesn't recommend a ban on new boilers but says by 2035 all new heating systems should be low carbon.\nA quarter of UK emissions come from transport \u2013 excluding aviation \u2013 making it another priority for carbon cuts. But the CCC is less worried about how these will be achieved.\nThat is because it believes continuing reductions in the cost of batteries and other technologies mean electric cars and vans (EVs) could be cheaper to buy than petrol and diesel vehicles as soon as next year. This is significantly cheaper when you take into account running costs. It believes we will naturally choose them when we're looking for a new car.\nIn 2023, 16% of new cars were fully electric - the government says that will be 55% by 2027 and 95% by 2030.\nThe CCC says government will need to support the rollout of the charging network, and that the cost of charging needs to fall and payment be simplified.\nIt expects the switchover will become increasingly rapid, partly because it believes it will become more difficult to buy petrol and diesel, as it is expected there will be fewer petrol stations by 2040. \nWe are going to need to change our diets, the CCC says. That is because agriculture is the fourth highest emitting sector in the UK economy and nearly two-thirds (63%) of those emissions are from livestock.\nHowever, the CCC is careful not recommend restrictions on what we eat. Instead, it anticipates the current slow drift towards more plant-based foods will continue in the years to come. By 2040 it estimates we will be eating 25% less meat and 20% less dairy.\nMeat products will initially be replaced by existing alternative protein products like plant-based burgers, but in later years it expects us to start eating more \"alternative proteins\".  These include oils and meat grown from animal cells in bio-reactors - fermentation tanks like you might see in a brewery. The first product using these cultivated meats for animal consumption went on sale earlier this month.\nOur changing diets will mean cattle and sheep numbers will need to fall by 27% as a result, it says. That will allow a shift towards woodland creation, the restoration of the country's peatlands and allow more land to be used to grow energy crops.\nUK farmers will need to be supported during this transition, it advises, and the government will need to be careful to ensure that low-carbon UK food is not just replaced by higher-carbon products imported from abroad.\nAviation is currently the sixth biggest source of UK emissions, but by 2040 the CCC reckons it will be the biggest.\nIn the past the committee has advised government there should be no expansion of UK airports without a clear plan to cut emissions from the sector. The government is expected to announce its support for a new runway at Gatwick on Thursday, so is likely to be relieved the CCC has dropped that recommendation from this latest carbon budget.\nBut it says the aviation industry will need to pick up the tab for the costs of decarbonising the sector. That is going to require technological innovation \u2013 more efficient jets and electric planes \u2013 and the increasing use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).\nSAF is made from plant products or by combining captured CO2 with hydrogen. Just 1% of jet fuel is currently SAF, but the CCC expects that to rise to 17% by 2040.\nAny emissions the industry cannot eliminate will need to be offset by what the CCC calls \"engineered removals\". That means using technologies to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it permanently underground.\nAll of which is going to be expensive and will drive up ticket prices. The CCC expects those higher prices will slow down the increase in passenger numbers in years to come. However, it still expects a 28% increase in passenger numbers by 2050 \u2013 with UK residents taking a total of 402 million flights a year.\nIt has a warning though. If all that new tech doesn't cut emissions as much as the industry is expecting, the government may need to impose limits on flight numbers.",

Another said in a post tagging Lloyds Bank's X account they had been told to transfer funds into their account, but could not due to the issues affecting its app. \"Now this month you've gone down on payday,\" they added.The Treasury Committee recently wrote to the bosses of nine banks asking for information about the scale and impact of IT failures on customers.Cash access and infrastructure concernsThe latest bank IT problems highlight concerns about a shift towards mobile and internet banking services impeding peoples' access to physical cash and bank branches.Martin Quinn, the director of campaign group Campaign for Cash, said Friday's banking app issues demonstrated society's over-reliance on technology. \"Some people may miss important bill payments, find themselves unable to pay for essential services or risk going overdrawn, all of which could have serious consequences,\" she said.One user told the Lloyd's Bank social media account on X that they could not access their business account to pay their staff. \"This proves that now more than ever a strong bank branch network [is needed], as when outages happen, we need face-to-face banking,\" he told the BBC.Disability rights groups are also calling for access to physical cash to be protected.Meanwhile, Patrick Burgess, a cyber-security expert with the Chartered Institute for IT, said the Lloyds issues on Friday showed \"how fragile parts of the legacy banking system still are\".High street banks still rely on \"outdated infrastructure\" that may face extra strain in moments of high demand, such the month-end, he added.Professor Markos Zachariadis, chair of financial technology at the University of Manchester, told the BBC that if financial institutions cannot keep pace with demand or deal with technical issues, \"the economy will suffer many times at a high cost\".It may also add to pressures on consumer trust in traditional banks, says Shilpa Doreswamy of GFT Technologies.",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nThe 21-year-old, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nEdie points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nAlso involved in the film was Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance.\nShe says Madison installed a pole at her house in LA, and the pair began working on her \"sexy routine\".\n\"She put in so much work,\" Schneider, 28, said. \"She was so determined.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Schneider, meanwhile, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

It's a bargain.\"\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also at the meeting, said the gold visas would replace the current visa programme for foreign investors, but offered few details.\nDozens of countries around the world offer some sort of citizenship by investment programme, including several in Europe, like Portugal, which gives \"golden visas\", or permanent residency for foreigners who invest \u20ac500,000 ($524,000) into a qualifying fund. \nTrump said companies would use the golden visa programme to hire non-citizens to work for them in the US. \n\"We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,\" Trump said.  \nTypically, green card holders in the US can apply for citizenship after five years. \nTrump suggested revenue from the high-priced visas could be used to pay off US debt. \nLutnick said that the initiative will replace the EB-5 visa, which gives permanent residency to some foreigners who invest around $1m and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US.\nSaying the EB-5 programme was \"poorly overseen and poorly executed\",  Lutnick said the golden visas would be an improvement.\n\"We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,\" Lutnick said of future gold card applicants. \nIt was not immediately clear how the government would select recipients, if there were exclusions, or if there would be any cap on how many are issued.\nDuring the fiscal year of 2024, the State Department issued over 12,000 EB-5 visas, a record high for the programme.",

        "article_text": "Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine.\nFor those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance.\n\"It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,\" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral.\n\"Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live.\"\nYulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is.\nBefore the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%.\nBefore Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%.\n\"They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,\" says 30-year-old Andriy. \"They don't respect the people of Ukraine.\"\n\"It looks like Washington supports Russia!\" observes Dmytro, 26.\nYou wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity.\n\"When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,\" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling.\nWorld leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune.\nHis ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.\nBut Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty.\nNot least with his warming to Russia.\nThe initial reaction was that of shock,\" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun.\n\"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,\" she adds. \"It's painful.\"\nUkrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed.\nPerhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested.\n\"We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,\" argues Sovsun.\nThere are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate.\n\"It's important to find the right mediator,\" she says. \"Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy.\n\"Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy.\"\nPresident Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians.\n\"We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,\" she adds. \"Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war.\"\nWhat the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent.\n\"This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,\" she says.\nWhile there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations.\nHer European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky.\nHe was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as \"threats to national security\" and \"creating obstacles to economic development\". Mr Poroshenko said it was \"politically motivated\".\nDespite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary.\nAs sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it.\nRussia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions.\n\"This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,\" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation.\nAfter Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\"This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,\" he says.\nAs he ruthlessly pursues his \"America First\" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net.\n\"Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,\" says Mr Chmut.\n\"Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Svitlana Libet.",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

        "article_text": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\nBangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. \u00a0\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\u00a0\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night \u2013 daytime, office hours \u2013 we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nTip:\nIf you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes\u00a0Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui \u2013 and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns \u2013 you name it \u2013 Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite: https://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\nTip:\nNightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach \u2013 that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: https://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: @rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: https://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Almost all cases - 101 - were in patients 17 and younger.\nSpeaking at the first cabinet meeting of US President Donald Trump's current term on Wednesday, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr claimed that there had been two deaths. \nHowever, Katherine Wells, the director of the public health department in Lubbock, Texas, where the death occurred, clarified later that there has only been one.\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC clarifying the number of deaths. \nThe US declared that measles had been \"eliminated\" in 2000, but the country has seen outbreaks in recent years amid a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. The last US measles death was in 2015, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nThe current outbreak is centred in north-west Texas, with measles also recently found across the state's border in New Mexico, as well as Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New York City and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nCurrently, there are nine cases reported in New Mexico, four of whom are children.\nKennedy, a vaccine sceptic in the past, said that measles outbreaks were common and there have been four measles outbreaks so far in the US this year. The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases.\nHe also said his department was monitoring the current outbreak closely.\nA measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death.\nSurvivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).\nThere were 285 cases of measles reported in the US for all of last year, the highest number since 1,274 in 2019.\nSo far, 18 people in the current outbreak have had to go to hospital, according to the Texas health department. Kennedy said altogether 20 people were in hospital to quarantine.\nFive people in Texas who were infected had been vaccinated, the department also said. \nNew Mexico's congressional delegation pushed Kennedy to urgently address the current outbreak, urging him to \"launch a vaccination promotion campaign\" and rehire recently fired federal health workers, among other measures,  in a letter on Monday.\n\"Just last Friday, two dozen employees at the CDC charged with training public laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts were fired,\" the state's two senators and three House members, all Democrats, wrote. \n\"Those firings will worsen outbreaks and ultimately threaten the health of all Americans in the face of the next public health emergency.\" \nMeanwhile, areas affected by the outbreak are hosting free vaccination clinics, with the city of Lubbock, where the child victim died, holding hours-long clinics each day this week.\nThe Texas outbreak is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, and local media.\nMost US children receive two immunisation shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the CDC.\nVaccination rates in Texas are 94.3%, according to the CDC, which is below the 95% level that the Infectious Diseases Society of America says is needed to also protect those who are not immunized, commonly called \"herd immunity\".\n\"Measles was rare in the United States, but outbreaks are occurring in areas where vaccination rates have fallen,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement. \"Most children who get measles are not up to date on recommended vaccines or are not old enough to get measles vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.\nA man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"\n\"England.\"\n\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.\n\"Do you?\" I ask.\n\"A lot better than where I was before.\"\nWelcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.\nConcrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.\nThe UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.\nLooking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.\nJust one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.\nNo prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.\nJimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.\nHe's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.\n\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"\nDelgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.\nThe \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.\nCredits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.\nOff the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.\n\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"\nThe rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).\nThe BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.\n\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"\nShe believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"\nThe Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.\n\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"\nWhat would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"\nAs well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.\nMore people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.\nEven so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.\n\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.\nIt's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.\n\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.\nBut not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.\nSamantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.\n\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"\nIt's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?\nThe challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.\nThere is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.\nSo a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.\nBut this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.\nIt is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.\nIt is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.\nIn addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.\nThe narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".\nPerhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.\nThis strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes. \nThe UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.\nWhile the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.\nThe White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.\nLikewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.\nThis appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.\nThe prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.\nCould the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?\nThere are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.\nAnd even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.\nThat is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.\nThe PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.\nThe strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one.",

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise L\u00fcbeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot \u2013 a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket. Were England to find a way, their rebuild could gain a jump start.",

In March we only play one Premier League game - so we are not focused on the long term.\n\"Now the players have some days off and then we focus on Paris St-Germain [in the Champions League] more than we do on the table in the Premier League.\"\nGunners boss Mikel Arteta must know the jig is up but said before the Forest game he would concede the title \"over [his] dead body\".\nAfter the match, he told the BBC: \"It was the same a week ago, two weeks ago, three months ago.

        "article_text": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality.\nEven if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\nWhile many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations.\n\"When a person interprets a\u00a0Rorschach\u00a0image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data \u2013 information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\nAI v the Mind\nThis article is part of\u202fAI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\u00a0\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image \u2013 a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched \u2013 perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\n\"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\u00a0\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking \u2013 instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality \u2013 and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users \u2013 which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption \u2013 but it can muddy the waters around how they \u2013 and their outputs \u2013 are perceived.\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\nThat's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" \u2013 named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates \u2013 on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker \u2013 in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had \u2013 or created \u2013 a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\nWhile this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm \u2013 a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.)\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",
