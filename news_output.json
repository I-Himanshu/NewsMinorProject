        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nThe timing is right - Thomas set to retire at the end of the season\nLife as a cyclist is relentless, so after nearly 20 years of looking forward, eyes fixed on the road ahead, Geraint Thomas has not had much time to reflect on the past.\nThings are different now, though. This season will be Thomas' last of a sparkling career that has seen him win two Olympic gold medals, three World Championship titles, numerous road races and the sport's greatest prize of all, the Tour de France.\nA sport this gruelling does not allow its competitors the indulgence of turning an entire season into a glorified lap of honour but, as the end comes into view, Thomas is more contemplative than usual.\n\"Since I was a kid I dreamt of riding the Tour and being part of the Olympics and winning was obviously a dream as well, but to achieve that was just nuts,\" he tells BBC Breakfast.\n\"I think now the decision is official, you do start to reflect because when you're in it, it's just one thing after the next, year after year, so you don't really appreciate it. I guess at the time you enjoy it but I don't think you sit back and reflect and think, so there will be a bit of that this year.\"\nThis has been something of a long goodbye for Thomas, who indicated he would retire at the end of this year when he signed his most recent Ineos Grenadiers contract in 2023.\nFar from winding down, however, the Welshman has been reinvigorated in the twilight of his career, with last year's third place at the Giro d'Italia securing a Grand Tour podium finish for a third successive season.\nGeraint Thomas: A career in pictures\nThomas savours his moment with history in Rome\nThomas signs new contract with Ineos Grenadiers\nThis summer, the 38-year-old will concentrate on the Tour de France, where he will play a supporting role for the team and \"maybe try to win a stage but just enjoy the race\" that he won in 2018.\n\"Beijing was massive, my first Olympics and winning gold there,\" says Thomas. \"But the Tour's what changed my life, being recognised all over the place.\n\"I was in Alcatraz and some dude recognised me. I think that's when you know it went up a level.\n\"The yellow jersey is iconic. You go anywhere in the world and people will know the yellow jersey, how it signifies cycling and its history. So to be a part of that history and to win it, I just pinch myself.\"\nConsidering how competitive Thomas remains at the highest level, you would be forgiven for wondering why he is retiring.\n\"This is my 19th year as a professional and I didn't want to do one year too many and be the grumpy guy in the team,\" he explains.\n\"I'm still really enjoying it, I still feel competitive and the last year has been good, but I think the timing's right. With my family, I'm looking forward to moving back to Cardiff.\n\"There's stuff I think I'll miss, the racing, being here in Monaco, but it will be nice just to be around more and to take on a new challenge.\"\nGeraint Thomas: Over the Finish Line\nCycling superstar Geraint Thomas talks about deciding to retire, his extraordinary achievements, and life in elite sport. \nThomas has not yet decided what that new challenge will be, but he will have plenty of choice.\nThere is a chance he could stay with Ineos Grenadiers in a new capacity, while there will be no shortage of offers to work in the media.\n\"Having options is always good,\" Thomas says. \"I need a purpose. Since I was about 17 or 18, I've always been working towards a goal.\n\"To not be working towards anything would be nice for maybe a month, then I'll just go crazy, so I'll definitely have to have some goals.\n\"I want to do an Ironman. I only run two or three times a year, so that's something that needs a bit of work! It's about challenging myself in different ways.\"\nA future as a triathlete can wait. Once he retires, what Thomas is most looking forward to is spending more time with family and friends, particularly his wife Sara and five-year-old son Macs.\n\"That's the main thing, just being around more and not missing events - birthdays, weddings, parties or whatever,\" he adds. \"I'm looking forward to that side of things.\"\nRetirement is also bound to bring with it myriad offers to appear on reality TV programmes, although Thomas has been warned off Strictly Come Dancing.\n\"I reckon the fitness would be the only thing I've got. I wouldn't back myself. Although my parents-in-law tell me 'please don't do it, you'll make a fool of yourself' and that makes me want to do it,\" he laughs.\n\"That would be the biggest challenge of my life for sure. Maybe I've got the hips for it.\"\nHaving completed the 2013 Tour de France despite breaking his pelvis during the opening stage of the three-week race, Thomas has proved that he is ready to test that particular area of his anatomy.\nIn fact, there are few parts of Thomas' body that have not been bloodied or bruised at some point over the course of his career, and his physical fortitude has earned him the respect of his peers as well as cycling followers around the world.\nOnce he has navigated his final Tour de France and one last summer on the road, Thomas plans to bring the curtain down on his career at the Tour of Britain in September.\nThe route has not yet been finalised but the closing stage could be held in Cardiff, the city where Thomas was born and bred and where he will return to live after retiring.\n\"It would be epic if that happens. I haven't really thought about it much, but when I do start thinking about it, it's going to be emotional. Maybe I'll shed a tear or two,\" Thomas says.\n\"It would be some way to finish, whether it's Cardiff or wherever, the Tour of Britain as the final race. It's full circle, isn't it?

It was applauded as a historic milestone in global climate action.\nBarely a year later, however, there are fears that the global commitment may be losing momentum, as the growth of clean energy transition is slowing down while burning of fossil fuels continues to rise.\nAnd now there is US President Donald Trump's \"national energy emergency\", embracing fossil fuels and ditching clean energy policies  \u2013 that has also begun to influence some countries and energy companies already.\nIn response to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan aimed at ramping up fossil fuel extraction, and the US notifying the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Indonesia, for instance, has hinted that it may follow suit.\n\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara. \nIndonesia has remained in the list of top 10 carbon-emitting countries for years now.\n\"Indonesia produces three tons of carbon [per person a year] while the US produces 13 tons,\" he asked at the ESG Sustainable Forum 2025 in Jakarta on 31 January.\n\"Yet we are the ones being told to close our power plants... So, where is the sense of justice here?\" \nNithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.\nShe said the \"richest country and the largest oil producer in the world\" increasing its production gives other states \"an easy excuse to increase their own - which they are already doing\".\nIn South Africa, Africa's biggest economy and a major carbon emitter, a $8.5bn foreign-aided transition project from the coal sector was already moving at a snail's pace, and now there are fears that it may get derailed further.\nWikus Kruger, director of Power Futures Lab at the University of Cape Town, said there was a \"possibility\" that decommissioning of old coal-fired power stations would be \"further delayed\".\nHowever he said that while there was some \"walk back\" from transition to renewables, there was still growth in the clean energy sector that was expected to continue.\nArgentina withdrew its negotiators from the COP29 climate meeting in Baku last November, days after Trump won the US presidency. It has since followed Trump's lead in signalling it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement of 2015 - which underpins global efforts to combat climate change.\n\"We now expect our oil and gas production to go up,\"  Enrique Viale, president of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers, told the BBC.\n\"President Milei has hinted that he intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and has said environmentalism is part of the woke agenda.\"\nMeanwhile, energy giant Equinor has just announced it is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production,  and another oil major, BP, is expected to make a similar announcement soon.\nTrump has not just said \"drill, baby, drill\" but also: \"We will export American energy all over the world.\"\nPotential foreign buyers are already lining up.\nIndia and the US have agreed to significantly increase the supply of American oil and gas to the Indian market.\nAt the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".\nA few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.\nOfficials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.\nScientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.\n\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.\n\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"\nGlobal energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy, with the US said to have identified about 18,000 Indian nationals it believes entered illegally.\nLast week Narendra Modi said India would take back its nationals who were in the US illegally, and also crack down on the \"human trafficking ecosystem\".\n\"These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and promises,\" he said during his visit to Washington.\nNow a new paper by Abby Budiman and Devesh Kapur from Johns Hopkins University has shed light on the numbers, demographics, entry methods, locations and trends relating to undocumented Indians over time.\nHere are some of the more striking findings.  \nUnauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.\nThe number of undocumented Indians among them is contested however, with estimates varying widely due to differing calculation methods.\nPew Research Center and Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) estimate some 700,000 people as of 2022, making them the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador.\nIn contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) puts the figure at 375,000, ranking India fifth among origin countries. \nThe official government data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  offers yet another picture, reporting 220,000 unauthorised Indians in 2022.\nThe vast differences in estimates highlight the uncertainty surrounding the true size of the undocumented Indian population, according to the study. \nIndian migrants make up only a small share of the overall unauthorised migrant population in the US.\nIf Pew and CMS estimates are accurate, nearly one in four Indian immigrants in the US is undocumented - an unlikely scenario given migration patterns, the study says. (Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing groups in the US, surging from 600,000 in 1990 to 3.2 million in 2022.)\nThe DHS estimated in 2022 that the undocumented Indian population in the US dropped 60% from its 2016 peak, falling from 560,000 to 220,000. \nHow did the number of undocumented Indians drop so steeply from 2016 to 2022? Mr Kapur says the data doesn't provide a clear answer, but plausible explanations could be that some obtained legal status while others returned, particularly due to COVID-related hardships.\nHowever, this estimate doesn't reflect a 2023 surge in Indians at US borders, meaning the actual number could now be higher.\nDespite rising border encounters, US government estimates show no clear increase in the overall undocumented Indian population from the US financial year (FY) 2020 to 2022, according to the study.\nEncounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada.\nVisa overstays by Indians have remained steady at 1.5% since 2016.  \nThe number of Indian recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) has also declined from 2,600 in 2017 to 1,600 in 2024. The Daca programme protects migrants who came to the US as children. \nTo sum up: the undocumented Indian population grew both in numbers and as a share of all unauthorised migrants, rising from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.9% in 2015 before dropping to 2% in 2022.\nThe US has two main land borders. \nThe southern border along the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas bordering Mexico sees the most migrant crossings. Then there's the US-Canada border spanning 11 states.\nBefore 2010, encounters involving Indians at the two borders were minimal, never exceeding 1,000. \nSince 2010, nearly all encounters involving Indians occurred along the US-Mexico southern border. \nIn FY 2024, encounters of Indian nationals on the northern border surged to 36% of all Indian crossings, up from just 4% the previous year.\nCanada had become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with shorter visitor visa processing times than the US.  \nAlso, there was a surge in attempted border crossings from 2021 onwards, and the encounters at the Mexico border peaked in 2023.\n\"This is not specific to Indians. It is part of a larger surge of migrants trying to come into the US after Biden was elected. It is as if there was a high tide of migrants and Indians were a part of it,\" Mr Kapur told the BBC.\nThe study finds that the states with the largest Indian immigrant populations -California (112,000), Texas (61,000), New Jersey (55,000), New York (43,000) and Illinois (31,000) - also have the highest numbers of unauthorised Indian immigrants.\nIndians make up a significant share of the total unauthorised population in Ohio (16%), Michigan (14%), New Jersey (12%) and Pennsylvania (11%). \nMeanwhile, states where more than 20% of Indian immigrants are unauthorised include Tennessee, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and California.\n\"We expect this because it's easier to blend in and find work in an ethnic business - like a Gujarati working for a Gujarati-American or a Punjabi/Sikh in a similar setup,\" Mr Kapur said. \nThe US immigration system allows people who are detained at the border who fear persecution in their home countries to undergo credible \"fear screenings\". Those who pass can seek asylum in court, leading to a rise in asylum applications alongside rising border apprehensions.\nAdministrative data doesn't reveal the exact demographics of Indian asylum seekers, but court records on spoken languages provide some insight.\nPunjabi-speakers from India have dominated Indian asylum claims since 2001. After Punjabi, Indian asylum seekers spoke Hindi (14%), English (8%) and Gujarati (7%).\nThey have filed 66% of asylum cases from FY 2001\u20132022, suggesting Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana as key migrant sources.\nPunjabi speakers from India also had the highest asylum approval rate (63%), followed by Hindi speakers (58%). In contrast, only a quarter of Gujarati speakers' cases were approved.\nUS data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed.\nThe requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023.\nWhile this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says.\nMr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\". \nGiven the large number of Punjabi-speakers who seek asylum, it's unclear what has changed in the northern Indian state ruled by the Congress party (2017-22) and latterly the Aam Aadmi Party (2022\u2013present) to drive this surge.  \nUnder Trump's second presidency, asylum requests are set to plummet. \nWithin his first week, a key app for migrants was shut down and removed from app stores, cancelling nearly 300,000 pending appointments, including asylum cases already in progress.\nUS data shows most Indian asylum seekers are Punjabi and Gujarati - groups from India's wealthier states, better able to afford high migration costs. \nIn contrast, Indian Muslims and marginalised communities and people from conflict zones like the regions affected by Maoist violence and Kashmir, rarely seek asylum, the study says.\nSo most Indian asylum seekers are economic migrants, not from the country's poorest or conflict-hit regions.\nThe arduous journey to the US - whether via Latin America or as \"fake\" students in Canada - costs 30-100 times India's per capita income, making it accessible only to those with assets to sell or pledge, the study says.\nNot surprisingly, Punjab and Gujarat - top origin states for unauthorised Indians -  are among India's wealthier regions, where land values far exceed returns from farming.  \n\"Even illegality takes a lot of money to pursue,\" the study says. \nWhile rising asylum claims may seem linked to \"democratic backsliding\" in India, correlation isn't causation, the authors say .\nPunjab and Gujarat have long histories of emigration, with migrants heading not just to the US but also the UK, Canada and Australia. \nRemittances - India received an estimated $120bn in 2023 - fuel aspirations for a better life, driven not by poverty but \"relative deprivation\", as families seek to match the success of others abroad, the study says. \nA parallel industry of agents and brokers in India has cashed in on this demand. \nThe Indian government, says the study, \"has looked the other way, likely because the issue of illegal migration is much more a burden for receiving than sending countries\". \nBetween 2009 and 2024, around 16,000 Indians were deported, according to India's ministry of external affairs.  \nThese deportations averaged 750 per year under Obama, 1,550 under Trump's first term, and 900 under Biden.\nIndian migrant removals spiked between FY 2023 and 2024, but the peak was in 2020 with nearly 2,300 deportations.",

'Gaming the system' - why asylum claims are risingUS data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed.The requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023.While this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says.Mr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\". How many illegal Indians are in the US?Unauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.The number of undocumented Indians among them is contested however, with estimates varying widely due to differing calculation methods.Pew Research Center and Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) estimate some 700,000 people as of 2022, making them the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador.In contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) puts the figure at 375,000, ranking India fifth among origin countries.",

        "article_text": "With two major musicals in the awards race this year, it was only right that host David Tennant opened the Bafta Film Awards with a tune of his own. \nThe Scottish star kicked off proceedings with a storming rendition of The Proclaimers' 500 Miles, featuring contributions from Selena Gomez, Colman Domingo, Anna Kendrick, Hugh Grant and Camila Cabello.\nThe energy remained high throughout the ceremony, which saw Conclave and The Brutalist take the most prizes with four each. \nBackstage, the stars were in equally good spirits, even if a few of them were jet-lagged, hungry, and remarking on how heavy the Bafta trophy is to carry around.\nHere are eight highlights from the winners' room:\nWhen Anora star Mikey Madison collected the best actress award, she started by admitting to the audience that she hadn't prepared a speech.\nBackstage, she jokingly blamed this on Robert De Niro, whom she recently appeared with on The Graham Norton Show. \n\"I just wish that I'd had a better speech,\" she said.\n\"I was on a talk show and Robert De Niro told me not to write a speech and I thought, I should probably listen to him. And I forgot to thank so many important people.\"\nMadison was overwhelmed but overjoyed with the recognition from Bafta.\n\"I think I'm a little disassociated right now,\" she says, \"I love making movies, and being an actress is my dream, and for my film to be recognised like this is incredibly special.\n\"I don't know if I'll ever fully grasp the magnitude of being in a room like that, full of my idols, incredible creatives who I admire so much.\"\nWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl won two prizes for its producer Richard Beek and directors Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham. The trio brought their famous characters along with them to the ceremony.\nCrossingham reflected on the fact that stories about a cheese enthusiast and his loyal but long-suffering dog always seem to go down so well in the US, despite the films firmly rooted in UK culture.\n\"It is remarkable that our very Britishness is embraced in America,\" he told journalists.\nHe highlighted one particular reference in Vengeance Most Fowl: the TV presenter in the film is called Anton Deck, a reference to Geordie duo Ant & Dec.\n\"There are some jokes, like Anton Deck, which are very British. In the American screenings, there was complete silence apart from one Brit guffawing in the corner.\n\"But we're very proud of that, we stick to our guns. Apart from one or two very specific gags like that, it seems to be embraced.\n\"And even if they're laughing at us, not with us, if they're laughing, we're still happy about that.\"\nJesse Eisenberg, who won best original screenplay for A Real Pain, walked into the winners' room carrying his Bafta and asking journalists: \"Am I expected to hold this heavy thing the whole time?\"\nAfter being reassured he was allowed to put it down as he answered questions, he reflected on the fact that the screenwriting prizes he's won for A Real Pain have both been in the UK.\n\"The other award I won for this was the London Film Critics prize, so I must be living in the wrong country,\" he joked.\n\"My background is as a playwright, and when one of my plays transferred to the West End it was far more popular. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm a novelty here and in America I'm boring.\"\nEisenberg was also asked about his relationship with co-star Kieran Culkin, who won best supporting actor. But, he said, it's not as close as people might imagine.\n\"In terms of our dynamic, I'll text him today and say, 'hey you won the Bafta, I'm so proud of you'. And then three weeks later my phone will buzz and it'll be [Culkin saying]: 'Hey, I just got this, thanks'.\"\n\"That's the closeness with which you imagine we live.\"\nZoe Salda\u00f1a continued her awards season sweep of the best supporting actress category with another win at Bafta, despite the recent controversies faced by her film Emilia P\u00e9rez.\nBackstage, she reflected on her biggest number in the Spanish-language musical, El Mal, which is also up for best original song at the Oscars. \n\"Not getting in my own way was the challenge,\" she said of shooting it. \"Sometimes you can become very heady about something and you overthink it.\n\"What you have to do is trust the process... Rehearsing the dance was about reconnecting with a part of me I had missed so much but I had since let go of for more than 20 years.\n\"Reconnecting with that, dusting off all those cobwebs and jumping into the unknown was what needed to happen.\"\nAsked about the importance of performing the musical in Spanish, she replies: \"It's my first language, I was spoken to first, sung to first, in Spanish.\n\"We love we live, we fight, we work, in Spanish. And my art has [previously] only lived in a very English way. So that yearning to connect my culture with my art was meaningful to me.\"\nWarwick Davis was the recipient of this year's Bafta Fellowship, the British Academy's highest honour.\n\"It's very overwhelming, this whole thing,\" he said. \"You win the award and then you have to talk to loads of people, feeling very shiny.\" \n(Everyone was feeling sweaty backstage by this point.)\nAsked about the moment he heard he was this year's winner, Davis said: \"I was on the toilet when I found out!\n\"[Bafta] notified me by email, and I do most of my administration work on the toilet. I might call it paperwork but then you'd get the wrong idea,\" he jokes.\n\"Then I got an email from Bafta saying I'd won the fellowship, and I got all excited, and then it suddenly dawned on me, is this a fake email? Some sort of scam?\n\"So I clicked on the email address, and it really was Bafta. Then I finished up at the loo, you probably didn't need that detail, and then went and celebrated with the kids.\"\nAdrien Brody's reaction to winning best actor might have been slightly hampered by how hungry he is. \n\"I haven't eaten anything yet, so I'm not sure how I'm feeling, but I'm so happy to be here,\" he says backstage.\nBrody is asked about the surge his career has enjoyed in recent months thanks to The Brutalist, more than two decades after his last awards run for The Pianist.\n\"The beauty of being an actor is that any life experience, and there have been many since [The Pianist], anything you've experienced is so valuable in shaping a sense of understanding,\" he reflects.\n\"So the moments of triumph, loss, complexity along your path, they give you an ability to represent those more truthfully and authentically in your work.\n\"I'm just so grateful to have had this meaningful opportunity come my way, I've been yearning for this for a long time.\n\"I've been working very hard. It's not for a lack of hard work, but there are so many magical things that have to happen for a film to achieve greatness and I'm so happy that all of those things conspired on The Brutalist.\"\nAnd with that, he's off to have some supper.\nConclave won best film and best British film, becoming the first movie to take the top two prizes since 1917 (the film, not the year).\n\"I am so humbled and so grateful to be welcomed here so openly with such warmth and open arms,\" its German director Edward Berger says of the UK. \"Basically, I just want to live here, I'm never going to leave.\"\nHe likens the cast of Pope drama Conclave, which includes Stanley Tucci, Ralph Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini, to an orchestra.\n\"No-one really knows [why a cast works so well], but you have a hunch, so there's a lot of discussion - we put pictures up on the wall and it just felt like a good combination,\" he explained.\n\"They were all believable cardinals, all different nationalities and accents, it just felt they were all different instruments in a big musical piece.\"\nThe Brutalist's Brady Corbet might have won best director, but he said he was slightly too \"jet-lagged and exhausted\" to fully process it. \nAs much as he's enjoying awards season, he notes: \"It'll be amazing when it's done, I'm looking forward to getting back to work.\"\nCorbet is not shy of hard work - making the Brutalist was famously a labour of love which took several years. \"We basically just didn't sleep,\" he says. \"I haven't had a day off in years.\"\nNow that awards campaigning is in its final phase however, with voting for the Oscars closing on Monday, he should finally get some down time. \"The week leading up to the Oscars is actually pretty quiet, I'm looking forward to it.\"\nThe Brutalist, a 3.5-hour film with an intermission, has been a relative box office success despite its intimidating duration.\n\"I'm not trying to teach anyone a lesson or anything,\" he says, \"but I do think it's good for the ecosystem that a film like this which is completely uncompromised - I don't like too many cooks in my kitchen - for that to have made $30m globally so far, that's exciting.\n\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

        "article_text": "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.\nUK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.\nThe MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.\nAsked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.\nThe Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.\nThe rejection of their applications was controversial because they came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.\nThe inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.\nBBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.\nThe MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.\nThe confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.\nThe Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: \"There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.\"",

Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.\nThe Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: \"There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.\"\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?\nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.\nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\nSignal: 0044 7714 956 936\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

        "article_text": "A series of US declarations rocked last week's Munich Security Conference and caused discord among the European politicians in attendance.\nNow US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia next week to begin negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, Ukraine and European politicians have not been invited to attend, despite insisting they must be involved for any ceasefire to be credible.\nInstead, they will meet in Paris on Monday for an emergency summit to discuss the conflict and the continent's security.\nHere are five takeaways from Munich.\nNato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was formed in 1949 with the primary aim of blocking expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union.\nNow numbering 32 members, including several Eastern European countries, members agree that if one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.\nBut after this week the post-World War Two security architecture for Europe is no more. America is still in Nato but Europe can no longer automatically rely on the US to come to its aid.\nIn Brussels, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Nato's European members to spend much more on defence, saying they would have to provide the \"overwhelming\" share of military funding for Ukraine.\nThe US and Russia are going to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, whether Europe and Ukraine like it or not. \nThe talks in Saudi Arabia will end a three-year freeze in talking to Vladimir Putin, despite urgent warnings by Kyiv that the Russian leader is not to be trusted.\nThey follow a phone call between Donald Trump and Putin on Wednesday.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, US officials said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly said he would not accept any deal struck without his country's input, said Kyiv had not been invited to the talks.\nEurope, everyone agrees, needs to rapidly raise its defence spending if it has any hope of deterring a newly emboldened Russia. \nThe current Nato-mandated minimum of 2% of GDP is likely to rise to 3%. Russia currently spends more than twice that on defence in percentage terms.\nIn January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income on defence. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending.\nBut Europe as a whole has already overtaken the US in terms of aid to Ukraine. In total, it has allocated \u20ac70bn ($73bn; \u00a358bn) in financial and humanitarian aid as well as \u20ac62bn in military aid. This compares to \u20ac64bn in military aid from the US as well as \u20ac50bn in financial and humanitarian allocations.\nUS Vice President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on Friday was called \"ill-judged\" and \"insulting\" by many of the delegates at the Munich Security Conference. \nThey had hoped he would reassure them the US was not abandoning Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. \nBut the speech appealed to others on both sides of the Atlantic and Donald Trump  called it \"brilliant\".\nWhile the Munich conference was occupied by the geopolitical, Donald Trump announced plans to bring in a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from March.\nIt was evidence there are now very obvious rifts between Washington's positions and Europe's on several issues, from trade to dealing with Russia. \nIt is a divide that the UK is struggling to bridge, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling reporters both relationships were important and Britain was \"not choosing between the US and the EU\". \nBut the Trump team's own messaging is sometimes contradictory, rowing back on grand pronouncements the day after they have been made.",

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Brentford have been iffy but he was a huge part of why they were able to walk away with a 1-0 victory against West Ham. It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

        "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney gives you his team and manager of the week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Brentford have been iffy but he was a huge part of why they were able to walk away with a 1-0 victory against West Ham. It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

US officials said that Ukraine had also been invited - though President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has received no such invitation.\nConservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told Victoria Derbyshire it was \"too premature to make assumptions\" about the way the peace talks were heading.\n\"We all have to have very, very cold and calm heads right now, primarily because this conflict is still raging.\"\nShe said Ukrainians should be the ones to determine their future because the war was about their \"independence and sovereignty\". \nAsked if she supported President Trump's proposal that Ukraine give up territory to end the conflict, she said: \"We have to understand in more detail what they are saying, it's too easy to generalise.\n\"It's very early days in those talks, and I think right now, the United Kingdom, along with Nato allies, we must continue to be firm and solid and strong in that support we're giving.\" \nDame Priti added that as a priority, the UK needed to step up its spending on defence.  \nAppearing on the same programme, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said it was \"no surprise\" Trump and his team were taking \"a completely different\" approach by putting \"everything up for grabs\" in terms of Ukraine.\nHe described it as a \"massive wake-up call\" for European leaders to take responsibility for their own defence.  \nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Ukraine had to be \"at the front and centre\" of any peace talks.  \nHe warned that the Trump administration's moves could leave Ukraine and the rest of Europe \"at risk of future Russian aggression\". \nKarin von Hippel, former director at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said she did not think Trump would \"sell Ukraine down the river\" and European nations should \"stay calm\".\nMeanwhile, Conservative former Prime Minister Sir John Major has warned that democracy was under threat as the US steps back from its role as a world leader.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that Trump's policy of \"isolation\" was creating a power vacuum which would embolden countries like Russia and China to fill it.\nSir John said: \"Many of the gains we made over recent years, when the Soviet Union collapsed, are now being reversed and you see a very aggressive Russia again in Ukraine.\n\"And if they were to succeed with their venture in Ukraine, no doubt they'd be elsewhere before too long.\"",

        "article_text": "Toby King's second-half try gave Warrington some breathing space against Huddersfield\nBetfred Super League\nHuddersfield (6) 12\nTries: Lolohea, Greenwood Goals: Richardson 2\nWarrington (4) 20\nTries: Lindop, Ashton, King, Dufty Goals: Ratchford, Thewlis\nWarrington Wolves recovered from a sluggish first-half display to hold off Huddersfield Giants as they opened their Super League campaign with victory at John Smith's Stadium.\nSam Burgess' side looked untidy at the start and fell behind when Tui Lolohea marked his 250th career appearance with the game's opening score.\nArron Lindop's try on the stroke of half-time revitalised the visitors and they seemed to be firmly in control after Matty Ashton and Toby King both crossed the line.\nJoe Greenwood scrambled over to reduce the gap to two points, but the Giants' hopes were finally extinguished as Matt Dufty scampered on to his own kick for Warrington's fourth try.\nHuddersfield, who gave debuts to four players, opted to kick long and put the Wolves defence under pressure but, although those tactics paid off in terms of possession, the scoreboard remained blank for 25 minutes.\nWire appeared rusty, with several passes going astray and also lost their captain's challenge inside 10 minutes with a failed attempt to overturn a Giants seven-tackle set after George Williams' kick in-goal was caught by Lolohea.\nIt was the Kiwi stand-off who opened the home side's account for the season, collecting a looped pass from Zac Woolford and bursting clear to dive over on the right, with Danny Richardson adding the extras.\nHuddersfield's captain's challenge also failed after they were penalised for a steal close to their own line \u2013 but the visitors failed to take advantage, choosing to tap and run only for the move to flounder with Stefan Ratchford's knock-on.\nHowever, the visitors hit back with the final action of the first period, retrieving possession after Lolohea's pass thudded off Greenwood's chest and Lindop held off his man to score in the corner.\nAlthough Ratchford's awkward conversion attempt drifted fractionally wide, the try itself was enough to give Warrington a boost and they carried that momentum through into the second period.\nDufty fed Ashton to exploit gaps in the Huddersfield defence and put his side in front for the first time, with centre King scooting over soon afterwards to stretch the Wolves' advantage to 14-6.\nSandwiched between those tries, the Giants were unable to take advantage of Greenwood's 40-metre charge following an interception \u2013 but the second row did later narrow the deficit, bundling the ball over the line for a try confirmed by video referee Aaron Moore.\nHuddersfield's hopes of a late comeback never materialised, though, and Dufty made the points safe with five minutes remaining, following his own close-range kick through to score.\nWarrington Wolves full-back Matt Dufty told BBC 5Live Sports Extra:\n\"It was a tough-fought win. We knew Huddersfield were going to push us right to the end and I saw the gap in the line, so I had to back myself.\n\"Round one's never pretty \u2013 you'd like to think you've got all the cobwebs out in pre-season. We haven't really had a side that's played 80 minutes yet, with people in and out through trials.\n\"I thought we were a bit clunky first half, we lacked a bit of direction and we got that sorted at half-time and ran a lot more smoothly.\n\"It comes down to the effort areas, staying connected through the whole game. We had a new structure come in last year so we've already got that in place and moving forward we can build on what we had last year.\"\nHuddersfield Giants head coach Luke Robinson told BBC 5Live Sports Extra:\n\"We've had really freakish injuries, so it's been a torrid pre-season for us. Someone's got a voodoo doll with my face on it and they're prodding needles in it all the time.\n\"I'm extremely proud of each and every one of them, one to 17.

Now we can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on an issue that threatens it.\n\"Many, many leaders have talked about Europe that needs its own military - an army of Europe.\"\nThe concept of a European army has been proposed by other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron who has long backed the bloc's own military to reduce its reliance on the US.\nThe idea was quickly rebuffed by the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.\nZelensky said: \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at the table - that says a lot.\n\"The old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.\"\nAs Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears its three-year anniversary, Trump and Hegseth have both said it is unlikely that Ukraine will join Nato.\nThe US defence secretary also said a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was unrealistic. \nZelensky said he would \"not take Nato membership for Ukraine off the table\".\nTrump had a phone call with Putin last week where they discussed peace talks regarding Ukraine, apparently sidelining key allies.\nZelensky said that, as well as Ukraine, Europe \"should have a seat at the table when decisions about Europe are being made\".\nThe US president later said that he and Putin planned to meet in Saudi Arabia, and wrote on social media that the two had invited each other to their respective capitals.\nNo date has been set for Trump's visit to Moscow.\nOn Ukraine's involvement in talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Kyiv \"will of course one way or another be taking part in the negotiations\".\nGermany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said his country would never support a dictated peace.\nPoland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Europe needs its own plan on Ukraine, or \"other global players will decide about our future\".",

        "article_text": "In an old Welsh farmhouse a group of friends chatter and joke while tucking into a lunch of home-made soup and sourdough. \nBut behind this convivial scene a \"gnarly and unpleasant\" legal battle is underway.\nLast year, Brithdir Mawr - an 80-acre (32-hectare) farm in Newport, Pembrokeshire, that has been home to an off-grid community for the past 30 years - was sold to a new owner who plans to turn it into a retreat centre.\nThe community were issued with an eviction notice and some members left by the 31 December deadline, but others refused and are determined to remain. \nWill Cooke, who has lived with the community for four-and-a half years, said he hoped the adults who remained living on the site could come to an arrangement with the new owner that would work for all.\n\"There are no bad people in this situation, there are just many, many people trying their hardest to do the right thing and we've got into a glitch with each other,\" he said.\n\"I want us all to sit down with each other and try and straighten it out.\"\nBrithdir Mawr was established in 1993 by Julian Orbach with his then wife Emma and was originally part of a site of 160 acres (64 hectares).\nAfter the couple separated the site was split into two, with Emma establishing the neighbouring Tir Ysbrydol [Welsh for spiritual house] community and Mr Orbach remaining at Brithdir Mawr.\nIn 2002, he moved out but remained Brithdir Mawr's landlord. \nWhen Mr Orbach decided to sell, he said he \"very much\" wanted the community to continue and it was given first refusal to purchase the site. \nBut after the community's 10-year bid to raise the \u00a31m for the purchase, he sold the site last year to Rachel May, who is described as a shadow work and mindfulness coach, doula [offering help and support] and soul guide.\nShe has not responded to requests to be interviewed.\n\"We are aware that Rachel is our new owner, we are very aware of the fact that she's spent a large amount of money to do this, but the way in which she is wanting to bring about this process of change is completely out of alignment with who we are as a community,\" said Will.\n\"We've invited Rachel to come and visit with us several times, to come and negotiate with us to find a way forward that works for everyone.\" \nWill was a teacher and later worked for Extinction Rebellion UK before moving in with the community. \n\"I was expecting to spend two weeks here and I never left,\" he said. \n\"It's a really good fit for me, I get on really well here and feel like I'm valued and appreciated for who I am.\"\nThe community's members are dedicated to sustainable living. They keep goats - primarily to make cheese and occasionally for meat - as well as chickens, grow their own vegetables and manage the site's woodland.\nThe building runs off hydropower and a tiny wind turbine and is heated by a log burner. \nThey host weekly Welsh language classes, run workshops, open days and volunteer weeks to demonstrate their way of life.\nMany in the community have jobs away from the farm, they eat communally five times a week and, before the community's families left ahead of the eviction notice, the children were home-schooled.\nWill and the other members each pay rent as well as their contribution to \"food club\", bills, and a savings pot for expenses such as building repairs. \nWith no-one in charge, decisions are made collaboratively and their shared values include inclusivity, gratitude and valuing learning and culture. \nDoes living in this way come with the occasional conflict?\n\"There absolutely are difficulties at times,\" admitted Will.\n\"Occasionally conflicts happen... but there are far fewer than there are beautiful times.\"\nHe said the community tried to take blame out of conflict.\n\"A conflict for me is when we find a glitch in the way in which we're working, no-one's at fault,\" he said.\nHe said \"detangling\" conflicts when there was no-one in charge was \"very deep and intense work and often very painful, but by the end of it we find ourselves stronger, more beautiful, able to act with each other in a more beautiful way\".\nRosie Gilam, who grew up in nearby Cardigan, is Will's partner and spends about three days a week with him at Brithdir Mawr.\nShe has been visiting the community since she was a child and previously lived in communities in Cornwall. \n\"A major wonderful thing about being human is to accept others for what they are, understand they've got their own needs which might not intersect completely with your needs, and to come to a place where you're accepting of your differences and find a way to work together,\" she said.\n\"I think that is so needed on the planet at the moment.\" \nLike Will, she insisted \"nobody's to blame\" for the community's current predicament. \nShe said the situation was an example of \"broken systems\" which meant \"tenants don't have rights, a family can be turfed out of its home with little notice, and that people generally don't have affordable access to land\". \nShe hopes media attention on Brithdir Mawr will start a conversation about land rights and be \"one step towards systemic change\". \n\"So for example, there might be community right to buy, which means that a community like this in the future would have the right to buy an asset,\" she said.  \nAndromeda Gervasio, who is from Portugal, moved to the UK 12 years ago, and moved to Brithdir Mawr last summer after feeling burnt out with city life, \"craving a different lifestyle\" and being drawn to \"intentional community\".\n\"The water is the purest water I've ever drank, and the food is the best food I've ever eaten,\" they said.\n\"People are here not just because, there's a bigger purpose of really living together and sharing the work that it is to live and to live in a place like this... it's pretty incredible.\"\nThey said they cherished being accepted in the countryside. \n\"Being a queer person in the rural landscape has always been something that I was generally scared about... and then actually discovering it and feeling incredibly safe here, I've been so grateful... and I think that I owe lots to Brithdir in that regard,\" they said.\nLike the rest of their community, Andromeda insisted they did not feel animosity towards the new owner. \n\"We're not up against a particular person but a system and a normalised way of going about things,\" they said.\n\"Just because someone has the legal backing to do something, it doesn't necessarily make it okay or how the world should be.\n\"We have a history of things that were within legal bounds not corresponding to what is morally OK to do... [denying] women's rights, slavery and queer witch hunts were all legal at some point.\"\nFor now, what will happen next for the community is uncertain.  \n\"Essentially I feel really, really sad about it,\" said Rosie. \nShe lives in hope of all parties sitting down together and looking for a solution \"with an open heart\". \nWill is confident a resolution can be found.\n\"I don't know exactly what that would look like and that's OK,\" he said. \n\"This complexity and this difficulty feels very difficult, feels gnarly and unpleasant, but also I truly believe that something very special is happening.\n\"I look forward to this process continuing and resolving in a way that works for everyone in the near future.\"",

But now we are living our dream,\" Chris says.\nDespite working \"every hour under the sun\" \u2013 Chris as a personal trainer and Tamira as a swimming teacher - they could not keep up with the cost of living in the UK.\n\"We went down to one car, we got rid of Sky TV, we didn't go on holiday but the bills kept going up and up,\" says Tamira.\n\"We only ate together as a family once a month because we didn't get time. We were just working to make ends meet.\"\nIt was during Covid that they first talked about selling up and travelling the world.\n\"We had a chance to breathe and we realised we didn't want to go back to the life we were living,\" Chris says.\nThe couple put their house up for sale in 2022 but it took longer to sell than they anticipated and they nearly backed out of the plan. When it finally sold in May 2023, they drove straight to Heathrow.\n\"Our last night in the house, we were all on the floor because we had sold all our furniture,\" says Chris. \n\"We didn't have the money to book our flights until we got the cash from the house, so we went to a hotel near Heathrow and booked flights to Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia].\n\"It was a huge risk. We thought it might not work and we might want to go home, but we've never looked back.\"\n\nChris taught himself videography before they left so he could document their travels on social media, which has turned into their biggest source of income.\n\"We were already making videos about family life, but we didn't have a huge amount of followers,\" the 36-year-old explains. \"We had 7,000 subscribers on YouTube but now we have 100,000, and we had about 12,000 on TikTok where as now we have 250,000.\"\nAfter exploring Malaysia, they went to Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and Qatar.\nIt was during their trip to China that their social media \"blew up\" and the family \"accidentally became famous\" in the country.\nOne video they made about their drinks being dropped off by a drone received eight million views on TikTok.\nThey also saw a huge growth on Chinese social media platforms, where they have over one million followers and their videos reach tens of millions of views.\nThe couple say the trip has been \"incredible\", but there have inevitably been tough times.\nTamira got dengue fever in Thailand, their family credit card got swallowed by a machine in Vietnam and all five of them got a sickness bug while staying in a hostel in the Philippines.\n\"Another difficult time was when we got lost in China. We were walking round with all our possessions in the early hours of the morning and our phone maps didn't work. But we eventually found our hotel and we can laugh about it now,\" Tamira says.\nThey have based themselves on the Malaysian island of Penang for the last few months, where their daughters, who are home schooled by Tamira, are \"thriving\".\n\"They are learning about different cultures, currencies, languages and how to get around,\" Chris says.\n\"All three of them have always been 110% on board with this idea, but if they ever changed their minds and wanted to go home, we would listen to them.\n\"They have grown in confidence so much and they make friends wherever they go. There are a lot of digital nomad families travelling round, who are working remotely.\"\nThe Hutchinsons say they have got the next five years planned out, with trips to Dubai, Australia, India, Sri Lanka and Cambodia on the cards this year.\nThey might also go back to the UK briefly, but they have no plans at the moment to return permanently, because their \"quality of life is so much better now\".\nThe couple receive lots of messages asking for advice and say they hope to inspire other parents.\n\"It's not flowers all the time but if you're a person who enjoys a challenge and enjoys spending time with your family, go for it.

        "article_text": "With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.\nAll the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.\nThe bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.\nGoing back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.\nIt was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.\n\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.\nBut for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.\n\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.\nAnother farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.\n\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.\nAlso known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThey are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.\nStanding at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.\nBut with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.\n\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.\nIn the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.\nThis decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.\n\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.\nAround Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. \nConservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.\nDozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.\n\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.\nMr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.\nFarmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.\n\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.\n\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.\nSarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.\nCranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.\n\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.\nTheir exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.\nBut crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.\n\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.\nThey attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.\nScientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.\nAny destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.\nTheir monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.\n\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.\nThis is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.\nAnd in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.\nPresident Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.\nThe ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.\nNature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".\nFor Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.\n\"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,\" he said.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.\nRakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.\n\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.\nWhen Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.\n\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.\nHer teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.\nFor a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.\nA middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.\nThere was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.\nHowever, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.\nHe invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.\nWhen they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"\nCompetition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.\nOver time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.\nThey won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.\nRakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.\nThey missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.\nSimran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.\nBut in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.\nBut the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.\nSimran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.\n\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.\nSimran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.\nTheir first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.\n\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.\nBut by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.\nRiding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.\nBut Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.\nAlthough guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.\n\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.\nBoth Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.\nDespite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.\nRakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"\nThe BBC Indian Sportswoman Of The Year (ISWOTY) Award is back with its fifth edition to celebrate and honour the remarkable achievements of women athletes in India. Find out about the nominees - the winner will be announced on 17 February.",

        "article_text": "For 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?\nIn the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.\nBut one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.\nThis would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).\nThough EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.\nIn March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.\nDespite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.\n\"In those days, if a theme tune was popular, you'd often release it as a single. So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.\n\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.\n\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"\nAnother key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.\nAfter a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role. Anita Dobson took on the character at the last minute.\nActor and stuntman Derek Martin, who joined the soap 15 years later as Charlie Slater, explains he was also up for the role of Den.\n\"Leslie got it, and he was very good, he was the ladies' man, and I was more the hard man,\" the 91-year-old actor says.\nThis pairing of Angie and Den proved popular with the public - and the Christmas Day 1986 episode that sees Den serve Angie divorce papers remains the only scripted programme to have been watched by more than 30 million people in the UK, according to Barb figures.\nThe first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, with 17 million people watching - making it the second most-watched episode on the BBC that week behind The Two Ronnies. \nThis compared with the 18 million who watched the same week's Coronation Street.\nThe episode started with a kick, as Den broke down a door to find the nearly dead body of Reg Cox (played by Johnnie Clayton) - and ended with a punch, as suspect number one in the attack, Nick Cotton (John Altman), put his fist through the glass of the Queen Vic doors.\nThough the press was quick to set up a rivalry between EastEnders and Coronation Street, the cast had their eye on another ITV soap.\nActor Adam Woodyat, who played Ian Beale in that first episode, says: \"We were going out at the same time as Emmerdale Farm at 7pm. It felt like Emmerdale Farm gave us an absolute kicking in the ratings until they shifted us to half past seven.\"\nNewspapers of the time suggested reactions were mixed. A Sunday People poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents didn't like the first episode, with complaints over \"coarse\" and \"bawdy\" dialogue.\nThe Guardian, however, was more measured, with their critic Hugh Hebert predicting it would \"probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right\".\nThe show would prove itself earlier than that. On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week. This coincided with the show's first blockbuster storyline that saw Michelle (played by Susan Tully) become pregnant by a mystery man, eventually revealed to be Den Watts.\n\"After the reveal of Den and Michelle,\" says Woodyat, \"that's when we started to realise we might have something here.\"",

How EastEnders was made, from 'doof doofs' to Angie and Den21 hours agoSamuel Spencer & Shola LeeBBC NewsBBCFor 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?In the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.But one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.This would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).The Albert Square set under construction \u2013 and how the setting of the show, called East 8 at the time, was described to a focus groupThough EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.In March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.Despite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.The cast at a table read in November 1984.

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodiverse people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

        "article_text": "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"\nIf you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.\nContestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.\nIn Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.\nForced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules. \nBlind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky. \nA second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.\n\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February. \n\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"\nYet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.\n\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.\n\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"\nThe magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.\nGonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".\n\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.\nThe Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.\nSeeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.\n\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.\n\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"\nAlongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.\nA curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media. \nA previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.\nAfter Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\". \nWhen asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".\nLike Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.\nA heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints. \nDespite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.\n\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"\nTemptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.\nTake Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.\nSo is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain? \nWhen I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.\n\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.\nIn the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.\nWhen I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.\nMontoya received particular support after his beach escapade. \n\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.\nLooking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month. \nGonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\"",

        "article_text": "Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents.\nThe choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; \u00a3105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad.\n\"I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,\" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. \"But I've ended up with a bounty!\"\nChloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago.\nIn 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels.\nHer protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the caf\u00e9 in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest.\nHong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her \u2013 in which she is aged 11.\n\"It freaked me out at first,\" she says, but then she fired back a public response.\n\"I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them.\"\nChloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997.\n\"Politics were never in my life before\u2026 so I went to the first protest with curiosity,\" she said.\nShe saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck.\n\"I was so shocked,\" she says. \"That moment actually changed how I looked at the world.\"\nGrowing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms \u2013 she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about \"what we like and don't like\" and  \"could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like\".\nBut the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge.\n\"I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],\" she says. But when things started to get \"really crazy\",  she browbeat her parents into coming with her.\nAt the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the \"raw experience\", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV.\nAfter months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. Suddenly, most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies \u2013 were gone.\nSymbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail.\nIn response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown.\nAt first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around.\nUnable to afford international student fees of more than \u00a320,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO.\nWhen China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians.

He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK.\nBut more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster.\nIn the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: \"We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK.\" \nBut she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers.\n\"We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China.\"\nDoes she feel scared on the streets in London?

I thought I just did enough but no excuses,\" said Catterall.\nBarboza Jr extended his unbeaten record to 32 pro wins \nEurope's largest indoor arena \u2013 with a capacity of 23,500 - was around a third full as a boisterous crowd repeatedly chanted 'Chorley' to welcome Lancastrian Catterall to the ring.\nQuite fittingly, he made his entrance to the song 'I just can't wait to be king' from the Lion King.\nCatterall, who started boxing aged 11 and turned pro in 2012, is a reserved family man, yet there has been a swagger and spring in his step throughout fight week. \nBarboza, though, had won all 31 of his pro fights and arrived in the UK full of confidence on the back of a career-best win over Jose Ramirez in November.\nNeither fighter was willing to overcommit early on and Catterall edged the first two rounds with the cleaner work. The Californian responded well, cutting off the ring and landing jabs and good body shots.\nA terrific counter-puncher, southpaw Catterall's approach, while appreciated by purists, does not always lend to the most entertaining of styles.\nHe landed a great two-punch combination in the sixth round, before his rival returned the favour with a flush right.\nCatterall was warned for a low blow in the seventh and, as the round drew to a close, his legs dipped after a right from Barboza.\nThe Catterall faithful turned the volume up a notch when the American hit the canvas in the 11th. He instantly shot up to his feet and protested a slip, with replays showing he fell over Catterall's trailing leg as a jab landed.\nBarboza and Catterall both celebrated at the final bell as pundits and ringside reporters shrugged their shoulders and compared contrasting scorecards with the decision too close to call.\nA frustrated Catterall was consoled by trainer Jamie Moore\n\nThe loss was disappointing for Catterall, who was enjoying a golden period in his career. In the past 15 months, he had beaten former champions Taylor, Jorge Linares and Regis Prograis.\nBut he came up against an undefeated foe who was motivated by his own pursuit for world honours.\n\"I want to see him go and fight for the world title, hopefully he beats Teofimo,\" added Catterall. \"It's straight back to the gym for me.\"\nCatterall missed out on becoming England's first male undisputed champion in the four-belt era when he lost to Taylor three years ago in Glasgow. Most ringside observers felt he should have been awarded the decision against the Scot.\nIf he does not ever win a world title, that loss \u2013 and the injustice of it \u2013 may unfortunately be what 'El Gato' will be most remembered for.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

It's not right.\"\nAs part of an effort organizers dubbed #TeslaTakeover, clutches of protesters across the country gathered outside the company's showrooms, having largely planned when to meet and where on the social media platform Bluesky, an upstart competitor to Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.\nIn some places, those protests barely numbered a dozen, with people in Washington DC, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Lyndhurst, Ohio, stamping their feet to stay warm amid snow and cold weather. Some held signs that read \"Say no to Doge\" and \"Deport Musk\".\nThe protest in Berkeley - a top California city for electric car ownership - numbered 200.\nAs part of his White House-backed effort called Doge, for Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has been sending teams into government agencies to comb through data and pushing for massive spending cuts as well as \"clawbacks\" of money already spent. \nPresident Donald Trump, who received an historic amount of campaign donations from Musk, is on the same page, freezing hiring as well as laying off thousands of federal employees.\nMusk says he has uncovered wasteful spending and his work is aimed at making the government operate more smoothly. But to many, he is stopping the government from functioning while making decisions that should be left to elected leaders and accessing private information.\n\"It's just really grinding on the mind,\"  said Dale Koistinen. \"I'm 84 years old. This is unbelievable. This is a takeover of our government.\"\nAlong with X, Musk also is the primary owner SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. But it is Tesla he is most known for and Tesla is where people unhappy with his Doge work are taking out their anger.\nFor days, concerned Americans have been asking fellow citizens to dump their Tesla stock and sell their Tesla vehicles.\nSinger-songwriter Sheryl Crow posted a video to Instagram that showed her Tesla being towed away.\n\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,\" she wrote in the caption. \"So long Tesla.\"\nCrow added that she was donating proceeds from the car's sale to National Public Radio in the U.S., a frequent target of Musk's ire.\nTesla stock surged following Donald Trump's election in November. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election effort, and hit the trail on Trump's behalf in the final days of the campaign.\nBut after touching an all-time high in December, the company's shares have shed 30% of their value with a pronounced selloff since Trump was inaugurated last month.\nSaturday's protests were promoted by prominent disinformation researcher Joan Donovan and the actor Alex Winter, who played Bill in the 80s movie \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.\" \nTeah Jackson, though, noticed the Berkeley protest during an outing with her girlfriend, and stopped to show her support.\n\"It's hopeful,\" Jackson told the BBC. \"It's an acknowledgement that people aren't going to go down without a fight and that they're going to continue to push for what they believe in.\"",

My 9 to 5,\" he said, adding he would \"absolutely not\" give up.\nThe value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about \u00a3620m, Mr Howells said \"it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this\" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies. \nMr Howells, from Newport, claimed his ex-partner mistakenly threw out the hard drive, containing 8,000 bitcoins, in 2013, with it ending up in a tip owned by Newport City Council. \nLast month, a High Court judge threw out his efforts to access the landfill or get \u00a3495m in compensation, saying there were no \"reasonable grounds\" for bringing the claim and \"no realistic prospect\" of succeeding at a full trial.\nHe is now planning a case \u2013 representing himself using artificial intelligence to support his claim \u2013 at the Court of Appeal. He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year. \nNewport council said it was making no further comment on the matter.\nMr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value.\nHe has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive \u2013 about the size of a mobile phone \u2013 containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013. As its value soared, he organised a team of experts to attempt to locate and recover it.\nHe repeatedly asked permission from the council for access to the site, offering it a share of the missing Bitcoin if it was successfully recovered.\nAfter Mr Howells launched legal proceedings, the council applied for a High Court hearing to ask a judge to dismiss the claim before going to trial \u2013 which the judge did last month.\nThe council argued its environmental permits would forbid any attempt to excavate the site for the search and previously said such work \"would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area\".\nUnwilling to give up, Mr Howells now believes he has two options open to him to retrieve the digital wallet \u2013 launch a case at the Court of Appeal, or work with investors to try to buy the landfill site from the council, after it announced the site is \"coming to the end of its life\" and it plans to close it within the next two years.\nMr Howells told BBC News he was pleased with the work his legal team had done in the High Court trial, but that he would now be representing himself in a case filed with the Court of Appeal \u2013 using an \"artificial intelligence agent\" to assist his claim.\nHe described AI as \"an absolutely amazing technology\" that had helped him better understand court processes and the law, and that he believed he had about seven \"solid grounds in law\" for his case, which he hopes to be able to present in-person to the Court of Appeal.\nOne of the arguments in his case will centre on the council's plans to close the site, something he argued should have been revealed during the High Court trial.\n\"That is material information that should have been made [at the trial] \u2013 the judge should have been aware of that, as well as myself,\" he said.\nMr Howells also said buying and fully excavating the site would save the council what he argued were significant maintenance costs once the site closes.\n\"Every single piece would be extracted or recycled, and at the end of the process we would have a hard drive in our hands - and we would also have an empty landfill,\" he said.\nIn the High Court trial, the council also argued that the hard drive became its property as soon as it entered the landfill site, but Mr Howells said this failed to take into account the fact it was his ex-partner who threw it out.\n\"It was taken without my permission or consent,\" he said.\nMr Howells said he was also exploring the option of buying the site from the council, adding he had \"preliminary agreements\" with investors \u2013 including those in the Middle East and the United States \u2013 who could make funding available if he had permission to buy the site.\n\"They're not just going to put millions of quid in my back pocket... but if the council show a willingness to sell the site, then the funding will be available,\" he said.\nThe council has made no indication it is interested in selling the site and, as part of its closure, has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.\nHaving spent many years pursuing it, including opening legal cases, Mr Howells said he was certain the hard drive remained on the landfill, which holds more than 1.4 million tonnes of waste.\nHe said he had done his \"due diligence and research\", having spoken to a site manager at the landfill.\n\"Anything that was put into that site is still there. So, where else could it be?\"\nAsked if he would ever give up his mission to retrieve it, he said: \"Absolutely not. This is like the final battle in Braveheart.\"\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.\nBitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit. \nSatoshis are named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 believed to be a pseudonym \u2013 who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.\nThose investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a \"very small\" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.\nBitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being \"very quickly enamoured with it\", Mr Bambrough said.\nPrices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when \"stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely\".\n\"A lot of people got very rich, but a lot of people also lost money,\" Mr Bambrough said.\nThe cryptocurrency also saw rapid increases in late 2024, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the US general election, with his administration being seen as far friendlier towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.\n\"A lot of people in the crypto and Bitcoin worlds say the price has gone up so much in such a short amount of time, they claim it could go higher and higher,\" Mr Bambrough said.\n\"So I can understand why James [Howells] is keen to find his Bitcoin.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMan City's Egyptian Prince - Lineker on Marmoush\nThere is not much Erling Haaland has failed to do when it comes to scoring goals since he joined Manchester City.\nFifty-two overall in his first season, including 36 in the Premier League, the most anyone has scored in a single campaign.\nThirty-eight in his second, despite being injured for almost two months, and 27 so far this term.\nThat incredible haul has secured the Norwegian two Golden Boots and an incredible 11 hat-tricks. \nYet none of those trebles came quicker than the 13 minutes and 54 seconds Omar Marmoush took to get his first City hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Newcastle.\nAfter four games without scoring since his \u00a359m winter transfer window move from German side Eintracht Frankfurt, it was an impressive and well-timed surge in form given City go to Real Madrid for their crucial Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday with a one-goal deficit to overcome after a 3-2 loss at home. \nIt was also the first time any City player other than Haaland had scored three times in a game since Phil Foden did it at Brentford just over a year ago.\nAnd that is the point.\nOne of the notable features of the terrible mid-season run of one win in 13 games, which wrecked any chance City had of extending their record run of four successive titles - and was mainly responsible for them ending up having to face Real Madrid so early in the Champions League - was the fact hardly anyone picked up the slack when Haaland's form dipped.\nJosko Gvardiol, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva all scored two goals in that time.

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena. \nKay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".\nOne heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".\nAnother had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.\nThe woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".\nBBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".\nThe incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.\nWith this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.\nLarry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".\n\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.\n\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"\nLast year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".\nWhen discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.\n\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply. \n\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"\nDean recalls his shocked response. \n\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" Dean tells the BBC.\nThe Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.\n\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!\n\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"\nHis second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.\nArenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.\n\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.\nHe says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.\n\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"\nAnother British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".\nDean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.\nBut, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.\nAbi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.\nCrucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.\n\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.\n\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\" \nNew comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as an MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.\nFor Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.\n\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.\n\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!\n\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"\nClarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.\n\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"\nThe other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.\n\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"\nShe's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.\n\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"\nHer new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.\nDuring these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".\nWelsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.\nIt's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant. \nHe sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.\n\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.\n\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"\nStag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.\nHilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.\n\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"\n\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.\n\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"\nHe will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certian \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.\nBut it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".\n\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"\nNine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".\nAnd the one that does, \"might have had a bad day, drank too much or they might just be an [idiot]!\n\"I think it's something within people, we like a bit of drama.\"",

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support.

        "article_text": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.",

The warning came after Hamas said it was postponing the releases in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire. \nPresident Trump said the ceasefire should be scrapped if Hamas did not release all the hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday.\nSince the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 766 prisoners.\nDuring the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages should be freed in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel.\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.\nMore than 48,230 people have been killed by the Israel offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThere are 73 hostages taken on 7 October who are still being held in Gaza.

Intense efforts by mediators US, Egypt and Qatar have managed to stop it from collapsing.\nIsrael has been especially infuriated by the staged way hostages have been released - publicly displayed on platforms alongside gunmen and in front of crowds of spectators, before being handed over to the Red Cross in chaotic scenes.\nFor its part, Hamas has accused Israel of preventing what the group says are the amount of tents and aid lorries required to be let into Gaza under the terms of the ceasefire. Israel denies this.\nMeanwhile the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published video of what it said was a rocket fired at Israel from Gaza on Thursday. It said the rocket failed and landed inside Gaza. A source in the Hamas-run police said the rocket was an unexploded Israeli ordinance that had fired into the air while it was being moved away, Reuters news agency reported. \nWest Bank-based Palestinian news agency Wafa said a 14-year-old boy, Hammoudeh Alaa Saud, was killed the same day by what it said was Israeli ordnance which blew up in Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp.\n",

        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nIt had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".\nVance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".\nThe Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.\nBut Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.\nHe alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.\n\n\nMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".\nVance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.\nHe raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.\nThe safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.\nBut Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.\nVance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.\nIn response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".\nNine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIn the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties.\n\"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. \"There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, later shared parts of his speech on X, praising it as \"excellent\". The two reportedly met afterwards, according to German public broadcaster ZDF.\nIn his own speech, Pistorius directly addressed Vance, saying: \"Democracy was called into question by the US vice-president for the whole of Europe.\n\"He speaks of the annihilation of democracy,\" Pistorius continued. \"And if I have understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes... that is not acceptable.\"\nVance also made reference to the presidential election in Romania, which was annulled in December after declassified documents suggested it had been targeted by Russian state interference.\nVance told the conference: \"If your democracy can be destroyed with a few $100,000 of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with.\"\nRomanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said his country remains \"a defender of the democratic values that Europe shares with the USA\". \n\"All RO [Romanian] authorities are committed to organising free and fair elections by empowering citizens and guaranteeing the freedom to vote,\" he wrote on X.\nVance later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the conference, which has otherwise mainly focussed on Russia's full-scale invasion.\nZelensky said during the meeting that more work was needed on planning to end the fighting, while Vance said the pair shared a \"fruitful\" conversation.\nTrump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich, but Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the summit.",

She alleged that both men assaulted her in 2000 after an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty.\nJay-Z strongly denied the allegations, claiming that his attorney had been sent \"blackmail\" in an attempt to force a settlement. He said the attempt had the \"opposite effect\" and instead motivated him to publicly challenge the accusations.\nIn December, Jane Doe gave an interview that raised questions about her credibility. She admitted that \"not all the facts are clear\" and stated, \"I have made some mistakes. I may have made a mistake in identifying.\"\nLast month, Jay-Z formally requested the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing inconsistencies in the accuser's account. The request was approved by United States District Judge Analisa Torres, leading to the lawsuit's dismissal.\nWhile Jay-Z is no longer facing legal action in this case, Mr Combs continues to battle over three dozen civil suits.\nIn response to Friday's dismissal, Mr Combs' legal team issued a statement declaring his innocence.\n\"For months, we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity, pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit.

        "article_text": "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the latest move in a row between the Trump administration and career US attorneys. \nSeven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case. \nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News on Friday that it was her understanding that the case against Adams would be \"dismissed today\". \nAdams was indicted last year on fraud and bribery charges. He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe request to drop the charges will require approval by a judge.\nEarlier in the week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove - Bondi's second-in-command - ordered the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office to end the case.\nBove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. \nThe motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case \"would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies\".\nBut several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.   \nSassoon resigned from her post on Thursday and was followed by six of her colleagues.\nShe said dropping the case would set a \"breathtaking and dangerous precedent\".\nThe latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for \"using prosecutorial power\" to influence elected officials.\n\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\nIn a letter accepting Sassoon's resignation, Bove said his office would be investigating the attorney, claiming she had \"lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice\". \nIn a statement, Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle defended the decision to dismiss the charges, saying it showed \"that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\".\nMr Mizelle said that prosecutors who refuse direct orders \"have no place\" in the department.\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. \nIn Sassoon's resignation letter, she also said  Adams' lawyers had met justice department officials and asked for a \"quid pro quo\", saying the New York City mayor could help enforce Trump's immigration policies if the case against him was dismissed.\nBut Adams denied that was the case. \n\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered - nor did anyone offer on my behalf - any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\nAdams, a Democrat, has accused investigators of pursuing a politically motivated case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\nThe New York mayor has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he won the White House. He flew to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida days before the Republican president took office. \nAfter a meeting with US border tsar Tom Homan on Thursday, Adams said he would agree to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to re-establish an office at the city's Rikers Island jail. \nTrump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the case against Adams. \nBut Bove's letter described his instructions to drop the case as \"direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\".\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.\nWhile she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was \"consulting with other leaders in government at this time\". \n\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious,\" she said. \"But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction.\"",

He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women.

And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. \"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. \"The court documents make for grim reading.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.Getty ImagesA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to criminalise marital rapeThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".",

        "article_text": "The NHS will automatically test patients for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C unless they opt out at almost 90 Accident and Emergency (A&E) units in England, the BBC can reveal. \nThe government is rolling out a \u00a327m expansion of the scheme to 30 new hospitals, saying it could lead to an extra 1,900 people receiving earlier care for HIV each year.\nNHS England data showed a 40% rise in the detection of blood-borne infections after the last Conservative government began piloting the scheme in November 2023.\nNHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the \"expansion of this revolutionary opt-out testing\" will lead to the early detection of \"thousands more cases of HIV and Hepatitis B and C\".\nThe announcement means the scheme will be available in nearly all areas of England. \nIt is designed to catch cases of blood-borne viruses in people who would not usually get tested at a sexual health clinic.\nNHS England data shows opt-out testing has caught 7,300 cases of newly-diagnosed blood-borne viruses, including more than 1,000 cases of HIV, 4,600 of Hepatitis B and 1,600 of Hepatitis C.\nPreviously expanding the scheme to 59 hospitals led to a 43% surge in detected infections over 10 months compared to the same time period two years earlier.\nHIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus - the immunodeficiency is the weakening of the immune system by the virus. If untreated, it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis C cause inflammation of the liver and come from viral infections, according to the NHS. Both can be contracted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.  \nOpt-out testing for blood-borne viruses has been seen by health officials and ministers as a resounding success for the NHS, which has not yet released the names of the latest hospitals added to the scheme.\nThe BBC understands health leaders hope to expand opt-out testing to detect more diseases in the future. \nSean Connaughton, from London, told the BBC he would \"have been dead\" had it not been for the opt-out testing. \nHe is one of the hundreds of people to discover they were living with HIV after being diagnosed through the scheme.\nHe attended hospital in October 2023 after suffering from seizures and losing 20kg (44lbs) through repeated sickness.\n\"Unless I had gone to A&E and I had done that test, my diagnosis would never have been known,\" Mr Connaughton said.\nWithout a diagnosis, doctors told him \"some of the other infections I had would have gone into my spine and into my brain\", he told the BBC.\n\"Two days prior to being admitted, I'd had a seizure in the bathroom and smashed my head into the basin and passed out, so the body was already breaking at that point. \n\"I wouldn't have survived, I don't think, another couple of weeks, if I hadn't been tested.\"\nRichard Angell, the chief executive of sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said opt-out testing was a \"win-win for everyone\".\n\"The benefit of opt-out testing is that you can get a test to people that would otherwise never come forward for a HIV test,\" Mr Angell said.\nHe added \"that means a transformation for the individual\" who can begin to take medication, which \"means the virus is no longer attacking their immune system and they can't pass it on if they're having sex or having a baby\".\nMr Angell said early testing also makes \"good money sense for the NHS\" as it allows early treatment, which stops HIV progressing, preventing severe illness, emergency visits and more costly treatments.\nThe testing forms part of a pledge by Sir Keir Starmer to eliminate new transmissions of HIV by 2030.\nEarlier this week, Sir Keir became the first sitting prime minister to publicly take an HIV test.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.\nSea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.\nBut as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.\nThis latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.\nOver the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).\nThis breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.\nArctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.\nThe decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.\nBut until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.\nSince then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.\n\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.\n\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"\nAntarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.\nBut warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.\nThe Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.\n\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"\nAntarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.\nAt the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.\nBut current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.\nThis is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.\nAs well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.\n\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.\nIn recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.\nThis \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.\nThis very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.\nBut, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.\nThe Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.\nDeclining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.\nPolar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.\n\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.\nSea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.\n\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nKendrick Lamar's most famous lyric was the heard around the world at last weekend's Super Bowl.\nAn estimated 127 million viewers saw the rapper flash a devious smile to the camera as he delivered the line - a withering takedown of bitter rival Drake.\nTaken from Grammy-winning track Not Like Us, it refers to accusations that the Canadian star had relationships with underage women - something he's denied.\nBut as 70,000 fans inside New Orlean's Caesars Superdome belted it out with him, it felt like Kendrick's winning play in the pair's long-running beef. \nIt's been public, personal and petty, but Kendrick has implied that he's waging a much wider war. \nNot just against Drake, but against what he represents.\n\"Drake is the face of the hip-hop scene as it is,\" says Margs, a London rapper who hosts rap battles on his channel Pen Game. \nThe Canadian is a huge commercial success - the most streamed artist of the 2010s, 143 million Instagram followers and a fixture on party playlists and nightclub set lists.\nHis style is melodic and accessible. He sings. \nIn other words, he's as much a pop star as he is a rapper. And where Drake goes, others follow.\n\"A lot of people see him as being responsible for the watering down of the product,\" says Margs.\n\"There's people that like the commercial side of music that just want to dance and enjoy themselves and it have no substance to it. \n\"And then there's the other side which is deep-rooted in the hip-hop culture.\"\nIt's a culture Kendrick wants to defend and celebrate.\nSpeaking before the Super Bowl show, he said the \"grit\" had gone from the genre. \n\"When people talk about rap, the conversations I'm hearing, they think it's just rapping, it's not an actual art form,\" he said.\nKendrick also took issue with rap being \"minimised to a catchy song or verse\", and said his feud with Drake actually came \"more from a space of more people putting rap to the back\".\n\"You didn't see that grit, you didn't see that bite any more. So I always took that into consideration with my music,\" he said.\nNot everyone agrees that a more mainstream-friendly version of rap makes Drake less credible.\nHis one-time rival Common recently defended him against the \"pop star\" label - saying that \"he's still an MC\" even though his songs are popular.\nKendrick, though, is passionate about rap as an artform, and said the success of Not Like Us and being chosen as the first solo hip-hop artist to front the halftime show \"meant everything\".\n\"To represent it on this type of stage is just everything that I've worked for and everything I believe in for the culture, I live and die by it,\" he said.\nHip-hop, a genre which has been around for 50 years, has a long history of protest.\nMargs says \"a lot of that has been lost\" when comparing current trends with the genre's origins.\n\"They cared about the message and what it stands for because hip-hop was something that was heavily politicised,\" he says.\n\"People used to use their voices in hip-hop to protest and get their messages out.\"\nThe political messaging in Kendrick's halftime show came from the start when actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as US government icon Uncle Sam, introduced the rapper.\nFrom there, it included references to the black power movement, imagery of a divided United States and, just before the finale, the line: \"This is bigger than the music.\"\nIt's a time of political change in the US following the re-election of Donald Trump, who was at the Super Bowl.\n\"There's no better time for people to stand on business and talk about things that matter,\" Margs says. \nKendrick - and his beef with Drake - also hark back to the origins of hip-hop in another way. \nHe's said he sees rap as a sport - and battle raps were his inspiration for the back-and-forth with Drake.\nThese face-offs - as seen in the Eminem film 8Mile - are where artists compete live, swapping disses and trying to spit the best bars to take home the prize.\nIt's rap in its purest form - substance over style and a focus on lyricism.\nKendrick said it's always been that way for him, and it's a vital part of finding the \"grit\" and \"bite\" he feels is missing.\n\"I still watch battle raps, this has always been the core definition of who I am and it's been this way since day one,\" he said.\nMargs thinks Kendrick's success will shine a light on battle rap, but he acknowledges emerging rappers are now finding new ways to cut their teeth. \nAmong them is Layyah, who was the first female rapper to win The Rap Game UK.\nShe's Team Kendrick, but doesn't plan on following his example on battle rap. \nLayyah says rap artists she looks up to like Central Cee are \"definitely not battle rappers\" but have found success and respect through other routes. \n\"We have so many platforms,\" she says. \"It's more like who can make a great song and then who can make the best routine to it.\n\"If that goes viral then it's a great song, you don't really have to do the battle raps.\"\nMargs thinks that's \"taken away from the art form a little bit\".\n\"You can win a battle on social media just through popularity or being funny... whereas with battle rap it's all about your lyrics and your skill.\"\nAs for Kendrick's beef with Drake, it's stayed quiet since Not Like Us was released last summer.\nSome people took the \"Game Over\" at the end of Kendrick's Super Bowl set as the end of the battle, and Drake's just released Gimme a Hug.\nIn that he suggests he wants to put the beef behind him and \"get the party lit\".\nBut there's still an ongoing legal case over Not Like Us - with the potential of a bitter courtroom face-off.\nMargs says that's a big contrast to settling scores on the battle rap stage. \n\"There's a sportsmanship to it but never spills over into more than that,\" says Margs.\n\"After the fight, they always hug it out and show respect for their competitor.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

So I always took that into consideration with my music,\" he said.Getty ImagesNot Like Us passed one billion streams on Spotify and won five Grammy Awards including song of the yearNot everyone agrees that a more mainstream-friendly version of rap makes Drake less credible.His one-time rival Common recently defended him against the \"pop star\" label - saying that \"he's still an MC\" even though his songs are popular.Kendrick, though, is passionate about rap as an artform, and said the success of Not Like Us and being chosen as the first solo hip-hop artist to front the halftime show \"meant everything\". \"It's a culture Kendrick wants to defend and celebrate.Speaking before the Super Bowl show, he said the \"grit\" had gone from the genre. \"When people talk about rap, the conversations I'm hearing, they think it's just rapping, it's not an actual art form,\" he said.Kendrick also took issue with rap being \"minimised to a catchy song or verse\", and said his feud with Drake actually came \"more from a space of more people putting rap to the back\". \"A lot of people see him as being responsible for the watering down of the product,\" says Margs.",

The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied.\nThe M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region.\nThe city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.\nEarlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 30km (19 miles) north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance.\nBut there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC.  \nIn a village further north - Mayba - 70 bodies were found in a church, according to local media reports. \nA local community coordinator in North Kivu, Vianney Vitswamba, told the DR Congo news agency 7Sur7 that the bodies were found tied up. Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels - an Islamic State-linked group - were blamed, but the BBC has not confirmed the report.\n\nResidents of Bukavu contacted by the BBC said the authorities advised residents to remain indoors.\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference, DR Congo's President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be sanctioned, accusing it of having  \"expansionist ambitions\", the AFP news agency reports. \n\"We will no longer put up with our strategic resources being plundered for the benefit of foreign interests under the complicit gaze of those who feed on chaos,\" he is quoted as saying.\nAs well as being accused of backing the rebels, which Rwanda has denied, the country is also said to have its own troops in eastern DR Congo.\nRwandan President Paul Kagame has said his country's priority is security.  He has said Rwanda is in danger from Hutu rebels in DR Congo and has dismissed any threat of sanctions.  \nThe news of the latest advance comes as the continent's heads of state are due to meet at an African Union (AU) summit in Ethiopia on Saturday.\nThe head of the AU commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat is quoted by AFP as saying that a ceasefire \"must be observed\" adding that \"military campaigns are not going to solve these problems. There is a general mobilisation of Africa today on this issue and I hope that we will be able to impose this ceasefire\".\nAdditional reporting by Alfred Lasteck.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn).

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

At one point he was 66,000th in the virtual ticket queue but vowed to stay to the bitter end.\n\"I got stuck on about 53,000 for ages,\" he said, \"then all of a sudden it went down to [just] 40-something and quicker from there.\n\"Eventually there was one person in font of me but by the time I got in, everything was sold out, even the super-expensive VIP-type tickets were gone.\n\"It wasn't meant to be this time.\" He went on to say he was \"gutted\".\nFan Emily Pywell, from London, said she was trying to get tickets for her and her boyfriend, Brandon Hall. \nThe pair had tickets to Osbourne's last solo tour No More Tours II, which was cancelled in 2023. \nShe said: \"It's just disappointing for the actual fans that want to (go), that have tried to see them for years, and have lucked out to touts and potentially not as big fans, people that are just going for the experience.\"\nThe 29-year-old said it would be her partner's \"last chance\" to see the singer. \nSpeaking about her ticket-buying experience, she added: \"We had a bigger number in the queue than we'd had during the pre-sales and the rest of the week, [we] only just really got through just now, like two hours after.\n\"It's who can refresh the fastest and click on it the fastest, it's not really a fair system on Ticketmaster.\"\nShe said on Tuesday, the seating map would not load - and when she contacted Ticketmaster on X, she was told to refresh the page only to be kicked to the back of the queue. \n\"Yesterday, I was clicking on seats that are available, but it wasn't selecting them, even though I was clicking on them, so I wasn't able to do it then.\n\"And then today, it's just doing the same, you're just trying to click on them, and it won't select them, or it'll come up saying someone else has already bought them.\"\nMs Pywell now faces a battle to get hotel bookings refunded, after sorting them in advance.\nTicketmaster has been contacted for a comment. \nOthers, though, had better luck. \nSimon Humphreys, from Stourbridge in Dudley, who has an Ozzy tattoo, managed to get two hospitality tickets for \u00a31,088. \nHe explained: \"I said to my missus, this is your birthday, Valentine's, Christmas all done this year - and she's not even into rock or metal.\"\nElsewhere, fans Lauren and James Ashton, from Curdworth in Warwickshire, have been feeling excited. \nThey managed to get tickets on Thursday during a pre-sale event, thereby avoiding Friday's queue, although Mr Ashton joined it for a time just to gauge demand.\n\"I couldn't believe it really,\" he said. \"We logged in and saw we were 77,000.

        "article_text": "Ordered by the Trump administration to drop a corruption case against New York's mayor, a top federal prosecutor instead resigned in protest.\nDanielle Sassoon is known as a tough but fair conservative attorney, according to former colleagues and courtroom rivals alike.\nIn 2016, Danielle Sassoon wrote a tribute to a former boss, the late US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. She praised the conservative jurist's character, and his legal approach. Such qualities were not universal, she told readers.\n\"Sometimes, when you peek behind the curtain of power, you suffer a rude awakening,\" she wrote. \"What you find is corruption, ego, or a lack of ideals and intellectual heft.\"\nOn Thursday, Sassoon, who had served just three weeks as the interim head of the Southern District of New York offered the country a peek behind that curtain of power.\nThe 38-year-old federal prosecutor resigned on Thursday, after refusing to comply with the Justice Department's order to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\nShe did not go quietly. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, which quickly became public, Sassoon said there was no legal justification for dismissing the case.\nShe made explosive allegations of a quid-pro-quo proposed by Adams' attorneys to the justice department, and said that the top official who ordered them to stop, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, had not provided sufficient legal justification for his actions.\nAdams and his attorney, Alex Spiro, have denied Sassoon's allegation. Trump himself has denied political meddling in the criminal case.\nIn her resignation letter, Sassoon wrote: \"Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations.\"\nSassoon's resignation has sparked the most public upheaval of the criminal justice system since Donald Trump took office in January. \nSix prosecutors at the justice department's criminal and public integrity unit, including its interim leaders Kevin Driscoll and John Keller, resigned as well, CBS News, BBC News' US media partner, reported. \nHagan Scotten, another federal prosecutor, wrote in his own resignation letter that he was \"entirely in agreement\" with Sassoon's decision not to drop the Adams case.\nThose who worked with Sassoon say they are not surprised she took this extraordinary stance.\nCarrie Cohen, a former colleague at the Southern District of New York, described her as \"an excellent, diligent, tough, but fair prosecutor, exactly the type of prosecutor that people should want serving their country\".\nOn Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James lauded Sassoon as a \"profile in courage\".\nEven those who worked against Sassoon's team of prosecutors in court praised her decision.\nSassoon and her team were \"fierce advocates for the office\", said criminal defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman.\n\"While I didn't always see eye to eye with them, they were fair and just,\" he said. \nIn a Fox News appearance on Friday morning, Mayor Adams called Sassoon's allegations \"silly\" and said she was accusing him of \"a crime\".\nMr Spiro called her accusations a \"lie\".\n\"We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,\" he told CBS News.\nSassoon began her legal career at Yale Law School, where she served as a features editor for the prestigious Yale Law Journal. \nIn 2013, she went to London on a Temple Bar Scholarship, where she shadowed barristers and learned the differences between the US and UK justice systems, according to an essay she wrote about her experience abroad.\nShe also served as a foreign law clerk to Justice Hanan Melcer of the Israel Supreme Court in 2009.\nSassoon won prestigious clerkships with well known conservative jurists: Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III  of the fourth circuit court of appeals, and later Scalia, perhaps the most high-profile member of the US Supreme Court at the time.\nScalia \"taught me how to fire a pistol and a rifle, and made me feel like I had grit\", Sassoon wrote in her 2016 memorial for Scotus blog. \"He thickened my skin, which was the best preparation for a career in a male-dominated field.\"\nIn her letter to the US attorney general this week, Sassoon highlighted her work for these conservatives, potentially heading off allegations that she defied the justice department for partisan reasons.\n\"Both men instilled in me a sense of duty to contribute to the public good and up hold the rule of law, and a commitment to reasoned and thorough analysis,\" she wrote to Bondi.\nSassoon joined the Southern District of New York in 2016 after stints at a white collar firm and on the faculty at New York University Law School. She is a member of the Federalist Society, a professional group of conservative lawyers and scholars.\nShe prosecuted the fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, which resulted in a guilty verdict and a sentence of 25 years in prison.\n\"There was an abundance of evidence in that case and the outcome was expected by all, but it was complex and the prosecutors were very professional, organized and cogent,\" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School who followed the case closely.\nDespite her work on such high profile cases, Sassoon kept a low profile, as is typical for federal prosecutors.\nShe was temporarily leading the Southern District of New York, while Trump's choice for the top job, Jay Clayton, awaited US Senate confirmation. \nWith her conservative bona fides, she could have potentially found work in the new Republican administration.\nBut then came Bove's instruction to drop the corruption case against Adams, who was accused of accepting bribes and improper campaign contributions from foreign nationals. \nAdams has denied the claims and pleaded not guilty. His trial was set for April.\nSassoon's decision to defy orders, and reveal secretive justice department discussions on her way out the door, was extremely unusual, Manhattan attorneys said.\n\"This is the stuff you never see,\" said Arthur Aidala, a criminal defence attorney.\nThe justice department could still take retaliatory measures. \nIn his response to Sassoon, Bove wrote that he was putting assistant US attorneys involved in the Adams case on leave pending an investigation. He also said the justice department would \"evaluate your conduct\".\nBut New York lawyers say that Sassoon's act of defiance may have sprung from necessity as much as conviction.\n\"Both from a moral perspective and a practical perspective she had no choice,\" said Mark Zauderer, a high-profile appellate attorney. \"The office would have been in shambles.\"\nTo comply with Bove could have prompted a staff exodus and put the office's reputation at risk, he said.\nMs Cohen, who still considered Sassoon a friend, said she recalled the prosecutor as a staunch advocate for her colleagues.\n\"You can see that support in her decision to put the office, and her oath of office, at the forefront of her decision to resign,\" Ms Cohen said.",

        "article_text": "A Russian drone has hit the protective shelter over Chernobyl's damaged nuclear reactor, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.\nThe overnight strike at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident caused a fire that has since been extinguished, he added.\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog (the IAEA) said radiation levels inside and outside Chernobyl were normal and stable - but later the plant's chief engineer, Oleksandr Titarchuk, said the possibility of radioactive substances leaking \"now exists\".\nRussia has denied any claims it attacked Chernobyl, stating its military does not strike Ukrainian nuclear infrastructure and \"any claims that this was the case do not correspond to reality\".\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors nuclear safety around the world, said fire safety personnel and vehicles responded within minutes to an overnight explosion. No casualties were reported, the agency added.\nThe agency remains on \"high alert\" after the incident, with its director general Rafael Grossi saying there is \"no room for complacency\". \nMr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\". \nA catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.\nWhile the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.\nThe radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.\nZelensky posted footage on X appearing to show damage to the giant shield, made of concrete and steel, which covers the remains of the reactor that lost its roof in the explosion.\n\"Another 15 metres [50ft] to the side and there would have been a radiation accident,\" Hryhoriy Ishchenko, chief of the agency that manages the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, told reporters, according to local media.\nSince 1990, Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, while he admits the strike was a \"horrendous attack on a very important structure\", he is \"not concerned\" about the radiation risk.\nProf Smith told the BBC a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" below the damaged outer shield covers radioactive particles and dust from the explosion. \nSimon Evans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was head of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, which oversaw the construction of the protective dome in the 2010s.\nHe described the apparent strike as \"an incredibly reckless attack on a vulnerable nuclear facility\". \nThe shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.\nThe strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.\nThere appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.\nMr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.\n\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.\nZelensky claimed the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"definitely not preparing for negotiations\", after US President Donald Trump said Putin had agreed to begin talks to end the war earlier this week.\nThe incident at Chernobyl comes after increased military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, the IAEA said. \nIn December, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching a drone attack on a convoy of vehicles transporting IAEA experts heading to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear station.\nThe agency last year urged restraint when an attack on Zaporizhzhia raised the risk of a \"major nuclear incident\". Russia and Ukraine traded blame over the attack in August.\n\"I'm more concerned about Zaporizhzhia than Chernobyl,\" Prof Smith said. \n\"The reactors [at Zaporizhzhia] are currently shut down but there is more live fuel there. Chernobyl is still very radioactive, but it's not in a 'hot state' because of its age.\"\nThe number of people who died in the Chernobyl disaster remains disputed. \nAccording to the official, internationally recognised death toll, just 31 people died as an immediate result of Chernobyl while the UN estimates that 50 deaths can be directly attributed to the disaster. \nIn 2005, it predicted a further 4,000 might eventually die as a result of the radiation exposure.",

        "article_text": "Jamal Musiala has signed a new contract that will keep him at Bayern Munich until at least 2030\n\"People go to the stadium because of Jamal Musiala. He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn \u00a320.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted.

        "article_text": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues. \nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option?

        "article_text": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues. \nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model.

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours.

I didn't see it, I heard it. That made me nervous,\" he said.\n\"But later, with the video, I realised that it actually appeared before me in such a huge size that perhaps if I had seen it, it would have scared me even more.\"\nFor Adri\u00e1n, the experience was not just about survival - but he said felt he had received a \"second chance\" when the whale spat him out.\nThe \"unique\" experience in one of the most extreme places on Earth had \"invited me to reflect on what I could have done better up until that point, and on the ways I can take advantage of the experience and appreciate it as well\", he added.\nBut there is a simple reason he was able to escape the whale so quickly, according to a wildlife expert.\nHumpback whales have narrow throats \"about the size of a household pipe\" designed for swallowing small fish and shrimp, Brazilian conservationist Roched Jacobson Seba told the BBC.\n\"They physically cannot swallow large objects like kayaks, tires, or even big fish like tuna,\" he said.\n\"Ultimately, the whale spit out the kayak because it was physically impossible to swallow.\"\nThe humpback whale likely engulfed Adri\u00e1n by accident, Mr Seba suggested.\n\"The whale was likely feeding on a school of fish when it unintentionally scooped up the kayak along with its meal.\n\"When whales surface too quickly while feeding, they can accidentally hit or engulf objects in their path.\"\nHe warned that the encounter served as \"an important reminder\" to avoid using paddleboards, surfboards or other silent vessels in areas where whales usually swim.\nBoats used for whale watching and research must always keep their engines on, he added, as the noise helps whales detect their presence.\nAdditional reporting by Luis Barrucho and Maia Davies.",

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

To do something, we need to sell players.\n\"Our focus now is to win these games. Then we have time to focus on that.\"\nAlthough Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof are out of contract at the end of the season and Jadon Sancho due to complete a permanent move to Chelsea, there are question marks over the futures of United's highest earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford, who has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nAmorim's words will also spark fears homegrown pair Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho might be off-loaded in order for the club to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules which, it has been confirmed, will remain in force next season.\nIn addition to a history of poor recruitment, it appears United have failed to get the most out of the players at Old Trafford.\nScotland midfielder Scott McTominay never appeared to be a regular starter but has excelled since his \u00a325.7m move to Italian side Napoli last August.\nThe 28-year-old has scored six goals in 21 Serie A appearances - and three in his last six as his side have charged to the top of the table.\nEven more startling, Brazilian winger Antony has scored twice in three games since he completed a loan move to Real Betis, having scored just four times in 52 appearances for United since the start of last season.\n\"This is a club with a lot of pressure,\" added Amorim. \"You have to have a base and in this moment we don't have it.\n\"But football is like that. When you reach this level, you have to cope with that.\"\nUnited are hoping to ease their financial situation by developing better young players to sell.\nTheir under-18 team reached the FA Youth Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday with an impressive 5-1 win over Chelsea and highly rated youngster Chido Obi scoring a hat-trick.\nHaving revealed he had injury concerns over some unnamed players for Sunday's Premier League trip to Tottenham Hotspur, Amorim confirmed 17-year-old former Arsenal academy graduate Obi had been called into first-team training.\n\"We have problems this week,\" he said. \"We called some young players to be in our training. We have some data evaluation. He is one of them.\"\nIf there is one club challenging United as this season's chronic underachievers it is Tottenham.\nAlthough the north London outfit have beaten the Old Trafford outfit twice this season, in the Premier League and EFL Cup, and also hammered Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, they still find themselves two points behind, with manager Ange Postecoglou under intense pressure.\nAmorim is a fan of the Australian, but he doesn't feel the situations they find themselves in are comparable.\n\"I am a huge fan of Ange Postecoglou,\" he added. \"He is a good guy and a very good coach.\n\"I understand the connection with me and Ange but, with respect, I am at a bigger club.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has won 10 and lost eight of his 20 games in charge\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says the club will have to sell players if they are to buy anyone this summer.\nDespite being in the bottom half of the Premier League table, United only spent \u00a325m on 20-year-old full-back Patrick Dorgu in the January transfer window.\nIt has been stressed by club sources that, after losses of over \u00a3300m in the past three years, United's profit and sustainability position is 'tight'.\nHowever, it has now been established that cost-cutting away from the first-team squad will continue, with another round of redundancies imminent and the London office likely to close.\nCo-owners Ineos Group has also tried to renegotiate its sponsorship agreement with the New Zealand All Blacks and split with leading yachtsman Ben Ainslie.\nAsked what impact this would have on summer plans to reshape his squad, Amorim said: \"It is simple. To do something, we need to sell players.\n\"Our focus now is to win these games. Then we have time to focus on that.\"\nAlthough Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof are out of contract at the end of the season and Jadon Sancho due to complete a permanent move to Chelsea, there are question marks over the futures of United's highest earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford, who has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nAmorim's words will also spark fears homegrown pair Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho might be off-loaded in order for the club to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules which, it has been confirmed, will remain in force next season.\nIn addition to a history of poor recruitment, it appears United have failed to get the most out of the players at Old Trafford.\nScotland midfielder Scott McTominay never appeared to be a regular starter but has excelled since his \u00a325.7m move to Italian side Napoli last August.\nThe 28-year-old has scored six goals in 21 Serie A appearances - and three in his last six as his side have charged to the top of the table.\nEven more startling, Brazilian winger Antony has scored twice in three games since he completed a loan move to Real Betis, having scored just four times in 52 appearances for United since the start of last season.\n\"This is a club with a lot of pressure,\" added Amorim. \"You have to have a base and in this moment we don't have it.\n\"But football is like that. When you reach this level, you have to cope with that.\"\nUnited are hoping to ease their financial situation by developing better young players to sell.\nTheir under-18 team reached the FA Youth Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday with an impressive 5-1 win over Chelsea and highly rated youngster Chido Obi scoring a hat-trick.\nHaving revealed he had injury concerns over some unnamed players for Sunday's Premier League trip to Tottenham Hotspur, Amorim confirmed 17-year-old former Arsenal academy graduate Obi had been called into first-team training.\n\"We have problems this week,\" he said. \"We called some young players to be in our training. We have some data evaluation. He is one of them.\"\nIf there is one club challenging United as this season's chronic underachievers it is Tottenham.\nAlthough the north London outfit have beaten the Old Trafford outfit twice this season, in the Premier League and EFL Cup, and also hammered Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, they still find themselves two points behind, with manager Ange Postecoglou under intense pressure.\nAmorim is a fan of the Australian, but he doesn't feel the situations they find themselves in are comparable.\n\"I am a huge fan of Ange Postecoglou,\" he added. \"He is a good guy and a very good coach.\n\"I understand the connection with me and Ange but, with respect, I am at a bigger club.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nA popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: \"I don't care about Levy, he doesn't care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski.\"\nProminent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: \"Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed\" and \"24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change\".\nA crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.\nThe debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.\nFan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.\nClub sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.\nTottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.\nA 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\nLast week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.\nAmong those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.\nBBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.\nSome of the key points made were:\nLevy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structures\nHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide away\nAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially\nClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals\nSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies.\nA banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy's tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the \"most profitable club in Premier League history\" because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a \"degree of caution\" on transfer spending.\nHe describes Spurs as a \"superb cash-making machine\" who have \"outperformed any other club in England\".\nMaguire outlined:\nHis figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made \u00a3171m profit.

In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned \u00a36.6m.\nDaniel Levy has been Tottenham's chairman since 2001\nClub insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham's progress under his leadership.\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be \"very ruthless\" but \"genuinely wants the best for Spurs\".\nThey claimed some of the \"own goals\" - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not \"surround himself with the best people\". \nThey described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as \"people too similar to him\" who will \"sit with their heads in their phones\", rather than \"people who make up for [Levy's] weaknesses\".\nThe source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: \"One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot.\"\nWhile Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".\nAnother source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".\nThey added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.\nFrom the archive: Inside Levy's 20 years at Tottenham (2021)\nPostecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy?\nIs Postecoglou's style causing Tottenham's injury crisis?\nSources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. \nThey say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table.\nWhile Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner.\nThat means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say.\nDuring the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club.\nOther sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League's highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated \u00a350m-plus over his 25 years in charge.\nThis week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs' ownership situation played it down.\nIn 2023, when Paris St-Germain's owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\nOne source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \"more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement\" - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates.\nVarious reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn.\nChelsea were bought in a deal worth up to \u00a34.25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was \u00a32.5bn with a commitment to spending \u00a31.75bn over the next 10 years.\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for \u00a31.03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to \u00a35bn for 100% of the club.\nDespite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential.\nAccording to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new \u00a31.2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was \"all-consumed\" and the board \"left everyone to do their jobs\". \nSpurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.\nThat source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.\nPaul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.\nIt could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".\nAnother source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".\nThey said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.\nHowever, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. \nOne criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.\nLevy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".\nThey are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.\nThe source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.\nThey added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.\nIt was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".\nSources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. \nThey will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation.\nTottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.\nIt is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models.\nSpurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the 'traditional top six' are either richer or bigger.\n\"We don't make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don't apologise at all,\" Levy said at September's fan forum.\n\"We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we've got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we're looking for.\"\nIn a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United's 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. \nThey believe a \"vocal minority\" of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change.\nThey added: \"Spurs haven't got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come.\"\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

Spurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.That source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.Paul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.It could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".Another source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".They said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.However, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. Does Levy lack football nous?One criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.Levy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".They are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.The source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.They added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.It was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".Sources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned \u00a36.6m.What is it like to work under Levy?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Daniel Levy has been Tottenham's chairman since 2001Club insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism.",

So it's a big blow, obviously, because of the injuries that we have. \nHavertz joins Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli on the sidelines, leaving Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and teenager Ethan Nwaneri as the side's only recognised forwards.\nArteta has had to deal with a number of injury issues throughout the season, with the likes of Ben White, Martin Odegaard and Riccardo Calafiori all missing lengthy spells. \nIn September, Manchester City captain Rodri said players were 'close' to going on strike to protest against the increase in matches due to revamped Uefa competitions and a Fifa Club World Cup.\nA week later, he was ruled out for at least six months after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament. \n\"We've had players who are injured who've played 130 games in the last two seasons so it's an accident waiting to happen when you continue to load, load and load,\" said Arteta. \n\"The intensity is at a different level and the demands in terms of minutes in this competitive environment is getting higher and higher and it's a consequence of that. \n\"The amount of muscle and tendon injuries is higher than ever so there's a relationship.\n\"We're very limited and we're training less than ever. There's no time for training.\"\nWith the transfer window now closed, Arteta says he would consider signing a free agent to ease the club's injury crisis in attack. \n\"I'll explore every possible situation and make a decision from there,\" he said. \nThis video can not be played\nCan Ethan Nwaneri solve Arsenal's injury crisis?\nWatch The Football News Show's Premier League weekend preview\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone\nBen Dinnery, founder of Premier Injuries, says there has been a reduction in injuries this season compared to the previous campaign. \n\"The narrative is that injuries are going through the roof this season, but they are actually not,\" Dinnery told BBC Sport's Football News Show.\n\"In terms of time loss absence we've actually seen a reduction season on season over the same period compared to 2023-24 by roughly 13%.\"\nHowever, Dinnery says there has been an increase in muscle injuries such as hamstring strains. \n\"I's the type of injuries [getting more severe] and the length of return to play that is taking a little bit longer,\" said Dinnery. \n\"When we took the 2023-24 season in isolation, looking at the previous four on average, we've seen an increase in hamstring injuries, certainly at the severe end, by about 65%. \n\"By severe we mean hamstring injuries that are likely to keep a player out for more than 30 days.

        "article_text": "The spotlight is on Philippe Clement (left) and Jimmy Thelin (right) while Daizen Maeda could be Celtic's key man in Munich\nThe Premiership returns this weekend after a Scottish Cup weekend that did not lack for storylines.\nThe Ibrox inner sanctum has said nothing about Philippe Clement's position since their cup exit and in that vacuum gossip and fan fury have thrived. \nRangers' trip to Tynecastle on Sunday is therefore eagerly awaited - and so too is Aberdeen's game against Dundee, with Jimmy Thelin also remarkably feeling the heat.\nThere are calmer waters at Celtic, but the biggest game of their season looms large.\nHere are a few things to look out for this weekend...\nClement will perhaps be surprised he is still in charge at Ibrox after the embarrassing Scottish Cup exit against Queen's Park.\nWith Rangers failing to mount a title challenge, the defeat against the Spiders has turned up the heat significantly on the Belgian.\nRangers' hierarchy have been tight-lipped all week, which is a backing of sorts. But Clement will surely know a poor result at Tynecastle will nudge him closer to an exit.\nSix weeks ago he might have fancied his side's chances of earning a morale-boosting victory, but Neil Critchley has steadily improved Heart of Midlothian since taking time to assess the squad.\nThey have won four of their five league games in 2025 - with one draw - which is as many victories as in their final 22 matches of 2024.\nCammy Devlin has been pivotal to their resurgence. He tops the table for the number of tackles (23) as well as being joint-top for interceptions in the Premiership in 2025. \nTo get at Hearts' defence, first you have to find a way past the Australia defensive midfielder. His availability after a concussion at St Mirren on Monday could well be key to this game.\nThe loan signing of Belgian striker Elton Kabangu seems to have liberated Lawrence Shankland too, and the Jambos showed the sort of resilience that was sorely lacking earlier in the season when they edged past the Buddies in the Scottish Cup.\nYet, despite the cloud hanging over Clement, Rangers have won each of their past four league games - and all by a margin of at least two goals. It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.\nHistory is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.\nRangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.\nThat record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.\nThis video can not be played\nMOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'\nThird-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.\nThat said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.\nSo, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.\nCould that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?\nHe has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.\nPerhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.\nMight Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?\nIf he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?\nThis video can not be played\nHighlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline Athletic\nEvery new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.\nIt usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.\nThen Thelin pitched up. \nThe Dons had chased the Swede for a long time before landing him and it soon became clear why they had been so patient. Ten wins from their first 11 Premiership games at the start of the season and a dramatic point at Celtic led to talk of a title challenge.\nThelin had somehow turned largely the same squad that saw off Neil Warnock within eight games into one that seemed poised to push Celtic into the new year.  \nHis stock went through the roof and there was even gossip linking him with ambitious Birmingham City.\nBut if his stock rose rapidly, it has dropped even more quickly. Aberdeen have lost eight and drawn one of their past nine league games - as many defeats as in their previous 37 games.\nThey have gone from putting pressure on Celtic in second to fourth - just five points ahead of eighth. Thelin, incredibly, is under serious pressure for his job within two months of being touted as Fergie 2.0.\nHis tactics and style of play have been criticised, with suggestions other teams have now worked him out.\nThe good news for him is the Dons play Dundee next.\nAberdeen's last league win was against Dundee, three months ago, and the last time they won an away league game was against Dundee, almost five months ago.\nTony Docherty's side have conceded more goals (53) and faced a higher expected goals against total (46.1) than any other side in the Premiership this season. \nThey have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. \nOh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.\nAberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. \nHe will know that if he doesn't, he then faces exacting matches against former Dons boss Derek McInnes' new side Kilmarnock, Celtic and third-placed Dundee United.",

        "summary": "It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.History is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.Rangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.That record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, MOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'Player to watch - Daizen Maeda (Celtic)Third-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.That said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.So, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.Could that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?He has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.Perhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.Might Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?If he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline AthleticManager in the spotlight - Jimmy Thelin (Aberdeen)Every new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.It usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.Then Thelin pitched up. Thelin, incredibly, is under serious pressure for his job within two months of being touted as Fergie 2.0.His tactics and style of play have been criticised, with suggestions other teams have now worked him out.The good news for him is the Dons play Dundee next.Aberdeen's last league win was against Dundee, three months ago, and the last time they won an away league game was against Dundee, almost five months ago.Tony Docherty's side have conceded more goals (53) and faced a higher expected goals against total (46.1) than any other side in the Premiership this season. Oh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.Aberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. They have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. Rangers' trip to Tynecastle on Sunday is therefore eagerly awaited - and so too is Aberdeen's game against Dundee, with Jimmy Thelin also remarkably feeling the heat.There are calmer waters at Celtic, but the biggest game of their season looms large.Here are a few things to look out for this weekend...Game of the weekend - Hearts v RangersClement will perhaps be surprised he is still in charge at Ibrox after the embarrassing Scottish Cup exit against Queen's Park.With Rangers failing to mount a title challenge, the defeat against the Spiders has turned up the heat significantly on the Belgian.Rangers' hierarchy have been tight-lipped all week, which is a backing of sorts.",

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "article_text": "Solitary lifestyles can have some big advantages in the animal world. Can humans learn anything from them?\nThe Middle East blind mole rat is the ultimate introvert. Residing about a foot underground, it digs out its own tunnel systems where it stays for most of its life, gathering roots, tubers, and bulbs. Each mole rat has its own territory \u2013 for good reason; if one mole rat accidentally burrows into another one's tunnel, the rodents will bare their teeth or bite each other in violent, often deadly battles.\u00a0\nBlind mole rats generally only interact with others of their species during the mating season, but even then, they must proceed cautiously. The male digs through the soil towards a female but pauses before entering her tunnel. For several days, they send vibrational signals to each other by drumming on the tunnel ceiling with their heads. Only when the female expresses an interest to meet will the male advance, mate with her, and leave. After closing the tunnel behind him, he continues his reclusive way of life.\nSolitary lifestyles such as this are remarkably widespread across the animal kingdom. Even among mammals \u2013 a generally sociable bunch \u2013 22% of studied species are largely solitary, meaning that males and females sleep and forage or hunt alone for most of the time.\nBut solitary animals have received relatively little attention from scientists. Perhaps because we are social creatures ourselves, we've been more drawn to studying creatures that cooperate in groups for protection or to find food, breed and raise young. Experts say that for a long time, many scientists have tended to overlook the solitary life, deeming it a more primitive, basic state of existence, associated with anti-social behaviour and poor intelligence.\u00a0\nBut researchers are now coming to recognise that some animals have evolved to be solitary precisely because it can be so beneficial to avoid the competition and stressful conditions of group living. To boot, many solitary animals are in fact highly intelligent and live diverse and complex social lives, despite their solitude. Though blind mole rats are an exception, many solitary animals do tolerate, learn from and occasionally even cooperate with others of their kind, allowing them to enjoy the best of both worlds.\nAs humans are increasingly spending more time alone, these animals remind us of the many benefits of solitude and that living alone does not equal lonely \u2013 a thought perhaps worth considering for people spending Valentine's Day alone.\n\"Maybe by studying solitary species and how they succeed with this tactic\u2026 we can also better identify for human society what is good about being alone,\" says behavioural ecologist Carsten Schradin of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique in Strasbourg, France, and co-author of a 2024 review about solitary living in mammals.\nLiving in groups certainly has many benefits. Think of zebras that find safety in herds and lions that often hunt together to overcome prey larger and faster than themselves. Some birds collaborate to raise young and chimps that socialise by picking parasites off each other. But it also has downsides. In a group, \"every shelter has to be shared, every bit of food has to be shared, every access to a mate has to be shared\", says David Scheel, a behavioural ecologist at Alaska Pacific University. \"Or if it's not shareable, only one of you can get it.\"\nAnd while hunting together and sharing food makes sense for animals like lions that are often surrounded by abundant, large prey that can feed multiple individuals, this is less beneficial in situations where prey is smaller and less shareable. Nor is it as helpful when prey is scattered throughout the landscape where it takes more effort to find them.\nThis is probably why armadillos and anteaters forage alone for few-and-far-between insects, and why tigers \u2013 which roam far and wide to find relatively scarce prey \u2013 hunt by themselves, helping them to sneak up on their prey more easily. To further reduce competition, tigers and some other solitary hunters form small territories that they defend from other predators.\nFor blind mole rats, solitude means not needing to constantly compete for tunnel space, which takes a lot of energy to dig. Solitary animals may also face less competition for mates and a reduced risk of contracting diseases and parasites. Meanwhile, young-raising females can invest all their energy into caring for their own offspring without having to tend to their neighbours' young, like some more social species do. For other creatures, like sloths, their camouflage may only work if they're not in large groups.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If you're solitary-living, you're less conspicuous,\" says Lindelani Mayuka, a zoologist from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa and co-author of the review with Schradin.\u00a0\nLiving alone does create other challenges \u2013 such as missing out on the benefit of huddling together to stay warm. But some animals like the bush Karoo rat of southern Africa get around this by building big stick lodges to protect themselves from temperature swings as well as predators, Mayuka says.\nFor highly social animals, being alone can be stressful \u2013 often leading to poor health and anxiety \u2013 but solitary animals do just fine. In fact, Middle East blind mole rats become stressed and anxious when they're placed next to one another, even if there's a barrier between them, with smaller, more submissive individuals suffering the most.\u00a0\n\"They can die from the stress that they have,\" says Tali Kimchi, a behavioural neuroscientist at the Weizmann Institute in Israel who studies the blind mole rats in her laboratory. Like all mammals, blind mole rat mothers tend to their offspring, but mums eventually become hostile, forcing their young to dig away from her tunnel. \"It sounds funny, but that's the survival of these creatures,\" she says.\nNot all solitary species actively repel each other. Many of them are drawn together by shared resources and have surprisingly rich social lives, tolerating each other and even cooperating when it makes sense. For example, bush Karoo rats that live close to related individuals have frequent, amicable interactions with one another \u2013 sharing foraging grounds with related females and sometimes even stick lodges at the end of the breeding season when there\u2019s a great demand for stock lodges.\n\"Just because some animals are solitary living does not mean that they do not have social interactions,\" Mayuka says.\nEven some octopuses \u2013 a group once considered so solitary it was a running joke that they'd only meet to mate or eat each other \u2013 sometimes aggregate, Scheel says. At one site in Jervis Bay in eastern Australia, individuals of a species called the gloomy octopus are drawn together by the availability of shelter. This probably started when one octopus piled up discarded shells after eating and these eventually stabilised enough of the sediment that another octopus could build its burrow inside. This new resident then created its own pile of discarded shells \u2013 until as many as 16 octopuses gathered on one spot, says Scheel, who has been studying the site with his colleagues.\nIn this \"octopus city\", individuals find themselves in a much more crowded situation than they are used to and exhibit curious behaviours to cope with others of their kind.\nMales sometimes try to coerce females into staying nearby and chase other males \u2013 occasionally crawling into each other's dens, wrestling with and evicting them. Sometimes when evicted males come back to their den, \"the evicting male may return and repeat the eviction\", Scheel says. And as they clean out their dens, the octopuses often push debris onto their neighbours' side. Sometimes, they hold the debris and use their funnels to blast it at one another, says Scheel, who documented some of these interactions in a 2022 paper.\nNeither aggressive nor cooperative, some scientists call these behaviours \"jostling\", says Scheel, who is still working out the purpose of these interactions. \"Here we've plopped a solitary animal into a complex social situation, and all they're doing is jostling, and they seem totally healthy. That suggests they're either less solitary than we thought, or the stresses of being [social] are not that severe [for them].\"\nThese sophisticated social interactions underscore the intelligence of solitary creatures. Similarly, researchers have seen some solitary reptiles closely watching other individuals and using that information to solve problems \u2013 an ability once thought to be unique to humans, says behavioural scientist Anna Wilkinson of the University of Lincoln in the UK. \"Animals who maybe wouldn't naturally form complex groups can actually have really quite sophisticated aspects of social learning,\" she says.\nIn experiments with red-footed tortoises, which forage by themselves but might encounter one another under fruiting trees, for example, Wilkinson presented them with a V-shaped, transparent fence with food on the inside. No animal could reach the food until Wilkinson and her colleagues trained one of them how to do it. Upon seeing their fellow reptile reach the food, the other tortoises immediately followed suit. It's especially remarkable to see that reptiles have the ability to learn from other individuals by imitation, considering that many of them have evolved to\u00a0hatch\u00a0from eggs without a parent around to teach them skills.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The linguist learning to speak 'cow'\n\u2022 The eerie ambassador from the abyss\n\u2022 Why some animals appear to mourn their dead\nEvidence like this is causing scientists to see solitary living not as a fixed, uniform category, but rather as a continuum: from animals like the (arguably) antisocial blind mole rat to species that live largely alone but learn from and cooperate with one another. Some species even blend solitary and more social lifestyles, like communally living striped mice that go solo once they start breeding, or raccoon-like coatis, whose males are solitary and females hunt in bands.\nStudying solitary animals and their social networks can help conservationists better protect and preserve their populations from human threats. Mayuka and Schradin have already started an effort to build a community of scientists to further decipher the lives, benefits, needs and challenges of solitary animals. \"Being solitary is not simple and primitive,\" Schradin says. \"It can be quite complex and provide challenges\u2026 which are solved in different ways by different species.\"\nUnderstanding the full breadth of solitary living could even be helpful for people. Kimchi is studying changes in the brains of blind mole rats as they switch between introverted and more social mating and pup-raising stages. Perhaps such research can help scientists understand how people with neurological or psychiatric conditions become socially withdrawn, she says.\u00a0\nBut solitary animals can also help us consider that being alone doesn't necessarily have to be problematic, even if it has been somewhat stigmatised in our extrovert-driven society, says Schradin. \"Social\" solitary animals construct meaningful social networks around them \u2013 and people living by themselves can, and do, too. \"Being alone,\" Schradin says, \"can also be the best choice for many humans.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\n\u00a0For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

This new resident then created its own pile of discarded shells \u2013 until as many as 16 octopuses gathered on one spot, says Scheel, who has been studying the site with his colleagues.\nIn this \"octopus city\", individuals find themselves in a much more crowded situation than they are used to and exhibit curious behaviours to cope with others of their kind.\nMales sometimes try to coerce females into staying nearby and chase other males \u2013 occasionally crawling into each other's dens, wrestling with and evicting them. Sometimes when evicted males come back to their den, \"the evicting male may return and repeat the eviction\", Scheel says. And as they clean out their dens, the octopuses often push debris onto their neighbours' side. Sometimes, they hold the debris and use their funnels to blast it at one another, says Scheel, who documented some of these interactions in a 2022 paper.\nNeither aggressive nor cooperative, some scientists call these behaviours \"jostling\", says Scheel, who is still working out the purpose of these interactions. \"Here we've plopped a solitary animal into a complex social situation, and all they're doing is jostling, and they seem totally healthy. That suggests they're either less solitary than we thought, or the stresses of being [social] are not that severe [for them].\"\nThese sophisticated social interactions underscore the intelligence of solitary creatures. Similarly, researchers have seen some solitary reptiles closely watching other individuals and using that information to solve problems \u2013 an ability once thought to be unique to humans, says behavioural scientist Anna Wilkinson of the University of Lincoln in the UK. \"Animals who maybe wouldn't naturally form complex groups can actually have really quite sophisticated aspects of social learning,\" she says.\nIn experiments with red-footed tortoises, which forage by themselves but might encounter one another under fruiting trees, for example, Wilkinson presented them with a V-shaped, transparent fence with food on the inside. No animal could reach the food until Wilkinson and her colleagues trained one of them how to do it. Upon seeing their fellow reptile reach the food, the other tortoises immediately followed suit. It's especially remarkable to see that reptiles have the ability to learn from other individuals by imitation, considering that many of them have evolved to\u00a0hatch\u00a0from eggs without a parent around to teach them skills.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The linguist learning to speak 'cow'\n\u2022 The eerie ambassador from the abyss\n\u2022 Why some animals appear to mourn their dead\nEvidence like this is causing scientists to see solitary living not as a fixed, uniform category, but rather as a continuum: from animals like the (arguably) antisocial blind mole rat to species that live largely alone but learn from and cooperate with one another. Some species even blend solitary and more social lifestyles, like communally living striped mice that go solo once they start breeding, or raccoon-like coatis, whose males are solitary and females hunt in bands.\nStudying solitary animals and their social networks can help conservationists better protect and preserve their populations from human threats. Mayuka and Schradin have already started an effort to build a community of scientists to further decipher the lives, benefits, needs and challenges of solitary animals. \"Being solitary is not simple and primitive,\" Schradin says. \"It can be quite complex and provide challenges\u2026 which are solved in different ways by different species.\"\nUnderstanding the full breadth of solitary living could even be helpful for people. Kimchi is studying changes in the brains of blind mole rats as they switch between introverted and more social mating and pup-raising stages. Perhaps such research can help scientists understand how people with neurological or psychiatric conditions become socially withdrawn, she says.\u00a0\nBut solitary animals can also help us consider that being alone doesn't necessarily have to be problematic, even if it has been somewhat stigmatised in our extrovert-driven society, says Schradin. \"Social\" solitary animals construct meaningful social networks around them \u2013 and people living by themselves can, and do, too. \"Being alone,\" Schradin says, \"can also be the best choice for many humans.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\n\u00a0For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "\"Maybe by studying solitary species and how they succeed with this tactic\u2026 we can also better identify for human society what is good about being alone,\" says behavioural ecologist Carsten Schradin of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique in Strasbourg, France, and co-author of a 2024 review about solitary living in mammals.Getty ImagesThe Middle East blind mole rat is the ultimate introvert (Credit: Getty Images)Living in groups certainly has many benefits. Though blind mole rats are an exception, many solitary animals do tolerate, learn from and occasionally even cooperate with others of their kind, allowing them to enjoy the best of both worlds.As humans are increasingly spending more time alone, these animals remind us of the many benefits of solitude and that living alone does not equal lonely \u2013 a thought perhaps worth considering for people spending Valentine's Day alone. But some animals like the bush Karoo rat of southern Africa get around this by building big stick lodges to protect themselves from temperature swings as well as predators, Mayuka says.For highly social animals, being alone can be stressful \u2013 often leading to poor health and anxiety \u2013 but solitary animals do just fine. \"Animals who maybe wouldn't naturally form complex groups can actually have really quite sophisticated aspects of social learning,\" she says.Peter Godfrey-SmithOctopuses are famously solitary but one species, gloomy octopuses, are sometimes found living in groups, where they appear to tolerate one another (Credit: Peter Godfrey-Smith)In experiments with red-footed tortoises, which forage by themselves but might encounter one another under fruiting trees, for example, Wilkinson presented them with a V-shaped, transparent fence with food on the inside.

        "article_text": "Nada Hafez competed for Egypt in the women's individual sabre fencing event at the Paris Olympics while seven months pregnant\n\"I was thinking about my baby, that I want my baby to be an Olympian.\" \nThat was the extra motivation that Egyptian fencer Nada Hafez needed when she took to the piste at Paris 2024.\nOnly a select few knew she was competing while seven months pregnant until she revealed the news on social media following her last-16 exit from her event. \nIt made headlines the world over.\nThe whirlwind reaction was like nothing Hafez had experienced before.\n\"I was just posting on my personal account - proud, saying I'm in the top 16 in the world while pregnant,\" Hafez told BBC Sport Africa. \n\"I didn't expect this would go viral. I didn't know what was going on.\"\nThe 27-year-old says the majority of responses to her message were positive.\n\"When the post went up, and I was an inspiration for everyone, this was a big thing for me.\"\nHafez, who is a clinical pathologist, says she had been given clearance from doctors to fence at the Games and wanted to show the world what a woman's body can do.\n\"This was a really important message for me - an Egyptian Arab woman - to tell all women that your body can surprise you,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes you need to see an example in front of you to know that you can do it. \n\"Because maybe a pregnant woman, she's afraid to do anything, and now she tells herself: 'There's a woman who competes at the Olympics while pregnant. So I can do whatever'.\"\nHafez upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky of the United States, in her first match at Paris 2024\nBut not everyone was so supportive of Hafez revealing that she fenced in the women's individual sabre at the Grand Palais while carrying a baby.\nA day later Hafez put out another Instagram post to emphasise she was not the first pregnant woman to appear at an Olympics and that she had wanted to \"shed light on the strength, perseverance and relentlessness\" of Egyptian women.\nThat strength came to the fore when dealing with negativity online.\n\"Some people don't want to see you succeed,\" she reflected.\n\"It's easy to put a comment and run. You don't face me.\n\"I wanted to clarify that I'm a doctor and this (competing while pregnant) is something that is not against any medical issues.\n\"Some people were saying I should have given the place to someone else. But this was not an option because I qualified.\n\"My mum told me 'Don't be sad if you read anything' - but I'm proud of what I did. I achieved something and it was very challenging.\"\nWith fencing being a combat sport using swords, could that have provoked the negative comments?\n\"For me, fencing is not as it looks - it has this sense of touch. My doctor assured me that it's not unsafe.\"\nHafez took up fencing aged 12 and has appeared at the past three editions of the Olympic Games\nCairo-based Hafez, who pursued her passion for fencing while studying for her medical degree, became an Egyptian sabre champion and went to both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games. \nSo, having qualified for Paris 2024, did she consider pulling out when she discovered she was pregnant? \n\"Yes, of course. I knew I was pregnant a week before a World Cup [event], and I said, 'Okay, I won't chance it because it's my first pregnancy',\" she explained.\n\"I didn't know how I would feel. \n\"I was waiting for my husband [a cardiothoracic surgeon] to tell me to stop and take rest. But he told me: 'We'll go to the doctor. Whatever he says, we'll do.'\n\"And the doctor said: 'You don't have a disease. You're just pregnant. If you're okay and everything is normal, you can do whatever you want.'\"\nWith that reassurance, Hafez felt ready to resume training. \nMindful of the spotlight falling on her nation if the news came out, she kept it as quiet as she could.\n\"I didn't have to tell anyone, because it's not against Olympic regulations,\" she said.\n\"I just told the people who needed to know. The most important thing was not to go against any laws or health conditions.\n\"I didn't know if I would make it so I took it step by step until I reached the Olympics.\"\nEgypt's National Olympic Committee told BBC Sport Africa it has no rules barring pregnant women from training or competing.\n\"But it has to be a safe environment and we have to make sure there is no risk involved,\" an official said.\nNada Hafez was full of emotion after she made it through to the last 16 of the Paris Games, her third Olympics having also competed at at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020\nNow a mum to four-month-old baby Zaina, Hafez can reflect on the part her daughter played in her achievements in Paris.\n\"I worked with my mental coach. I wanted to do something different for my baby,\" she said.\n\"I tried not to think that I have my excuse not to win. I thought differently: 'I'm pregnant and I will win', and I did it.\"\nHafez went on to upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky, 15-13.\n\"It's one of the best results for female Egyptian Olympians,\" Hafez added.\n\"I was crying with happiness. This is something for my baby to be proud of.\"\nShe then lost 15-7 to Jeon Hayoung of South Korea in the last 16.\nNeither of her opponents knew Hafez was expecting. \n\"It's unfair if someone knows. Maybe they'd be afraid to put a touch or something, so no need to tell them.\"\nHafez, who is studying for a masters degree alongside being a new mum, is aiming to use her platform to stand up for women's rights in sport.\nShe has not yet decided whether she wants to try and qualify for Los Angeles 2028.\nFor now, she is still processing what she achieved in Paris.\n\"Young girls told me, 'You've inspired us so much. We want to go to medical school and continue in sports',\" she said.\n\"And that made me happiest.\n\"Whenever I get a message from anyone telling me I'm a role model it sets my heart on fire - because that's what I'm working on for my whole life.\n\"I'm still young. I'm aiming to do more and be a good example as a mum.\n\"I hope my daughter will be an Olympian one day. She's a baby Olympian - and maybe she'll be an adult Olympian.\"",

        "article_text": "Despite the hype, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Washington under Donald Trump's second term was a sober, business-first affair - unsurprising for a working visit, which lacks the pomp of a state visit.\nTrump announced expanded US military sales to India from 2025, including F-35 jets, along with increased oil and gas exports to narrow the trade deficit. Both sides agreed to negotiate a trade deal and finalise a new defence framework. \nHe also confirmed the US had approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman accused of playing a role in the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai.\n\"That's a lot of deliverables for an administration less than a month old,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington told the BBC\n\"Overall, both sides seem comfortable continuing Biden-era collaborations, particularly in tech and defence, though many will be rebranded under Trump.\"\nStill, major challenges lie ahead. Here are the key takeaways:\nModi's visit came as Trump ordered that US trading partners should face reciprocal tariffs - tit-for-tat import taxes to match similar duties already charged by those countries on American exports. He ordered advisers to draft broad new tariffs on US trade partners, warning they could take effect by 1 April.\nIndia enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. India cut average tariffs from 13% to 11% in its federal budget in a bid to pre-empt Trump's tariff moves. \nThe jury is out on whether India appears to have dodged tariff shocks for now.\nAjay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI), says he doesn't see any \"problems with tariffs\".\nThe main reason, he says, is that 75% of the US exports to India attract import taxes of less than 5%.\n\"Trump points to extreme outlier tariffs like 150% on select items, but that's not the norm. India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.\nAbhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced.\n\"The devil lies in the details. Reciprocal tariffs won't just mirror India's import taxes -other factors will come into play,\" he told the BBC.\nTrump's approach could go beyond import duties, factoring in value added tax (VAT), non-tariff barriers and trade restrictions. While India's goods and services tax (GST) on imported goods aligns with WTO rules, Trump may still use it to justify higher tariffs.\nA US government memo on reciprocal tariffs hints at this strategy, citing costs to American businesses from non-tariff barriers, subsidies and burdensome regulations abroad. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.\nMr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected under WTO rules. \n\"This will hamper India's ability to prioritise domestic producers, posing a direct challenge to the 'Make in India' initiative. This is certainly not good news for us.\" \nMr Das suggests that India should counter Trump's reciprocal tariff logic, particularly in agriculture where the US imposes strict non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian exports such as stiff maximum residue limits on chemicals. \nHe argues that since the US \"heavily subsidises\" its farm sector, India should highlight these subsidies to push back against American claims.\nTariffs alone may not help bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. Defence and energy purchases will go some way in addressing the deficit, experts say.\nThe new $500bn (\u00a3400bn) trade goal aims to more than double the $190bn trade between the two countries in 2023.\nModi and Trump committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. Talks will focus on market access, tariff reductions and supply chain integration across goods and services.\n\"The announcement that the two sides will pursue a trade deal gives India an opportunity to negotiate for reduced tariffs on both sides. That would be a boon not only for the US-India relationship, but also for an Indian economy that's sputtered in recent months,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nWhat is not clear is what kind of trade deal the both sides will be aiming at.\n\"What is this trade agreement? Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?\" wonders Mr Srivastava. \nMr Das believes we'll have to wait for details on the trade agreement. \n\"It doesn't necessarily mean a free trade deal - if that were the case, it would have been stated explicitly. It could simply involve tariff reductions on select products of mutual interest.\"\nPriyanka Kishore, principal economist at the Singapore-based consultancy firm, Asia Decoded, says $500bn is a \"tall target but there are low hanging fruit we can immediately exploit\".\n\"For instance the US sanctions on Russian shadow fleet are soon going to kick in, so India can easily pivot to the US for more oil. This will not be too difficult.\"\nTrump said at the joint press conference that the US would hopefully become India's number one supplier of oil and gas. \nIndia's defence trade with the US has surged from near zero to $20 billion, making the US its third-largest arms supplier. \nWhile Russia remains India's top source, its share has dropped from 62% to 34% (2017-2023) as India shifts toward US procurement.\nIn a major announcement to deepen defence ties, Trump said the US would increase military equipment sales to India \"by many billions of dollars starting this year\" ultimately paving the way to providing the F-35 stealth warplanes.\nBut this will be easier said than done, say experts.\n\"This sounds good, but it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nDespite rising US arms sales to India, bureaucratic hurdles and export controls limit the transfer of sensitive technologies, he says. The new defence framework announced at the summit may help address these challenges.\nAlso India isn't \"taking the F-35 offer seriously\" due to high maintenance demands, says strategic affairs expert Ajai Shukla. \nShukla notes that US arms deals come with challenges - private firms prioritise profit over long-term partnerships. \nYet with delays and cost overruns affecting some of India's arms deals with Russia, Delhi's defence ties with the US look set to deepen.\nModi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss AI and emerging tech, India's foreign ministry said.\nIt's unclear if they addressed Musk's stalled plans for Starlink's India launch or Tesla's market entry. \nMusk has pushed for direct spectrum allocation, clashing with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who favours auctions. His licence remains under review.\nIndia is also courting Tesla to set up a car factory, cutting EV import taxes for automakers committing $500m and local production within three years. Tesla has yet to confirm its plans.\nIn a rare move, Modi joined Trump at a press conference, answering two questions - on illegal immigration and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) bribery charges against the Adani Group.\nIndian billionaire Gautam Adani, accused of close ties with Modi, was charged with fraud in the US last November over an alleged $250m bribery scheme. \nModi said he hadn't discussed the issue with Trump. On immigration, he stated India was ready to take back verified illegal Indian migrants.\nThis was only Modi's third direct press Q&A in his almost 11-year tenure as India's prime minister. He has never held a solo press conference. In 2019 he sat beside then party president Amit Shah as Shah answered all the questions and in 2023, he took just two questions alongside former President Joe Biden.",

Reciprocal tariffs won't just mirror India's import taxes -other factors will come into play,\" he told the BBC.\nTrump's approach could go beyond import duties, factoring in value added tax (VAT), non-tariff barriers and trade restrictions. While India's goods and services tax (GST) on imported goods aligns with WTO rules, Trump may still use it to justify higher tariffs.\nA US government memo on reciprocal tariffs hints at this strategy, citing costs to American businesses from non-tariff barriers, subsidies and burdensome regulations abroad. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.\nMr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected under WTO rules. \n\"This will hamper India's ability to prioritise domestic producers, posing a direct challenge to the 'Make in India' initiative. This is certainly not good news for us.\" \nMr Das suggests that India should counter Trump's reciprocal tariff logic, particularly in agriculture where the US imposes strict non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian exports such as stiff maximum residue limits on chemicals. \nHe argues that since the US \"heavily subsidises\" its farm sector, India should highlight these subsidies to push back against American claims.\nTariffs alone may not help bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. Defence and energy purchases will go some way in addressing the deficit, experts say.\nThe new $500bn (\u00a3400bn) trade goal aims to more than double the $190bn trade between the two countries in 2023.\nModi and Trump committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. Talks will focus on market access, tariff reductions and supply chain integration across goods and services.\n\"The announcement that the two sides will pursue a trade deal gives India an opportunity to negotiate for reduced tariffs on both sides. That would be a boon not only for the US-India relationship, but also for an Indian economy that's sputtered in recent months,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nWhat is not clear is what kind of trade deal the both sides will be aiming at.\n\"What is this trade agreement? Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?\" wonders Mr Srivastava. \nMr Das believes we'll have to wait for details on the trade agreement. \n\"It doesn't necessarily mean a free trade deal - if that were the case, it would have been stated explicitly. It could simply involve tariff reductions on select products of mutual interest.\"\nPriyanka Kishore, principal economist at the Singapore-based consultancy firm, Asia Decoded, says $500bn is a \"tall target but there are low hanging fruit we can immediately exploit\".\n\"For instance the US sanctions on Russian shadow fleet are soon going to kick in, so India can easily pivot to the US for more oil. This will not be too difficult.\"\nTrump said at the joint press conference that the US would hopefully become India's number one supplier of oil and gas. \nIndia's defence trade with the US has surged from near zero to $20 billion, making the US its third-largest arms supplier. \nWhile Russia remains India's top source, its share has dropped from 62% to 34% (2017-2023) as India shifts toward US procurement.\nIn a major announcement to deepen defence ties, Trump said the US would increase military equipment sales to India \"by many billions of dollars starting this year\" ultimately paving the way to providing the F-35 stealth warplanes.\nBut this will be easier said than done, say experts.\n\"This sounds good, but it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse,\" says Mr Kugelman.\nDespite rising US arms sales to India, bureaucratic hurdles and export controls limit the transfer of sensitive technologies, he says. The new defence framework announced at the summit may help address these challenges.\nAlso India isn't \"taking the F-35 offer seriously\" due to high maintenance demands, says strategic affairs expert Ajai Shukla. \nShukla notes that US arms deals come with challenges - private firms prioritise profit over long-term partnerships. \nYet with delays and cost overruns affecting some of India's arms deals with Russia, Delhi's defence ties with the US look set to deepen.\nModi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss AI and emerging tech, India's foreign ministry said.\nIt's unclear if they addressed Musk's stalled plans for Starlink's India launch or Tesla's market entry. \nMusk has pushed for direct spectrum allocation, clashing with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who favours auctions. His licence remains under review.\nIndia is also courting Tesla to set up a car factory, cutting EV import taxes for automakers committing $500m and local production within three years. Tesla has yet to confirm its plans.\nIn a rare move, Modi joined Trump at a press conference, answering two questions - on illegal immigration and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) bribery charges against the Adani Group.\nIndian billionaire Gautam Adani, accused of close ties with Modi, was charged with fraud in the US last November over an alleged $250m bribery scheme. \nModi said he hadn't discussed the issue with Trump. On immigration, he stated India was ready to take back verified illegal Indian migrants.\nThis was only Modi's third direct press Q&A in his almost 11-year tenure as India's prime minister. He has never held a solo press conference. In 2019 he sat beside then party president Amit Shah as Shah answered all the questions and in 2023, he took just two questions alongside former President Joe Biden.",

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent. There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids!

There was an easy way to do that, by visiting the schools with a track record of bringing through elite players. It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world.

It was one Barrell didn't want to rely on.\n\"When I ran the academy at Saracens, I worked really hard to go to spaces which weren't easy,\" he says.\n\"If you look at the talent system - you don't have to try that hard to see kids in establishments that play rugby.\"\nGenge was an unwitting beneficiary of the draw big rugby schools exert on scouts.\nA Hartpury coach had taken the obvious option one afternoon, watching Collegiate School, then called Colston's, in a pre-season friendly.\nGenge, motivated by a desire to prove himself against Bristol's private school players, turned out for the unheralded opposition and ran amok.\nThat chance encounter led to Genge winning a scholarship which enabled him to live at Hartpury College, finally getting the same \"back garden\" view and rugby immersion as George.\nBy his own admission, Genge's catching and passing were behind his peers when he arrived at Hartpury.\nBarrell says that isn't surprising. Or, necessarily, a problem.\n\"Rugby has a huge advantage in that it is a later-developing sport,\" he says.\n\"There is a real myth in rugby - no-one can look at a 15 or 16-year-old and tell you they are going to be an England player. It is impossible.\n\"If someone says they have got that prediction right, they have probably said it about 500 kids! You have time.\"\nHe says any assessment of rugby talent should come with context.\n\"You need to ask how long a youngster has been playing rugby, how many hours they have trained for, where they are in their physical and cognitive development, what their access to sport is like and what level of parental support they get.\n\"When you stack up those things - all of which can have an impact on perception - you can make better decisions.\n\"That is the reality in any world. Anytime someone turns up for some kind of assessment, all your biases start. The easiest thing is to go for is the polished figure.\"\nOne thing that is hardest to measure is mental strength.\nBarrell was at the RFU when then England head coach Eddie Jones gave an unguarded interview to a Sunday newspaper, claiming private schools didn't develop on-pitch initiative and resilience., external\n\"If you have only been in a system where you get to 15, you have a bit of rugby ability and then go to Harrow, then for two years you do nothing but play rugby and everything's done for you... you have this closeted life,\" said Jones.\n\"When things go wrong on the field who's going to lead because these blokes have never had experience of it?\"\nJones added that English rugby needed to \"blow the whole thing up\" and end its reliance on private schools, hinting success would only come via a system, like in New Zealand, France or the English women's game, in which talent was drawn from a wider section of society.\nJones was part of an outstanding generation of young players at Matraville High School, a state school in Sydney. He played alongside brothers Gary, Mark and Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker, all of whom went on to play for Australia\nThe RFU responded quickly, publicly reminding Jones of the \"valued role\" private schools play in developing talent.\nBarrell, who points out that state school players outnumber those from private schools in England's pathway system before scholarship switches even things up around 16, is cautious about such generalisations.\nHe cites Saracens and England back row Ben Earl, who attended private school and whose parents are in well-paid executive jobs.\n\"I worked with Ben a lot as a kid,\" he says. \"He is fortunate and he would recognise it, but he is also one of the hardest working, toughest, most competitive people you will ever meet.\"\nHowever, Barrell's new position, as chief executive of Greenhouse Sports, , externala charity which delivers sports in some of the most disadvantaged schools in the country, has also opened his eyes.\n\"If your point of difference is having overcome some really tough things at a point where everyone else was having it given to them, those psychosocial attributes are really important,, external\" he says.\n\"Some of the kids I work with now have that in bucketloads.\n\"I have seen kids overcome stuff that others, in a nice school having a fish and chip Friday, would baulk at.\n\"How do we change the system to accommodate kids who bring that?\"\nGenge, who has his own charity working with disadvantaged youth in his native Bristol,, external agrees.\nFor all the coaching and facilities he didn't have, he says his upbringing gave him something vital.\n\"It probably geared me up in terms of attrition and challenge,\" he explains.\n\"My character definitely wouldn't be the same if I hadn't gone through what I went through.

        "article_text": "Ellis Genge and Jamie George (centre, left and right) face down the haka before playing New Zealand this autumn\nJamie George and Ellis Genge have played together for England 57 times.\nAs hooker and loose-head prop, they pack down together.\nThey stand alongside each other when the anthems are sung.\nThey even work together on the board of a players' union, representing the England team in their discussions with the Rugby Football Union and commercial partners.\nThe routes they have taken to this point are markedly different though.\nGeorge's parents were teachers. He grew up living on site at Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire.\n\"I was very lucky,\" he says. \"My back garden was Haileybury College, an absolutely beautiful school with acres of playing fields.\n\"I don't think it could have been a better environment to grow up in when I inevitably became a professional rugby player.\"\nIt wasn't inevitable that Genge would become a professional rugby player.  The teachers at John Cabot Academy - his state secondary school in Bristol - encouraged his rugby. But it wasn't Haileybury.\nThere weren't former Test players as coaches, or strength and conditioning staff, or an extensive fixture list against other rugby-focused schools.\nMost of all, there wasn't the time.\n\"The rugby programme isn't well put together compared to private schools - it might be 30 minutes on a Tuesday as part of PE,\" he says.\n\"I don't think you can hide away from that.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Ipswich host one of the most prestigious schoolboy rugby events in the country every October\nIn 2019,  social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust analysed the background of Genge, George and their England team-mates., external\nIt found that 44% of the England team had, like George, been to fee-paying schools, with the same proportion in the state sector and the rest educated overseas.\nLittle has changed since. If anything, the trend has become more pronounced.\nOf the 23-strong squad picked to face France last weekend, 13 attended private schools.\nOnly 7% of children in England are educated privately, but all budding Georges and Genges, on either side of the divide, know the differences that come with fees.\nYou can see it most starkly every October in Ipswich.\nFor 39 years, St Joseph's College, an independent school on the outskirts of the town, has organised a rugby festival.\nOver those years, it has grown in prestige.\nFuture England internationals Marcus Smith, Zach Mercer, Jonathan Joseph and Lewis Ludlam are among those to have won the player of the tournament award. Chris Robshaw, Mako Vunipola, Mike Tindall and Christian Wade have also trod the turf.\nStreamed online, played in front of hundreds of spectators, it is now perhaps the most sought-after date in the schoolboy rugby calendar.\nBack in 1986, the invitees for the inaugural event came from both the state and private sectors. Increasingly that has become untenable.\nThis year, Royal Grammar School High Wycombe was the only state school among the 16 competing for the showpiece under-18 title.\n\"It is not intentional, it almost organically happens that way because of the resources these schools have,\" says St Joseph's director of sport, Fred Wenham, who must ensure a competitive card for the festival.\nIt is obvious as soon as the teams step off the bus.\nThe vast majority of head coaches who arrive at the festival are recently retired professional players. St Joseph's have recruited Northampton stalwart Mike Haywood to their own staff.\nHis pupils play on immaculate pitches, train in a state-of-the-art gym, review their performance via video analysis, have their sleep and wellbeing tracked, their biometric markers monitored and their nutrition planned out.\nFuture England fly-half Marcus Smith, who attended Brighton College, is awarded the player of the tournament trophy at St Joseph's Festival in 2016\nPerhaps most importantly, there is a huge cultural weight placed on rugby.\nSt Joseph's first team are presented with their festival shirts at a special assembly before singing, some in tears, to the rest of the school.\n\"It really is as close as you can get to a professional experience or lifestyle, without actually being paid for it,\" says Wenham.\nThe RFU has a network of rugby managers to try to embed the game in state schools.\nSixteen of the best compete in the ACE (Academy, Colleges and Education) League. England internationals George Martin, Joe Heyes and Harry Randall all rose up through that route.\nBut, those institutions are thinly spread and tight on resources.\nPrivate schools, where fees can exceed \u00a350,000 a year, will always have more to invest.\nThey are not entirely closed shops, however. You can attend, even if you can't pay.\nBecause top rugby-playing private schools don't just spend on facilities, they also invest in talent, offering highly sought-after scholarships and bursaries which can dramatically reduce fees.\nSo, while England captain Maro Itoje finished his education at Harrow, bumping up the team's percentage of private-school attendees, he arrived there at 16 on a scholarship from St Georges, a state school in Hertfordshire.\nOllie Lawrence and Tom and Ben Curry similarly finished their education in the private sector, after being awarded scholarships.\nSt Joseph's recent success story is Emmanuel Iyogun, who now plays for Northampton and has represented England A. He arrived on a scholarship from Woodlands School, a state school in Essex.\nEngland international Anthony Watson and his former club and country team-mate Beno Obano, who went to Dulwich College on a scholarship at 16, valued such schemes so highly they set up their own, funding Harlan Hines' switch from a state school in south-east London to Marlborough College in 2022.\nA large proportion of England's elite players may emerge out of private schools, but their talent wasn't necessarily born in them.\nThere may be fewer scholarships on offer in the future though.\nSince January, VAT has been payable on school fees.\nThe move, which the government predicts will raise billions for state schools, has put pressure on private schools' registers and balance sheets alike.\nVarious figures in the industry have predicted that scholarships may have to be squeezed.\nAs headmaster of Mount Kelly School, a private school in Devon, Guy Ayling is already making difficult decisions around awards for pupils.\n\"Bursaries and scholarships have a cost attached,\" he says. \"That is the bottom line. They are costs like food, utilities and teacher salaries, and it is therefore something we have to consider.\n\"It is the way of the world moving forward - there is potentially going to be less money in the system and when there is less money in the system, you don't spend as much, including on helping families with financial assistance.\"\nFewer scholarships would mean more kids in George Paul's position.\nThe 23-year-old grew up in Peterborough. He played at Wisbech rugby club, but as he and his ambitions grew in the game, he wanted more rugby than his school would provide.\nHe had a scholarship offer at Wisbech Grammar, a nearby independent school, but with family finances and siblings to consider he didn't take it up.\nInstead, aged 15 and finding his club side weakened as other talented kids switched into the private school system, he chased competitive rugby through a different route.\nPaul launched Advice Academy while he was still a student, attempting to close the gap in coaching and facilities for state-school players\nHe moved to Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, who play in the AOC league, a college-specific league a level below the ACE division.\n\"It is that struggle for state school kids, every one of them will tell you the same story,\" he says.\n\"When we played private schools, it was a motivation. The dressing room would be a very powerful place before those games.\n\"But you would also realise how well drilled they are because they have three or four sessions a week, compared to us having maybe one on Tuesday before playing on Wednesday.\n\"They would have multiple coaches, we would have one.\n\"I know what it is like to turn up at trials at Leicester or Northampton or Scotland-qualified events in random Canterbury kit from SportsDirect when other kids are in full top-to-toe private school branded tracksuits with logos, sponsors and the rest.\n\"They will be in their cliques, they might know the selectors, because they also work at their school. Every state school kid will tell you how daunting that is.\n\"Some people say 'that is what they pay for', and to a degree that is true.\n\"But I don't think there should be that consistency in inequality and lack of opportunity for state school kids that puts them at a disparity when it comes to pushing on in life.\"\nPaul went on to study at Hartpury, playing high-level university rugby, before turning semi-professional in Scotland with Boroughmuir Bears until the Super Six Series they competed in was disbanded last summer.\nAlongside playing, Paul launched Advice Academy, an initiative which worked in state schools in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere to give their pupils the standard of coaching and analysis that is commonplace in the private sector.\nHe is now establishing a high-performance community academy in Peterborough which gives talented young state-school players elite-level training and careers advice on a more regular, consistent basis. \nIt will be free to those for whom cost would be a barrier to attending.\nPaul is dealing with issues that Don Barrell has spent decades wrestling with.\nEducated at a grammar school in Watford, Barrell was a professional for Saracens before becoming the club's academy director and, until last year, the RFU's head of performance programmes and pathways.\nBarrell spent nine years between 2008 and 2017 during his time as academy coach at Saracens \nHis job was to find and develop talent.

        "article_text": "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.\nCheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.\nNow, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.\n\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.\n\"That's what we want.\"\nMr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.\nProductions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.\nThe loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.\nBefore the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.\n\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"\nHollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.\nMany say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA. \nBut studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.\nStudios are, however, very responsive to A-list actors.\nMegastar Vin Diesel helped ensure Universal Pictures would finish filming the latest Fast and Furious movie in Los Angeles.\n\"LA really, really, really needs production to help rebuild,\" Diesel said in an Instagram post.\n\"Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago\u2026 and now Fast will finally return home.\"\nNearly 20,000 people \u2013 including actors Keanu Reeves, Zooey Deschanel and Kevin Bacon \u2013 have signed a \"Stay in LA\" petition urging the state's leaders to temporarily remove caps on production tax incentives for LA County.\nIt's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.\n\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.\nBefore the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.\nHe says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.\nIf passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.\nPresident Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".\nIt's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.\nOn a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.\n\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.\nAlthough he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.\nMs Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.\n\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"\nOthers think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.\nPointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.\nHis once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.\n\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.\nAbout a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.\nShe laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.\n\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.\nMs Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.\n\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"\nDoes she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?\n\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\"",

        "article_text": "A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country.\nThe properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board.\nThe new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion.\nOn 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders.\nThey claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation.\nThe new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.\nBut several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.\nA vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.\nThe tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.\nThe properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.\nThe government says that the waqf boards are among India\u2019s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).\nMuslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. \nBut critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies \u2013 which too requires immediate attention.\nA report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. \nThe committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.\nThe committee also noted that \u201cencroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common\u201d, listing hundreds of instances of such \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d of waqf land by government authorities.\nAccording to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.\nThe amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.\nParliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.\nBut many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.\nMany of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.\nThe 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.\nProfessor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.\n\u201cYou can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,\u201d Prof Rehman says.\nOthers worry that the new bill may not address the community\u2019s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.\nThat's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. \nSome agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. \nBut the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. \u201cThere seems to be an attempt not only to get the state\u2019s control over Muslims\u2019 properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community\u2019s lives.\u201d\nAmong other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf\u2019s claim to a property is valid.\nCritics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.\nThe current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.\nBut some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. \n\"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,\u201d Owaisi recently told reporters.\nThis process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.\n\u201cThe diagnosis may be correct,\u201d Prof Rehman says, \u201cbut the treatment is not.\u201d",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.\nOn Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.\nIn outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.\nWhile big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.\nThe memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days. \nTrump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April. \nTrump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.\n\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".\n\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"\nAs well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports. \nTrump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.\nStill, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"\nIn recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.\nAhead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".\n\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good. \nCountries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nHistorically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium. \nThe US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.\nIn setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US. \nThe White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.\nBut officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax. \nThose kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK. \nDuncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus. \n\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said. \n\nThursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration. \nEarlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil.

It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany of Doge's staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later said he was operating as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation is officially defined as those working for the government for 130 days or less in a year.\nTo some supporters of this new body, Doge's outsider status - as well as its somewhat vague mandate - will increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIts mission, says Musk, is to save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn).\nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nMusk has said he wants to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", what he describes as a fourth branch of government working against Trump's agenda. Critics of his work see a simpler ideological motivation at play.\n\"They are not going to go into agencies that are doing things they like. They are going into agencies they disagree with,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Republican director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), told Reuters news agency.\nIt is unclear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates on what they say has been cut. Among its headline-making actions are:\n\nDoge enjoys broad popular support, a poll by the BBC's US partner CBS News has suggested. \nThis indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - supported its work, even if they disagreed over how much influence Musk should have personally.\nThe size of the permanent workforce currently exceeds two million and one of the largest increases was in 2023, partly due to major investment by the Biden administration in infrastructure projects.\nDavid Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, says Doge's work is needed. \n\"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they asking, whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\"\nPolitical opponents and government watchdogs accuse Doge of acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.\nCritics highlight Musk's potential conflicts of interest, given the billions in contracts his businesses hold with the US government. Trump and Musk deny that any issues will arise.\nMultiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans, and Democrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.\nSeveral times, the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records.\nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Musk said he expected to be scrutinised for his work, but insisted that Americans had voted for \"common sense\" government reform.\nBut pundits question whether he can enact his bold pledges.\nElaine Kamark, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told the BBC that efforts to streamline government spending \"can be done\", highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\nBut she labelled Musk's idea of slashing a third of government spending \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.\nWith additional reporting by Jessica Parker and Cai Pigliucci",

        "article_text": "The number of foreign workers seeking help over claims of exploitation, bullying, underpayment and poor living conditions on UK farms significantly increased last year, the BBC has learned.\nNearly 700 foreign seasonal agricultural labourers complained to the Worker Support Centre (WSC) charity in 2024 they were being treated unfairly by farmers who had brought them over to work, compared to just over 400 in 2023.\nOne former fruit picker told the BBC more must be done to protect migrants from being treated like slaves.\nThe UK government said it always took \"decisive action\" if abusive practices were found on farms.\nBolivian Julia Quecano Casimiro came to the UK on a seasonal worker visa to pick cherries for Haygrove, a Herefordshire-based farm business.\nMs Casimiro is currently taking the company to an employment tribunal over claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination and underpayment of wages, and now campaigns for better protection for seasonal farm workers.\nIn an initial ruling, the Home Office found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Ms Casimiro could have been a victim of modern slavery.\nShe told the BBC she feared the true scale of exploitation of workers was a \"hidden problem\", adding: \"Many seasonal workers continue to have their rights violated at this very moment.\n\"What is happening is very serious because we don't have access to any assistance or support.\n\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"\nA spokeswoman for Haygrove said Ms Casimiro's discontent was prompted by a discrepancy in the face value of flight tickets and the amount loaned to workers for the tickets, and lower than typical hours of work available in the month of July, as a result of extraordinary weather conditions. \nThe company added that her allegations are \"materially incorrect and misleading\" and that it has \"never had accusations of this nature before in the history of our business\". \nIt told the BBC that its practices \"are routinely audited by a range of third-party bodies, including by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), the Home Office, the British Retail Consortium, Red Tractor/Assured Produce, LEAF, Soil Association and SEDEX\".\nThe company said Ms Casimiro worked at Hayford for 11 days before leaving with a free air ticket home, and her claims were based on a \"short-lived, snapshot, atypical experience\".\n\"We take great care in ensuring fairness and equality in our recruitment and working processes,\" the spokeswoman added.\nThe company said it is also co-operating with a nationwide GLAA investigation into how companies recruited 20 Indonesian workers.\nLast summer, those workers claimed they were charged illegal fees to come to the UK by recruitment agencies abroad.\nThe Haygrove spokeswoman said: \"We are deeply concerned by claims that Indonesian workers were charged illegal fees by recruitment agents, which is strictly against our policy and principles.\" \nShe added that the company took any allegations of misconduct \"very seriously\" and had \"co-operated fully with investigations by the GLAA\".\nHaygrove is \"committed to fair employment practices and the wellbeing of all our workers\", she said.\nThe government's seasonal agricultural worker scheme will see 43,000 visas made available for the horticulture industry and 2,000 for poultry farms this year.\nA survey carried out early last year by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) found 91% of respondents reported a positive experience working on UK farms.\nHowever, the WSC, which works to prevent abuses of marginalised workers, said it dealt with a rise in complaints about the scheme during 2024.\nOne man, from Kyrgyzstan, who worked on different farms in England and Scotland on and off over three years, told the WSC he had been expected to live in poor conditions, been discriminated against and been unfairly dismissed.\nThe worker, who wanted to remain anonymous to protect future job opportunities, told the BBC through a translator that he felt standards had got worse over that time and farm employers did not care about workers' wellbeing, or level of pay.\nThe WSC said its caseworkers dealt with 158 farm labourers in one month last summer and referred 19 cases involving 101 individuals to enforcement agencies. The workers were mainly Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek.\nThe charity wants a review of the seasonal agricultural worker scheme and of any risks of exploitation it presents.\nA Home Office spokeswoman said its staff had visited 318 farms and carried out more than 2,100 worker interviews, with improvements made every year to stop exploitation and poor working conditions.\n\"We will always take decisive action where we believe abusive practices are taking place or the conditions of the route are not met,\" she added.\nThe National Farmers' Union said overseas workers were \"invaluable\" to British farmers, who \"take employee welfare extremely seriously and are continually adapting the way they operate to provide the best experience for workers\".\nA spokeswoman added that the vast majority of workers have \"a good experience in the UK which results in many returning to the same farms season after season\".",

The workers were mainly Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek.The charity wants a review of the seasonal agricultural worker scheme and of any risks of exploitation it presents.A Home Office spokeswoman said its staff had visited 318 farms and carried out more than 2,100 worker interviews, with improvements made every year to stop exploitation and poor working conditions. \"We will always take decisive action where we believe abusive practices are taking place or the conditions of the route are not met,\" she added.The National Farmers' Union said overseas workers were \"invaluable\" to British farmers, who \"take employee welfare extremely seriously and are continually adapting the way they operate to provide the best experience for workers\".A spokeswoman added that the vast majority of workers have \"a good experience in the UK which results in many returning to the same farms season after season\".UK fruit picking like prison, says migrant workerScience & EnvironmentUK farming \"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.",

        "article_text": "A year into their relationship, Jess and Nate got engaged next to the sea. \"It was a golden, sandy beach \u2013 empty and secluded,\" says Jess, 26. \"It was just us two there, so it was really intimate.\"\nExcept that the couple were actually hundreds of miles apart \u2013 and they were role-playing their engagement in the video game World of Warcraft.\nNate, 27, was living just outside London \u2013 and Jess was in Wales. After meeting briefly at an esports event in Germany in March 2023, the pair developed a long-distance relationship, playing the game together \"from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to bed\", says Nate.\nThe couple still play the game daily, even though they've been living together in Manchester since March 2024. And they know other couples who have found their partners through video games: \"It's a different way of meeting someone,\" says Jess. \"You both have such a strong mutual love for something already, it's easier to fall in love.\"\nNate agrees. \"I was able to build a lot more of a connection with people I meet in gaming than I ever was able to in a dating app.\"\nNate and Jess are not alone. According to some experts, people of their generation are moving away from dating apps and finding love on platforms that were not specifically designed for romance.\nAnd hanging out somewhere online that's instead focused on a shared interest or hobby could allow people to find a partner in a lower-stakes, less pressurised setting than marketing themselves to a gallery of strangers. For some digital-native Gen Zs, it seems, simply doing the things they enjoy can be an alternative to the tyranny of the swipe.\nSince it first appeared with the launch of match.com 30 years ago, online dating has fundamentally altered our relationships. Around 10% of heterosexual people and 24% of LGBT people have met their long-term partner online, according to Pew Research Center.\nBut evidence suggests that young people are switching off dating apps, with the UK's top 10 seeing a fall of nearly 16%, according to a report published by Ofcom in November 2024. Tinder lost 594,000 users, while Hinge dropped by 131,000, Bumble by 368,000 and Grindr by 11,000, the report said (a Grindr spokesperson said they were \"not familiar with this study's source data\" and that their UK users \"continue to rise year over year\").\nAccording to a 2023 Axios study of US college students and other Gen Zers, 79% said they were forgoing regular dating app usage. And in its 2024 Online Nation report, Ofcom said: \"Some analysts speculate that for younger people, particularly Gen Z, the novelty of dating apps is wearing off.\" In a January 2024 letter to shareholders, Match Group Inc - which owns Tinder and Hinge - acknowledged younger people were seeking \"a lower pressure, more authentic way to find connections\".\n\"The idea of using a shared interest to meet someone isn't new, but it's been reinvented in this particular moment in time \u2013 it signals a desire of Gen Z,\" says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at Warwick University whose research focuses on the digital technologies of romance.\nAccording to Danait Tesfay, 26, a marketing assistant from London, younger people are looking for alternatives to dating apps, \"whether that be gaming or running clubs or extra-curricular clubs, where people are able to meet other like-minded people and eventually foster a romantic connection\".\nAt the same time that membership of some dating apps appears to be in decline, platforms based around common interests are attracting more users. For instance, the fitness app Strava now has 135m users \u2013 and its monthly active users grew by 20% last year, according to the company. Other so-called \"affinity-based\" sites have seen similar growth: Letterboxd, where film fans can share reviews, says its community grew by 50% last year.\nAnd just as in the pre-internet age, when couples might have met at a sports club or the cinema, now singletons are able to find each other in their online equivalents.\n\"People have always bonded over shared interests, but it's been given a digital spin with these online communities,\" says Luke Brunning, co-director of the Centre for Love, Sex, and Relationships (CLSR) at the University of Leeds.\n\"It's increasingly difficult to distinguish between behaviour that's on a dating app and dating behaviour on another platform.\"\nHobby apps are taking on some features of social media, too: in 2023, Strava introduced a messaging feature letting users chat directly. One twenty-something from London explains that her friends use it as a way to flirt with people they fancy, initially by liking a running route they've posted on the platform. Strava says its data shows that one in five of its active Gen Z members has been on a date with someone they met through fitness clubs.\n\"[Online] fitness communities are becoming big places to find partners,\" says Nichi Hodgson, the author of The Curious History of Dating. She says a friend of hers met his partner that way, and they're now living together.\nThe same appears to apply to Letterboxd, too. With users including Chappell Roan and Charli XCX, it's a popular platform for younger people - two-thirds of members in a survey of 5,000 were under 34.\nThe company says it's aware of several couples meeting through the app, including one who bonded over a shared love of David Fincher's opinion-dividing 2020 drama Mank. \"It could be that seeing other people's film tastes reveals an interesting aspect of themselves,\" says Letterboxd co-founder Matthew Buchanan.\nSo what might be driving this? While dating apps initially appeared to offer \"the illusion of choice\", and a transparent, efficient way to meet partners, the reality for many has often proven to be different. The Pew Research Center found that 46% of dating-app users said their experiences were overall very or somewhat negative.\nThe recent decline in user numbers might also be a response to the way some apps are structured \u2013 in particular, the swipe feature for selecting potential partners, launched by Tinder in 2013 and widely copied.\nIts creator, Jonathan Badeen, was partly inspired by studying the 1940s experiments of psychologist BF Skinner, who conditioned hungry pigeons to believe that food delivered randomly into a tray was prompted by their movements.\nEventually, the swipe mechanism faced a backlash. \"Ten years ago, people were enthusiastic and would talk quite openly about what apps they were on,\" says Ms Hodgson. \"Now the Tinder model is dead with many young people \u2013 they don't want to swipe any more.\"\nAccording to Mr Brunning, the gameifying interface of many dating apps is a turn-off. \"Intimacy is made simple for you, it's made fun in the short term, but the more you play, the more you feel kind of icky.\"\nThe pandemic may have had an impact, too, says Prof Brian Heaphy at the University of Manchester, who has studied dating-app use in and after the lockdowns: \"During Covid, dating apps themselves became more like social media \u2013 because people couldn't meet up, they were looking for different things.\"\nAlthough that didn't last after the pandemic, it \"gave people a sense that it could be different from just swiping and getting no responses \u2013 all the negatives of dating-app culture,\" says Prof Heaphy.\nAnd in that context, the fact that video games or online communities like Strava or Letterboxd aren't designed for dating can be appealing. By attracting users for a broader range of reasons, there's less pressure on each interaction.\n\"Those apps aren't offering a commercialised form of romance, so they can seem more authentic,\" says Prof Heaphy.\nIt's a type of connection free from the burden of expectation. A different couple who met on World of Warcraft \u2013 and go by the names Wochi and PurplePixel \u2013 weren't looking for love. \"I definitely didn't go into an online game trying to find a partner,\" says Wochi.\nBut although initially in opposing teams, or guilds, their characters started a conversation. \"We spent all night talking until the early hours of the morning, and by the end of the night, I'd actually left my guild and joined his guild,\" says PurplePixel. Within three years, Wochi had quit his job and moved to the UK from Italy to be with her.\nAccording to Ms Hodgson, \"While some dating apps can bring out the worst behaviours, these other online spaces can do the opposite, because people are sharing something they enjoy.\"\nBecause of these structural elements, she doesn't think the recent decline in numbers is temporary. \"It's going to keep happening until dating apps figure out how to put the human aspect back.\"\nThe dating apps aren't giving up without a fight, however. Hinge is still \"setting up a date every two seconds\", according to a spokesperson; Tinder says a relationship starts every three seconds on its platform and that almost 60% of its users are aged 18-30. In fact, the apps appear to be embracing the shift to shared-interest platforms, launching niche alternatives including ones based around fitness, veganism, dog-ownership or even facial hair.\nThey're also evolving to encourage different kinds of interaction. On Breeze, users who agree to be set up on a date aren't allowed to message each other before they meet; and Jigsaw hides people's faces, only removing pieces to reveal the full photo after a certain amount of interaction.\nIt means that it's premature to proclaim the death of the dating app, believes Prof Heaphy. \"There's now such a diversity of dating apps that the numbers for the biggest ones aren't the key indicator,\" he says. \"It might actually be a similar number to before, in terms of overall membership.\"\nAnd there's a downside to people going to more general-interest apps looking for love \u2013 people might not want to be hit on when they just want to talk about books. Dating apps, at least, are clear about what their purpose is.\nIn an increasingly online world, the solution to improving relationships might not simply be to go offline. Instead, apps that can offer an experience which more closely mirrors the best of IRL interactions, while tapping into the possibilities of digital ones, might also show a way forward.\nWith the imminent integration of AI into dating apps, we are \"right on the cusp of something new\", says Mr Brunning. \"It's interesting to see if we'll end up with specific apps just for dating, or will we end up with something a bit more fluid?\"\nHe points to platforms in China that are more multi-purpose. \"People use them for chat, for community, and conduct business on them \u2013 they can also be dating platforms, but they're often not exclusively for that.\"\nIn the meantime, the interactions possible in less mediated communities like World of Warcraft could offer more of a chance to connect than conversations initiated by a swipe.\nJess and Nate's in-game engagement on the beach might not have been real, but the couple are hoping to change that soon. \"It's a matter of when, really. There are a few things we need to tick off the checklist, and then she'll be getting her ring,\" says Nate. And there'll still be a gaming element.\n\"You can role-play getting married,\" says Jess. \"So it could be funny to get all our friends together at some point in the World of Warcraft cathedral, and we could have a marriage ceremony.\"\nAdditional reporting by Florence Freeman\nTop image credit: Getty\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The coolers, which cost between $80 (\u00a363) to $140, were sold on Amazon and on Igloo's site as well as at Costco and Target from January 2019 to 2025, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.The tow handle can pinch people's fingertips against the cooler, causing amputation and other crushing hazards, the agency said. In total, 12 people reported experiencing fingertip amputations, bone fractures and lacerations from using the handle, which the Consumer Product Safety Commission said customers should stop using right away. About 1.06m of the 90 quart Flip & Tow Rolling Coolers in the US as well as 47,000 in Canada and 23,000 in Mexico were recalled. They were encouraged to contact Igloo for a replacement handle.",

        "article_text": "YouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep secret.\nYouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch?\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users \u2013 almost one in three people on Earth \u2013 and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths.\nIf we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history.\nHow many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you.\nExperts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created \u2013 a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas \u2013 is operating in the dark.\nIn part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time.\nYou might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret.\nA Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue.\n\"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\"\nBut Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example.\nSo, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet.\n\"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\"\nSo, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video.\nWhen the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is.\nThe first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos.\nZuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.\nFor many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals.\nOnly 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe.\nThose with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images.\nThe top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long.\nYouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" \u2013 but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\".\nThis narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says.\n\"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\"\nYouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\"\nGoogle is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\nBut YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says.\n\"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\"\nThe most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the chancellor's online CV, and the use of expenses while working at a bank, in the wake of a BBC News investigation.\nRachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.\nIt was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nSir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter. \nThe initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.\nWe have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.\nA spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.\n\nBBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP\nIn a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.\nThe prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".\nHe said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.\nShe posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"\nRachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.\nThe chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.\nOn the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.\nHowever, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.\nThey said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.\nSpeaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.\nAsked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"\nThe Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.\nReeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006\nThe rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.\nA photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.\nA former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.\nIn a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"\nIn a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\" \nShe said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.\nThe claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".\nAs she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nLast year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.\nReeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.\nShe stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.\nThe chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.\nIn fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".\nThe bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.\nA compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.\nReeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.\nShe then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.\nThe MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.\nHer LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".\nIt had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank but she instead held a management role in the bank's Customer Relations department, which dealt with complaints.\nIn November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.\nThe prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.\nThe spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".\n\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.\nIf you have any information on stories you would like to share with the BBC Politics Investigations team, please get in touch at politicsinvestigations@bbc.co.uk",

        "article_text": "Cologne are top of the German second division after winning their past three league games\n\"It's chaos,\" says German football journalist Mark Lovell, when asked to describe the 2. Bundesliga title race this season - and he is right.\nWith 13 games remaining in this campaign, the battle for the two automatic promotion places - plus the single play-off spot against the 16th-placed Bundesliga side - in the German second tier is the most engrossing race in European football this season.\nJust six points separate the top six after 21 matches, with 10 points between the top 10 in the 18-team league. Seven sides have led the division and more than a quarter of games have ended in draws.\nThe clubs involved come from every walk of German football life too. \nCurrent leaders Cologne are Bundesliga regulars who suffered relegation last season, and have defied a two-window transfer ban which ended in January to achieve their lofty rank.\nThe top 10 of the 2. Bundesliga table after 21 games\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nCologne sit two points ahead of former European Cup winners Hamburg, spending their seventh-straight season in 2. Bundesliga having previously never been relegated from the top flight, and four-time national champions Kaiserslautern.\nFor Kaiserslautern, this season is the latest step in a remarkable recent history which saw them fall into the third tier in 2018 for four years amid financial hardship, before a recent recovery and even reaching the German Cup final last season.\n\"They just barely scraped by one year and right now they're on the rebound,\" George Brown, founder of the American Kaiserslautern Fan Club, tells BBC Sport.\n\"Kaiserslautern has a population of just under 100,000. Towns of this size in Germany normally have a stadium of about 12,000 [but] they have a stadium of almost 50,000. They believe that their place is up at the top level in the Bundesliga.\"\nA further three points back are Magdeburg, the only side from the old East Germany to win a European trophy \u2013 the 1974 Cup Winners' Cup \u2013 but who have never played in the Bundesliga.\nMost remarkably of all, all nine of their league wins this season have come in away games, their 10 home matches delivering seven draws and three defeats.\nThere are other contenders too. Fortuna Dusseldorf, who missed out on promotion last season after throwing away a three-goal lead in the play-off, have led the league for longer than any other side and sit fifth. Just below are recognisable names like Hannover and Nuremberg, not forgetting SV Elversberg who are spending just their second season at this level \u2013 yet led the division as late as matchday 16.\nMagdeburg are in promotion contention after winning nine of their 11 away league games this season\nAnd for the final ingredient, add an average attendance of more than 30,000 fans per game. This is boosted by huge crowds at former Champions League sides Hertha Berlin and Schalke, though they are 13th and 14th respectively, and more concerned about relegation.\nSo yes, it's chaos \u2013 but why is it so close?\nAccording to Lovell, a key factor is money \u2013 but unlike its English counterpart it is  a lack thereof, rather than an imbalanced abundance.\n\"It's not distorted like the Championship is with these parachute payments coming down, Premier League clubs being rewarded for failure with these huge lumps of cash,\" he says.\n\"In German football, they do have a better TV deal then they've had historically but it is nothing like the Championship. It is quite a struggle to get back immediately to the top flight.\n\"Look at Hamburg. Former European champions, Kevin Keegan [as a former player], they were the reason I got interested in German football, they were historically one of the biggest clubs in Germany and very proud of their record of never being relegated from the top flight. \n\"They were termed the dinosaur because they were never going to get relegated but that fate happened and they haven't been able to get back.\"\nRobert Stokowy, a former Cologne native who is now part of the FC Cologne Supporters USA group, says this title race is the result of smaller, well-run clubs colliding with monoliths experiencing tougher times.\n\"There's pressure from below, and there's pressure from the first division,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"Cologne are an elevator team. Last season we just got beaten badly, and if you look at the Bundesliga right now you have such a discrepancy between how much money teams have, and there's just no way that that is a healthy and interesting competition.\n\"What we have [in 2.Bundesliga] is a couple more investors, so some of the clubs from the third division get picked up and all of a sudden they get elevated \u2013 look at the rise of Heidenheim and Union Berlin.\n\"I think the second division is the sweet spot because there is some TV revenue, there's an interesting mix of clubs from the first division who had glory days back then, and you have the ones who come up from the lower leagues.\n\"It is an example of what you can do if you run your club well.\"\nHamburg spent 55 straight seasons in the Bundesliga before their current seven-year stint in the second division\nThat excitement has drawn in the spectators and Marco Fuchs and Maike Baensch, chair and deputy of The Supporters Karlsruhe, say membership has tripled.\nKarlsruhe however are one of the victims of such a fickle league as a run of four winless games has sent them tumbling from second to 10th.\n\"It's a difficult situation,\" says Baensch. \"You want people to be engaged in the league, enjoying every game but at the same time it's frustrating and demoralising to think that you're right up there and then all of a sudden you're back in mid table.\"\nNo fan or club, Brown says, can be confident in predicting what the season will hold in the final 13 matches. \n\"All the conversations that I've seen are incredibly cautious,\" he says. \"One of the things that everybody always says is you don't ever talk about a promotion until you get 40 points. The theory is no team has ever been relegated that had 40 points or more.\n\"But it certainly has made every single match incredible. It doesn't matter if you're the home or away team, it doesn't matter if you're playing the last place team or the first. You have no idea what you're going to get and that just builds excitement and drives people to the stadium.\n\"I wouldn't advise people to gamble on this league because you just never know what's going to happen,\" adds Lovell. \"Top can beat bottom, and just because you were in the Bundesliga last season doesn't guarantee anything.\"",

        "article_text": "As tensions between the US and Canada rise, a tiny puffin-filled island has become emblematic of a larger conflict about where one nation ends and another begins.\nOn Christmas morning, Anthony Ross woke up on an island at the point where the Gulf of Maine meets the Bay of Fundy. Outside, the wind whipped across the frozen brown grass, blowing snow in drifts against the lighthouse while waves lapped the rocky shore. In the next room, his older brother Russell was already awake and keeping a watchful eye on the sea.\nIt was not exactly how one pictures a family holiday, but for the lighthouse keepers of Machias Seal Island, it would have to make do. Once the helicopter lands on this 18-acre hunk of rock between the US and Canada, there is no going home until the end of the month.\n\u201cYou are away from home for 28 days at a time; that is the hardest part. But you get used to that,\u201d said Russell, who has been a lighthouse keeper for about 20 years.\nLuckily, Russell and Anthony came prepared with turkey, presents and beer \u2013 all anyone needs for a nice Christmas day. After decorating the tree and calling their families back home in Nova Scotia, the brothers tucked into a roast dinner.\n\u201cIt was a pretty good Christmas, all around,\u201d Russell recalled.\nLocated smack-dab between the Canadian province of New Brunswick and the US state of Maine, Machias Seal Island is the last contested land territory between Canada and the US \u2013 but that may soon change.\u00a0\nIn recent weeks US President Donald Trump has called the US-Canada border an \"artificially drawn line\" and even threatened to annex the entire nation. And as Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada have sent economic shockwaves through North America, this unassuming 20-acre island has become somewhat emblematic of the rising tensions between the neighbours and longtime allies.\nThe story of the dispute goes back more than 200 years. During the War of 1812, Great Britain (now Canada) and the US each laid claim to the land and the waters that surrounded it. Although the island is far too small and remote to be permanently settled, it was strategically located in the middle of a valuable shipping route, near Grand Manan Island, and neither country wanted to give it away.\u00a0\nIn 1832, Britain built a lighthouse on the island to physically stake its claim. Since then, Canadians have been living there, helping keep sailors away from its rocky coastline and protecting the land from both human and natural foes.\nThat is where Russell and Anthony come in. As lighthouse keepers on the island, they are part of a long line of watchmen manning Canada\u2019s frontier in the Atlantic Ocean. While most of the lighthouses in Atlantic Canada have closed, the government has kept this one open \u2013 in part to keep its claim on the rock.\n\u201cThe opportunity we have to be here, to stay on here and man the island, it is important,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThere are not many light-keepers left.\u201d\nNeither brother works full-time \u2013 union rules say that part-time keepers can only work three month-long shifts a year. But one full-time position may be opening up, and both Russell and Anthony want to go for it.\n\u201cMay the best man win,\u201d Anthony said with a smile.\nBoth brothers have been doing this long enough to know the island\u2019s rhythms: the way it fades from emerald green to dusty brown with the seasons; how the puffins swoop and cackle when they spot a fish in the water; and how the lobster boats emerge from the horizon just after sunrise.\n\u201cThe boats are fishing right in the cove there \u2013 you can see all the fishermen,\u201d Russell said. \u201cI have been here long enough that they know my name now, they know my voice on the [radio], and they know me too.\u201d\nRussell and Anthony also play a role as unofficial ambassadors for the island, greeting American and Canadian tour boats that dock during the summer, when the island turns into a seabird sanctuary. They treat everyone the same, no matter their nationality, offering the birdwatchers a hand onto the slippery, seaweed-covered boardwalk.\n\u201cThe birds do not care; they do not know the difference,\u201d said Russell of the US-Canada border dispute\nAs island guardians, Russell and Anthony play an important role in protecting the thousands of seabirds \u2013 Atlantic puffins, common murres, Arctic terns and razorbill auks \u2013 that nest here during the summer.\nThey help deter gulls that would prey on the young chicks, and also fend off one of nature\u2019s biggest homewreckers: man.\nAs one of the largest seabird colonies on the East Coast \u2013 and the most diverse \u2013 the island is protected by Canadian Wildlife Services, which limits the number of tourists allowed on the island at any one time.\nOnly two tour boats, one from Maine and one from New Brunswick, are allowed to land each day on the island\u2019s dock. With just 15 passengers per load, spots fill up fast. By early April, both boats have usually sold out for the entire birdwatching season, which runs from June to the first week of August.\nThose lucky enough to score a spot must make their way to either the island of Grand Manan in New Brunswick or to Cutler, Maine, where the boats are docked. It can be tricky for the vessels to land on the narrow and rocky shores of Machias, and bad weather can easily cancel a long-awaited trip. But if the seas are fair, adventure-seekers may see a pack of seals sunning themselves on a rock during the boat ride (which is two hours from Maine and 1.5 hours from Grand Manan), or even spot a whale.\nOnce on the island, tourists are restricted to boardwalks to keep them from stepping on a puffin burrow. The skittish birds like to avoid the human interlopers, so people crowd into wooden sheds called blinds, where they can observe the pigeon-sized, tuxedo-wearing birds undetected.\nThe hassle is worth it, according to Dr Tony Diamond, who has been running the University of New Brunswick\u2019s Atlantic Laboratory for Avian Research (ALAR) since 1995.\n\u201cIt is the only seabird colony in the whole of the East Coast where the general public can actually come on shore and get a close-up look of the birds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unmatched.\u201d\nIn May, thousands of puffins flock to the island to dig their burrows and lay their eggs. Once the eggs have hatched, mama and papa puffin take turns guarding the chicks and going out into the sea to bring back dinner.\nThis process, which can last until about August, attracts birdwatchers, scientists and wildlife photographers from around the world.\nDuring the summer, three researchers from ALAR live on the island full-time to track and monitor the birds\u2019 breeding season. It is a unique experience that helps scientists like Mark Dodds get a sense of not only the individual species, but how the ocean as a whole is doing.\nIt is like a little snapshot into the life of a bird,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThrough them you get a really good look at the ecosystem.\nBut it is not the puffins of Machias Seal that have historically led the US and Canada to fight \u2013 it\u2019s what lurks in the ocean just beyond the island. Over the past decade, the price of lobster has about tripled, with fishermen able to command about CAD$4 (\u00a33) a pound for their catch wholesale. On a good day, a lobster boat can easily earn thousands of dollars.\nThat makes the contested waters around Machias, nicknamed the \"grey zone\", a veritable goldmine. Neither country wants to relinquish rights to fish those waters, so the fishermen have worked out a kind of unofficial truce.\n\u201cMost of the time, if you try and work with them, they will try and work with you. But if you want to be a push and shove, you are going to be pushed and shoved back,\u201d said Donald Harris, a fisherman from Grand Manan, a Canadian island of about 2,500 people located about an hour and a half, or 32km (20 miles),\u00a0away\u00a0by boat from Machias.\nOn a lazy August afternoon, Harris and a couple of other fisherman are working on their boats out by the Grand Manan pier, taking it easy before the autumn season kicks in. Practically everybody on Grand Manan is a fisherman or knows someone who is \u2013 the industry is the lifeblood of the community.\nThe lobster boom is evident everywhere you go in Grand Manan, from houses decked out with fresh coats of paint to boats laden with the latest gear.\n\u201cLots changing. There\u2019s a lot more people over here right now, there is a lot more stuff to do right now \u2013 our community\u2019s getting better all the time,\u201d said fisherman Dane Lynton.\nThe \u2018grey zone\u2019 has only added to their wealth. Although the Canadian lobster season officially ends in June, in 2002 the government decided to allow year-round lobster fishing in the 700-sq-km\u00a0(270-sq-mi) \u2018grey zone\u2019. It has helped tide many a fisherman over in the off season, and helped grow the lobster boom in Grand Manan even more.\n\u201cThat is just making money before we make more money,\u201d Lynton said.\nBut while many maintain that current regulations are enough to keep the fishery from being overfished, some are worried that the sky-high prices, driven by market demand in Asia, will prove too great a temptation.\n\u201cMan can ruin anything, right? And greed will ruin a lot of things too,\u201d Harris said.\nAlthough everyone is flush with cash for now, Harris has been around long enough to have seen the fortunes of the village go up and down with the tides, depending on what the catch is.\n\u201cUsually Mother Nature looks after herself, but I have been around long enough. I have seen how the herring went, and the groundfish and the scalloping,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have only got lobster to rely on, and everybody is pounding so hard at the \u2018grey zone\u2019\u2026 it is all going to affect it sooner or later.\u201d\nThis story has been updated from its original publication to reflect recent events.",

Honda-Nissan multi-billion dollar merger collapses2 days agoJo\u00e3o da Silva & Annabelle LiangBusiness reporters, BBC NewsGetty ImagesThe Japanese car-making giants aimed to combine their businesses to compete against Chinese rivalsMerger talks between Honda and Nissan have collapsed after the firms failed to agree on a multi-billion-dollar tie-up.The Japanese carmakers, along with junior partner Mitsubishi, had aimed to combine their businesses to fight back against competition from rival firms, especially in China.The merger would have created an auto group worth $60bn (\u00a348bn), and the world's fourth-largest by vehicle sales after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai.The companies said they would continue their partnership on electric vehicles.Karl Brauer, an analyst from online research platform iSeeCars.com, said the failure of the merger was not a total surprise. \"What comes next?Without the possibility of a Honda merger to ease its troubles, Nissan continues to face an uncertain road ahead.A possible powerful investor has already emerged, however, with Taiwan's Foxconn, which produces most of the world's advanced computer chips, saying it will consider buying Nissan shares for \"co-operation\".Foxconn chairman Young Liu said the firm was interested in collaborating with Renault, the French car giant that has a 36% stake in Nissan after rescuing it from the brink of bankruptcy in 1999.Renault chimed in on the Honda-Nissan fallout on Thursday, calling the terms of the proposed deal \"unacceptable\".Any future deal for Nissan, according to the analyst Karl Brauer, will need to rely on leadership \"that can identify and execute synergies across both companies, as well as manage the political and cultural challenges\".Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. \"Otherwise we will be beaten.",

        "article_text": "From raw eggs to protein shakes, those hoping to expand their brawn are often encouraged to ingest vast quantities of protein. But how much is really necessary and what's the best way to consume it?\nSophia\u00a0Moulson, 21, a fitness influencer based in West Sussex, began taking fitness seriously at the age of 19, after struggling with being overweight.\n\"I often turned to food as a source of comfort, which ultimately left me in a cycle of negative self-image and low confidence. One day, I realised that I needed to take control \u2013 not just for my physical health but for my mental wellbeing too,\" says Moulson.\nInitially, she joined the gym with the sole intention of losing weight. But over time, she fell in love with the process of building up a healthy amount of muscle too. \"I discovered how empowering it felt to grow stronger, and each small strength milestone motivated me to keep pushing forward,\" she says.\nAn integral part of Moulson's progress was research on nutrition. That's when she learned about the importance of protein for building muscle. However, as a vegetarian, Moulson initially felt that she was struggling to get enough protein through just her diet, so she turned to protein powders. \"While it was possible for me to meet my needs through a well-balanced diet, it often required time and careful planning. Protein powders offered a convenient solution, especially with my busy lifestyle,\" she says.\nWhile in the past, bodybuilders were notorious for consuming vast quantities of steak and drinking raw eggs, today, protein powders and tailored diets are big business. But do we really need so much protein to grow stronger? And what is the best way to consume it?\nLinea Patel, a\u00a0Sports Dietitian at the company Pure Sports Medicine in London, explains that proteins have many roles in the human body. As they are digested, the proteins in food are broken down into amino acids \u2013 building blocks that can be rearranged to form any protein that the body needs. Haemoglobin, enzymes, muscles, the keratin in our skin and hair \u2013 there are more than 20,000 proteins in the human body, performing a wide range of functions.\nHowever, the amount that each person needs can vary greatly, depending on their age, body composition and lifestyle.\n\"In the UK, the government guidelines say that the general baseline for sedentary adults is that they should consume 0.8 or 0.75g\u00a0[around 0.03oz] of protein per kg of their own body weight,\" says Patel. \"So, for example, if somebody weighed 70kg [154lb], then you just multiply that by 0.8 and you'll get 56g [around 2oz] of protein a day.\"\nMost people get more than that amount from their normal diets. In the US, the average American consumes around 14-16% of their total calories as protein. However, if you're more active, your protein requirements may exceed 1g per kg each day. The amount of protein you need also depends on factors such as your age, because people tend to lose muscle mass as they get older \u2013 consuming more protein can help us to hold onto more muscle. Post-menopausal women also have higher protein requirements.\n\"What I see in my clinical practice, particularly because I work with women in the menopause or high performing individuals [sportspeople], is that perhaps that they're not eating enough protein for their level of activity or to maintain [appropriate] muscle mass for their stage of life,\" says Patel. One size doesn't fit all, she explains.\nFor individuals engaging in regular high-intensity resistance training or athletes and powerlifters or body builders, research has found that the daily\u00a0protein\u00a0requirement is approximately 1.6-2.2g (0.06-0.08oz) per kg of body weight to maximise muscle\u00a0protein\u00a0synthesis.\u00a0\nMany medical professionals recommend that people acquire the protein they need from their diets, wherever possible. For vegans, this can involve consuming more nuts, seeds and soya-based products, as well as pulses such as beans and lentils. For vegetarians, eggs, yoghurt and certain types of cheese can be added, while omnivores may also want to increase their consumption of meat and seafood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor many, consuming enough protein involves experimenting with different foods. However, not everyone has the time or money to acquire adequate protein through their diet alone.\u00a0\n\"Even though, theoretically, one can meet this target through a balanced diet rich in\u00a0protein-dense foods like lean meats, eggs, dairy and legumes, for many this may not be easy without supplementation,\" says Cyriac Abby Philips, a liver specialist at the Rajagiri Hospital in Kerala, India.\nLauren Manaker a dietician based in Charleston, South Carolina in the US, adds that protein powders \"do provide a convenient and portable option, especially for individuals with busy lifestyles or limited access to whole food sources\".\nGlobally, the protein powder market has been valued at $4.4bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2021, and is expected to grow to $19.3bn (\u00a315.6bn) by 2030. There are many formulations \u2013 both animal and plant-based, in the form of shakes, or added to nutrition bars, yoghurts and ready meals.\n\"When I incorporated plant-based protein powders into my diet, it became much easier to hit my protein goals\u2026 Over time, I experimented with different options and found that lean protein powders or whey protein worked best for me, as they are low in calories but high in protein,\" says Moulson.\nHowever, protein powders can come with risks, and there's some evidence in rats that they could lead to liver damage in those who are not exercising. There have also been rare cases of toxicity to the liver from whey and soy-based protein powders in humans.\u00a0\nProtein powders can also be misleadingly labelled and may contain harmful contaminants. For a recent study, Philips and colleagues from India and the US analysed protein powders sold in India. The team found that many powders contained more or less protein than they were marketed as having \u2013 leading to concerns about \"protein-spiking\" \u2013 as well as contaminants including heavy metals, fungal toxins and herbal extracts that may be toxic to the liver.\nToxins in protein powders may be more widespread than we think.\nIn 2018, a nonprofit group called the Clean Label Project, based in Broomfield, Colorado, released a report about toxins in popular brands of protein powders in the US. Researchers screened 134 products for 130 types of toxins and found that many protein powders contained heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury), bisphenol-A (or BPA, which is used to manufacture plastic), pesticides, or other contaminants with links to cancer and other health conditions. Some toxins were present in significant quantities.\nFor example, one protein powder contained 25 times the allowed limit of BPA in the US. The pesticides and chemicals came from agricultural residue and from the packaging of these powders, researchers observed. Interestingly, one certified \"organic\" product had twice the contaminants of non-certified ones. Plant-based protein powders were the most contaminated, while egg and whey-based powders were found to be the cleanest.\nBecause protein powders are considered dietary supplements and not pharmaceuticals, regulation from governing authorities tends to be more relaxed \u2013 in the US and the UK, they're considered food. This has led to concerns that they are not being regulated strictly enough.\nWhen increasing body muscle, it's not impossible to get your protein requirements through the foods you eat, but it can take considerable time and planning. The key to achieving your daily requirements is to eat protein at every meal and to plan your meals around a principal source of protein, says Patel.\n\"We're looking to aim for at least 20-30g (0.7-1.1oz) of protein per meal,\" says Patel. That would be the equivalent to a couple of eggs or some Greek yogurt with nuts sprinkled on top, or a chicken breast, or a piece of tofu that is the size of your fist.\n\"So, for example, you might have to have two eggs on sourdough toast with some avocado with some seeds sprinkled on top \u2013 with the eggs being the principal protein, the food source with the highest protein content,\" says Patel. \"In a meal that consists of beans or lentils with some rice, the lentils would be the principal protein.\"\nIf you decide to take a protein supplement instead or as well as altering your diet, there are a few simple rules for choosing one that is least likely to contain harmful substances. First of all, prioritise high-quality\u00a0proteins with minimal additives, says Philips.\n\"One must definitely avoid 'blended'\u00a0proteins\u00a0with herbal components as the risk of adulteration, contamination inclusive of the presence of heavy metals and fungal toxins are higher in these types of\u00a0protein\u00a0supplements,\" he says.\nManaker also advises that consumers do their research, particularly to avoid unnecessary ingredients. \"Look for protein powders that contain high-quality ingredients and have minimal additives, fillers or artificial sweeteners. Opt for brands that prioritise transparency and provide detailed information about the sourcing and processing of their ingredients,\" Manaker says.\nManaker also recommends considering the source of the protein in the powder. It's important to check labels to see if it's from whey, casein, soya, plant or animal-based proteins, she says. \"Choose a protein source that aligns with your dietary preferences, allergies or sensitivities.\"\nIf you're taking a protein supplement or powder, timing can play a role in optimising its benefits, says Manaker. \"Consuming protein within 30 minutes to an hour after a workout is often recommended to take advantage of the body's heightened ability to absorb and utilise nutrients during this time,\" she says.\nAnd the way you take protein powders matters. While protein supplements can be beneficial, it's crucial to avoid relying solely on them as a source of nutrition. \"Whole, nutrient-dense foods should form the foundation of your diet, and supplements should only complement a well-balanced eating plan. Avoid the temptation to replace meals entirely with protein powders, as this can lead to an inadequate intake of other essential nutrients,\" says Manaker.\nWith widespread access to protein powders and protein-rich foods today, some people do consume more protein than what they probably need, says Manaker. For example, while the average adult needs around 45-56 grams (1.6-2 ounces) of protein per day, in the UK people tend to consume around 75-100 grams (2.6-3.5 ounces). \u00a0While it is essential for muscle building and overall health, consuming an excessive amount of protein intake can have potential risks.\n\"High protein intake over a prolonged period can put strain on the kidneys,\" says Manaker. \"Individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions should be particularly cautious.\"\nFurthermore, a sudden increase in protein intake, especially from protein powders, can sometimes lead to digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas and constipation. \"Keep an eye on the way your body reacts, even as you tweak your protein [intake],\" says Patel.\nKeep in mind that it's easy to go overboard with protein powders. \"As a general guideline, I wouldn't recommend that people using protein powders exceed 80g [2.8oz] a day,\" says Patel. \"Even 80g of protein from protein powder is excessive for most people. It's going to completely displace whole foods that provide vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that we need. So in general, for most of my clients I tell them to stick with 20 to 40g [0.7-1.4oz] of protein powder per day.\"\nIn particular, problems tend to arise when one's diet is laser-focused only on proteins, says Patel. Micronutrients from fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates, which are also vital for a balanced diet, can end up being neglected.\nIn order to optimise your diet while weight training, ensure that you're including quality carbohydrates and prioritise micro-nutrients like Vitamin D, magnesium, iron and Omega 3 fats. \"They're all essential for optimum muscle contraction, bone health and energy. Eat fruits, vegetables and include oily fish in your diet at least once a week,\" says Patel.\nGetting enough protein is key to growing stronger muscles, but it's only one of the pillars of wellness, says Patel. \"The other pillars are physical activity, getting the training right and sleeping well,\" she says.\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The team found that many powders contained more or less protein than they were marketed as having \u2013 leading to concerns about \"protein-spiking\" \u2013 as well as contaminants including heavy metals, fungal toxins and herbal extracts that may be toxic to the liver.Getty ImagesGram for gram, soybeans contain more protein than eggs (Credit: Getty Images)Toxins in protein powders may be more widespread than we think.In 2018, a nonprofit group called the Clean Label Project, based in Broomfield, Colorado, released a report about toxins in popular brands of protein powders in the US. The key to achieving your daily requirements is to eat protein at every meal and to plan your meals around a principal source of protein, says Patel.",

The email noted that those who declined the offer could not be given full assurances that their jobs would not be eliminated.\nThe unions also said there was no guarantee that those who took the offer would get a full eight months of pay because Congress, which appropriates such funds, had not approved government funding beyond mid-March. \nAfter initially granting an injunction pausing the program, Judge O'Toole said that the unions do not have the \"required direct stake\" in the issue to challenge it in court.\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the ruling.\nIn a statement, AFGE National President Everett Kelley called the ruling a \"setback\" but said that the union's lawyers were assessing next steps.\n\"We continue to maintain it is illegal to force American citizens who have dedicated their careers to public service to make a decision, in a few short days, without adequate information, about whether to uproot their families and leave their careers for what amounts to an unfunded IOU from Elon Musk,\" he said.",

A bit of a throwback. The place was boiling hot all night. It was an incredible atmosphere.\"\nAnd in those few words, Moyes summed up the special magic of Goodison Park.\nIt may be creaking in parts, but on fiery nights like this with Liverpool as the opposition, it literally rocks - parts of it really do - with a glorious support and naked hostility like few other places in world football.\nEverton may have that state-of-the-art new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock ready to go next season, but it is an almost impossible task to replicate what they have in this place - ramshackle and old-fashioned in parts admittedly, hence the need to move.\nGoodison Park was never going to go quietly, but this was something else - full of emotion, passion and all the wild scenes of indiscipline Moyes called \"to-ing and fro-ing\" after the final whistle.\nIt may have pillars blocking some of the views, but it still has so much that will be missed with its towering Main Stand and the criss-cross designs on the stands that are the trademark of famous Scottish architect Archibald Leitch.

        "article_text": "What happens when we make friends across borders? Two writers talk about their British-Italian friendship \u2013 and the fascinating cognitive science on such cross-cultural bonds.\nDavid Robson, London: Aristotle famously described friendship as having \"one soul dwelling in two bodies\", but what are the challenges of stretching that bond across countries?\u00a0\nHaving explored the psychology of social connection in my most recent book, I find that my conversations with my own acquaintances can become rather meta \u2013 in the sense that I now often talk to my friends about friendship. I was particularly interested to hear the thoughts of my Italian \"sister\" Alessia Franco, who lives in Palermo in Sicily, on the joys of befriending someone from another country.\nAlthough certain psychological barriers can make it harder to establish a rapport with someone from a different background, the research suggests that these cross-cultural and cross-linguistic connections also bring some unique benefits \u2013 a fact that we have experienced in our own friendship.\nAs friends and frequent co-writers, it seemed natural to put our (metaphorical) pens to paper and explore the topic in depth. I'll leave it to Alessia to start.\nAlessia Franco, Palermo: Across one's professional life, a journalist encounters hundreds of people. The number clearly depends on the type of work one does, whether we feel the need to be present for every story, all the time, or whether we wish to alternate between moments of observation and moments of introspection. But we rarely expect to form a lasting connection with the people we encounter.\nI first met David in one of Sardinia's remotest villages to record a series of short films exploring the forces behind its residents' extraordinary longevity. David was the host, and I was the producer. We had every reason to believe that, after our job was done, we would each return to our individual lives in London and Sicily without any further contact.\nOne of the first things I appreciated was David's willingness to \"take one for the team\". I am teetotal, and yet the Sardinians that we met had the habit of offering us their homemade wine as if it were coffee. To refuse would have been bad manners, but David was always ready to help me finish my glass without our hosts noticing.\nThis secret complicity was the first step on the path to our friendship. It was only a few months after the work was finished that we got back in touch, however. I can't remember which of us was the first to make the call, but after very little time we started to brainstorm ideas for future projects. We soon recognised how well our interests complemented each other. I am a cultural journalist and storyteller, who writes magical realism novels. David is a science communicator, who tries to find sense in the world through data and analysis.\u00a0\nTogether, we have covered such diverse subjects as the mysterious disappearance of the Island Ferdinandea; the shipwrecks rewriting world history; the secret of the Montessori method and the challenge of how to help children raised in Mafia families. Throughout these projects, we have come to feel more like siblings than colleagues.\nFrom our appearance, it's hard to imagine two more improbable \"siblings\": unlike me, David is long-limbed, blond and blue-eyed. But our sense of kinship can be found in the novels we read: our shared love of Virginia Woolf, Anna Maria Ortese and Zadie Smith. We each feel that literature is a part of who we are and it is also central to our friendship.\u00a0\nDavid: I couldn't have said it better myself (though few English people would consider my hair to be blond). Despite the physical distance \u2013 we have spent fewer than two weeks in the same location together \u2013 Alessia lies at the very centre of my social circle with just a handful of other people.\nThis may be surprising given that we don't share all of the seven pillars of friendship \u2013 seven factors that can deeply shape the closeness of social bonds, according to research by Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford. Having the same language or dialect, and growing up in the same location, are two of these crucial factors. Alessia and I don't share a mother tongue, and grew up in very different places, the UK and Italy.\nWe do however tick the five remaining boxes on Dunbar's list: having similar educational history or profession; the same hobbies and interests; the same world view (an amalgam of moral, religious and political views); the same sense of humour; and the same musical taste.\u00a0\nAs Dunbar explains in his book Friends: Understanding the Power of our Most Important Relationships, most people's social networks stretch to around 150 people \u2013 and someone's position within that network depends on the number of pillars supporting your relationship. People may share just one or two pillars with those on the outer fringes of their social circle, compared to six or seven with those lying at the core.\u00a0\nHowever, despite us scoring only five out of seven pillars, my bond with Alessia is very close. Does that mean some factors in Dunbar's list are more important than others? Research on the importance of pursuing shared activities for maintaining a friendship may help answer that question.\nOne of Dunbar\u2019s studies explored how family relationships and friendships change with our circumstances. The researchers followed a group of school leavers as they embarked on their first year at university \u2013 a time when we might expect a rapid transition of their social circle. As you might expect, regular conversation \u2013 either face-to-face or remotely \u2013 predicted which friendships were most likely to endure, but just as important were joint activities. Persevering on the same task appears to build a stronger sense of unity than talk for its own sake.\nThose joint tasks don't necessarily involve being in the same location, as our experience shows. Whenever Alessia and I write together, there is a unique satisfaction to bouncing ideas off each other and then perfecting our text for publication \u2013 and I am sure that this helped to cement our bond.\nBut there is also another, perhaps more fundamental emotional experience we've had as friends, one which research suggests is the most important basis of any social relationship: a sense of \"shared reality\". This is the perception that the other person thinks and feels and interprets events in broadly the same way as us \u2013 that they understand us, have the same visceral reactions, and experience the world in the same way.\u00a0\nMaya Rossignac-Milon, a psychologist at the University of Navarra, Spain recently devised a scale to measure this core element of social connection, by asking people to rate, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) statements such as:\u00a0\nThe higher people score these statements, the greater their overall commitment to their platonic or romantic relationship.\nDespite some momentary misunderstandings that inevitably arise while speaking each other's language, our conversations are filled with many such moments. In our experience, friendship can easily surmount linguistic barriers.\u00a0\nFriendship special\nAmid the loneliness epidemic blighting many parts of the world following the pandemic, the BBC looks at how friendships can enrich our lives \u2013 and the science-backed ways to boost our social connections:\n\u2022\u00a0How to forge friendships to improve your life\n\u2022\u00a0Why we become better friends as we age\n\u2022\u00a0What we can learn from friendship 'break-ups'\nAlessia: There is an old Italian saying that \"proverbs are the wisdom of the people\". The Sicilian realist novelist\u00a0Giovanni Verga\u00a0often put them in the mouths of his characters: fishermen, farmers and small landowners who used these axioms to make sense of reality and to comfort us from life's uncertainties.\nUnfortunately, this cultural knowledge is often expressed in stereotypes. As a southern Italian, I should be lazy but shrewd. As an Englishman, David should be cold, calculating and unfeeling. I had never personally believed these crude generalisations, and my friendship proved me right. He is warm and caring\u00a0\u2013\u00a0more than many Sicilians \u2013 and I am fastidiously punctual, more so \u2013 David assures me \u2013 than most English people.\nBy now, we have both stepped into each other's worlds. I am happy to have discovered London with him. We took trips to sites in London associated with the life of Virginia Woolf, and visited Kensington Gardens, where\u00a0J M Barrie's Peter Pan\u00a0mocked adults and helped the lost children. I went to sleep savouring the fog and the cold \u2013 which, as a Sicilian, I should hate \u2013 while hugging a hot water bottle bought for me by my English brother.\nIn Palermo, I dragged David through\u00a0the hustle and bustle of the Capo market, full of fried street food, multicoloured fruit and loud voices. We lost ourselves in the mosaics of the\u00a0Palatine Chapel.\u00a0I told him the history of the Sicilian puppet theatre at the\u00a0Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino, where I am head of public communications; and we immersed ourselves in the\u00a0graffiti of the Steri, the prison cells where heretics were held during the Spanish Inquisition.\nThese visits are few and far between, but we are often in contact through WhatsApp and Instagram. Writing can often be a solitary profession \u2013 shut within a room in a kind of monastic silence, as we try to crystallise our thoughts after months of research. But I can say with certainty that sharing our experiences has offered an antidote to this loneliness. Knowing that someone dear to you is wandering through the same kind of interior world is a profound comfort.\nDavid: Cross-cultural friendships may often lack the natural reference points that ease our interactions with people of our own background, but they do have the advantage of creating a sense of self-expansion. This is the sense that we are growing as people, and while you might expect this to be important for our life-satisfaction \u2013 as individuals \u2013 studies by Arthur and Elaine Aron at the State University of New York at Stony Brook show that it is also fundamental for our social relationships.\nSelf-expansion can come in many forms. It may come from an exposure to new points of view, or an introduction to new and exciting experiences that we had never encountered alone. As Alessia describes, we are constantly learning from each other.\nStretching our minds in this way may fuel greater creativity. Friendship, in general, tends to be associated with more original problem-solving, as each individual within our social circle introduces us to new ideas and viewpoints that we may not have come across before.\nThis may be especially true for connections across countries, since those people will be drawing from a different well of cultural knowledge and beliefs. Even if we are not directly inspired by the words they say, our interactions may have helped to loosen some of the shackles on our thinking so that we are more receptive to new ways of viewing the world \u2013 a more flexible and open-minded attitude that encourages innovation.\nSuch benefits can be seen in an international study on innovation and cross-cultural friendship led by Jackson Lu at the MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The researchers surveyed 2,226 repatriates in 96 countries, people who had previously worked in the US and then went back to their own countries. For evidence of innovation, the researchers considered whether the participants had started their own business as an entrepreneur, or whether they had introduced some profound change to practice in their existing workplace. The people who had continued to maintain their American friendships were more likely to show both signs of creative thinking, compared to those who did not.\nMost of us would not choose our friends solely for the cognitive benefits that they provide, of course \u2013 those are just happy by-products of our interactions. We are friends for the sheer pleasure of someone's company and the meaning they give to our existence.\nThanks to the incredible advances in communications, we do not need to be in the same physical location to experience someone's continued presence in our lives. According to recent studies, many people underestimate the value of video calls and text messaging for maintaining our social bonds \u2013 and these false assumptions may lead our long-distance friendships to fade. Any contact is better than none, provided that we use these tools to affirm our mutual care and understanding. I think that's worth remembering when we read opinion articles decrying the effects of these new technologies on our lives. It all depends on the ways that we apply them.\nOne hundred and fifty years ago, Alessia and I may have posted letters outlining our thoughts and feelings on the events of the day, but we would have endured weeks of delay. Today, we can respond to each other's messages within seconds. In those moments, the distance between London and Palermo feels negligible.\u00a0\nI was lucky to meet Alessia in Sardinia all those years ago, but plenty of websites and apps now offer anyone the possibility of forging cultural or linguistic exchanges.\u00a0 There has never been a better time to build bridges across borders.\n* David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "article_text": "A new exhibition of more than 200 photographs charts 300 years of image-making in the US, showing how the country's history and photography have run in parallel.\nIn 1840, using a self-made copper plate, Henry Fitz Jnr produced one of the world's first selfies, his eyes gently closed to prevent any blinking from spoiling the result. In creating this striking blue image, he was doing more than record his appearance; he was also documenting America's first essays into an art form that would tell its story in radical new ways.\nFitz's self-portrait, along with more than 200 other photographs, chart 300 years of image-making at the Rijksmuseum's newest exhibition American Photography, Europe's first comprehensive survey of this subject. Complemented by international loans, the exhibition showcases, for the first time, the museum's own collection of American images, which it has been busy expanding since 2007.\nFor co-curators Mattie Boom and Hans Rooseboom, the exhibition's starting point was to show the US through the differing perspectives of its photographers. Americans were \"using this medium as we [the Dutch] used painting in the 17th Century,\" Boom tells the BBC. \"America and photography run parallel. The medium is so connected with the country.\"\nThe exhibition has deliberately departed from a \"top 100\" approach, Rooseboom adds, stating \"that would have been too easy\". Instead, works by icons such as Robert Frank, Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus sit alongside mementos, postcards and adverts \u2013 \"surprisingly good images that nobody knows,\" he says.\nA 19th-Century tintype (an image made on a sheet of metal) featuring a man and woman in front of a rustic barn is a case in point. The image was probably sold on the spot by a travelling tin typist \"for a modest price\", explains Rooseboom. \"Many people had just arrived and were living in the countryside, no big city nearby, so this was the only possibility of having your portrait taken.\" The man stands proud, looking at the camera, but the woman's head is bowed and she is looking away. \"Sometimes you can sense that people were simply not used to being photographed,\" says Rooseboom. \"Nowadays, we've seen in magazines and movies how to pose elegantly.\" This may be the only time in their whole life that they would be photographed, and the result, adds Boom, \"would hang on the wall of the house where they lived forever\".\nBy contrast, a 1913 postcard featuring 12,000 employees of the Ford Motor Company in Detroit may have been the \"most expensive picture that was ever taken\", quipped a newspaper at the time, as the factory had to shut down for two hours to assemble the staff. The image, the company boasted, was \"the largest specially posed group picture ever made\" and illustrates a turning point where industry saw the value in investing large sums in promotional photography. Taken in the year when Ford introduced America's first moving assembly line and the US had become the world's largest economy, the photograph also depicts the mass production that would shape the country.\nThe image's reappearance in Ford marketing also made it an early example of photoshopping. While the same tinted faces swarmed in the foreground, the number of employees cited in the caption increased exponentially, and a building to the left was cropped out in one version and acquired extra floors in another. \"Apparently, many photographers and their publishers had no qualms about abandoning their medium's potential for realism,\" write Boom and Rooseboom in the exhibition catalogue.\nA decade on, the New York portrait photographer James Van Der Zee was also embellishing his work, drawing jewellery on to his subjects and retouching their faces to erase dark lines and wrinkles. \"I put my heart and soul into them and tried to see that every picture was better looking than the person,\" he said. As a black photographer working from his Harlem studio at the height of the Harlem Renaissance, his work records a period when black migrants fleeing the segregationist South were forging a new life for themselves in the urban North. For the first time, African Americans and other minority groups could be photographed by someone inside their community, and represented in a way that uplifted them. Van Der Zee's Portrait of an Unknown Man (1938), for example, is carefully posed to suggest confidence. The outfit is elegant and the buttonhole daisy adds a dandyish flourish. It's an image that reflects the aspirations and upward mobility of African-American people and the pride Van Der Zee had in his culture.\nIt is the Chinese-American community that is the focus of the work of Irene Poon, who grew up in San Francisco's Chinatown, where her parents, first-generation immigrants from Guanghzou, ran a herbalist store. A 1965 image features Poon's sister Virginia in a local sweet shop, crowded out by Hershey's and Nestl\u00e9 bars. The letters \"Nest\" peep out from the densely packed shelves, reinforcing a sense that she is enclosed by this mass of graphic lettering. Beside her head a \"Look\" bar competes for attention, hinting at that other ever-expanding role for American photography: advertising \u2212 a sector in which the US was a forerunner. \"Many of the 20th-Century artists started in advertising. It's part of art history,\" Boom says. \"This whole field already existed, and the arts, and photography as an art form, draws from it.\"\nOne of the exhibition's most powerful images, Stars and Stripes Forever? (1970) was created by New York advertising photographer Bill Stettner, who sought to elevate the status of commercial photography, and successfully campaigned for photographers to retain the rights to their work. \"I'd like to think that what I'm doing, which is clearly commercial photography for advertising, is an art,\" he told an interviewer for the 1980s television series World of Photography.\nStars and Stripes Forever?, his best-known work, was originally just a sample, made, he said, \"out of necessity\" to boost his portfolio following a financial downturn. The work takes its name from a patriotic march and features a US flag made from matches that has just caught fire, suggesting, perhaps, the fragility of the US and the principles that founded it. \"Commercial photography is very often overlooked and not collected by museums, but it's a fascinating field pictorially,\" says Rooseboom. \"You find the precursors of Modernism in advertising, but hardly anyone knows about this and [hardly anyone] has been collecting it or showing it in exhibitions.\"\nIn the post-war years, mass immigration to the US brought new ways of thinking. the US took over from Europe as a cultural trendsetter, and photography was eventually accepted as an art form. Playful approaches to photography emerged, moving beyond documenting people and places to provoking emotion and inviting deep questions. Ming Smith's America Seen Through Stars and Stripes (1976), created on the bicentenary of the Declaration of Independence, turns again to the flag inviting America to reflect on its history. By placing a figure in mirrored sunglasses in front of a shop window, she creates a disorientating mesh of reflective surfaces. The grid structure suggests incarceration but \u2013 in combination with the round glasses and the stars on the flag \u2013 also creates an abstract composition reminiscent of modern art. \"She's a careful observer, playing with all these layers in the image,\" says Boom.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Eight vintage photos of the quirkiest US groups\n\u2022 The photos that skewer British peculiarities\n\u2022 Eight photos showing 'death of the American dream'\nSmith explores the artistic potential of photography, experimenting with double-exposure, shutter speed and collage. In one version of this image, she paints on bold red stripes, altering this snapshot of the US with marks that resemble blood or flames. Smith's work builds on the civil rights movement that preceded it and features activists such as James Baldwin and Alvin Ailey. She was the first woman to join the African-American photography collective the Kamoinge Workshop and the first black woman to have her work acquired by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Yet her demographic was largely overlooked by the art world. \"I worked to capture black culture, the richness, the love. That was my incentive,\" she told the Financial Times in 2019. \"It wasn't like I was going to make money from it, or fame - not even love, because there were no shows.\"\nThe political power of photography is also seen in the work of Native American (Seminole-Muscogee-Navajo) photographer Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie who uses the camera to correct misconceptions about Indigenous populations and to offer an alternative viewpoint on US history. \"No longer is the camera held by an outsider looking in, the camera is held with brown hands opening familiar worlds,\" she writes in a 1993 essay. \"We document ourselves with a humanising eye, we create new visions with ease, and we can turn the camera and show how we see you.\"\u00a0\nTsinhnahjinnie's captioning of a touristic image of Monument Valley, Arizona with This is not a commercial, this is my homeland highlights the commodification of American land, and uses what she calls \"photographic sovereignty\" to take us back to the very beginning and reclaim and retell the story of America. In combination with works such as Bryan Schutmaat's Tonopah, Nevada\u00a0(2012), which documents mining's effect on the landscape of the American West, images like Tsinhnahjinnie's tell a story of a beautiful land that means different things to different people: financial gain, security or a sacred space. As the camera has passed from hand to hand, the American stories have multiplied. \"American photography is a much richer and wider field than even we knew,\" says Rooseboom. \"There's still so much to be discovered.\"\nAmerican Photography is at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam until 9 June 2025. The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue American Photography \u2013 America through Photographers' Eyes, by Mattie Boom and Hans Rooseboom.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature. If we aren't, well, we probably don't really believe something is inherently better because it's natural.\nMeanwhile, there are hundreds of things that we might consider not to be natural that, in fact, have made life quite a lot better for many of us. Prior to modern medicine, more than one in 100 women died in childbirth. In wealthy, industrialised countries such as the UK today, it is more like one in 10,000. Before vaccinations were rolled out globally, whooping cough (pertussis) killed one out of every 10 children infected. After the global roll-out, deaths fell to a fraction \u2013 1/157, specifically \u2013 of what they had been before.\nThat's just medicine. Look around you right now, and you'll see a dozen more examples. It's may not be \"natural\" to wear glasses, refrigerate food, or turn on the heating in winter, for example \u2013 but for many of us, it's a better alternative than walking around near-blind, leaving meat to spoil or shivering in the cold.\nMuch of the food we eat does not come to us as nature presents it. We process and cook it. The harvesting, grinding and processing of grains helped to drive the transition of our species from being nomadic hunter gatherers into settled farmers capable of building sophisticated civilisations. So, too, did the way in which we cultivated and cross-bred crops \u2013 meaning that many of the nutritious foods we consider \"natural\" today, from the orange carrot to the modern banana, look (and taste) far different than their wild forebears.\nOf course, it would be wrong to suggest that human-made products don't also cause us problems, whether pollution from synthetic plastics to the use of guns and explosives. Nor does it mean that, in many cases, the more \"natural\" option is not better for us. But it does mean that we cannot assume the more \"natural\" option is better just because it's natural \u2013 despite a frequent tendency for people to believe the contrary. Carrots might be better for us than crisps, but so too is paracetamol versus arsenic.\nSome of these examples hint at one of the other main problems with the \"appeal to nature\" \u2013 how can you delineate what is, and what isn't, natural at all? Humans, after all, come from nature. So, if anything an animal or plant produces is \"natural\", why isn't anything that humans do? And what of those creations that are blends of what we'd traditionally consider natural and man-made \u2013 like vaccinations, which are derived from the parts of a (natural) virus or bacteria, and, when injected, help teach your immune system how to (naturally) fend off that same pathogen in the future?\n\"Like all truly interesting words, 'nature' is a mille-feuille of meanings,\" writes the science historian Lorraine Daston. It can mean almost anything, depending on the context. This slipperiness, of course, is exactly what makes it such clever language for marketing \u2013 and makes it so easy for us to fall for.\nThere's another problem, too: even if there were a clear-cut delineation between \"humans\" and \"nature\", we're often not very good at knowing what is actually synthetic, versus what is not.\nTake brushing our teeth. Is it natural to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste? What about to brush your teeth with a non-fluoride toothpaste?\nFor many of us, our instinct might be to say that brushing with fluoride is unnatural, while brushing with non-fluoride toothpaste is natural. But fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that can be found in soil, water and rocks, while one of its common replacements in \"natural\" toothpastes, nano-hydroxyapatite, is synthetic. And, of course, we'd need to consider that cleaning one's teeth, certainly with the items we use today, is far from natural; the closest primates get to brushing their teeth is \"flossing\" with whatever is on hand (like bird feathers). Even if we wanted to brush our teeth the way that our human ancestors did, we'd need to scrub our teeth with a twig, pig hairs or even porcupine quills.\nMeanwhile, if I told you that I had made a drink for you that was made up of 99% dihydrogen monoxide, would you recoil? This chemical name sounds pretty synthetic, after all, until you think about it.\nDihydrogen monoxide is, of course, two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. You might be more familiar to see it written in chemical shorthand: H2O. In other words, water.\nThe next time you see a product being marketed on the basis that it is natural \u2013 or see someone arguing against something because it is not \u2013 it is worth questioning what is really being meant. And, perhaps, questioning why it is that those behind the product or practice are leaning on the \"appeal to nature\" fallacy to persuade an audience of its merits \u2013 rather than simply laying out the logical argument for just why it is actually the better option.\n* Amanda Ruggeri is an award-winning science and features journalist.

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature.

        "article_text": "The \"very slow-burn\" new series of the satire about a luxury resort is uneven and disappointing.\nLook closely at the opening credit sequence of this season's White Lotus, set at a luxury resort on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand. The camera roves over colourful drawings depicting centuries-old scenes of the landscape and culture, but soon the images of Buddhist shrines and elephants amidst flowered greenery give way to angry monkeys and shipwrecked men being eaten by sea creatures.\nThat ominous pattern reflects the plots of every season of The White Lotus. But unlike the credit sequence and the previous two instalments, the rest of this very slow-burn season doesn't get to the danger nearly fast or vividly enough. A series should never move so slowly that it only begins to take off halfway through. The White Lotus still has writer and director Mike White's fingerprints, and occasionally his iconoclasm and inventiveness. But this uneven iteration feels flabby and elongated, with far less satiric bite.\nAs before, this season starts with an unidentified corpse, after gunshots interrupt a meditation session with the resort's so-called \"health mentor\". So much for the Eastern spiritual calm some of the rich Western travellers might have hoped for. The story then flashes back a week as the guests arrive.\nThe show always skewers the ultrarich while heading toward the murder, so it makes sense that the most intriguing characters are a wealthy financial advisor and his family, even though the jabs at their privilege are toothless. Tim Ratliff finds himself in serious, predictable business trouble back home, but Jason Isaacs makes the character's desperation visceral and urgent. His wife, Victoria (Parker Posey), is a one-note character always zonked out on anti-anxiety drugs.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Instagram wellness guru who faked cancer\n\u2022\u00a011 of the best TV shows to watch this February\n\u2022\u00a0In an age of distrust spy thrillers are booming\nWhite's astute casting often makes the season better than the story suggests, though, and the Ratliff children are especially well played. The middle child, earnest Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), has led the family to Thailand so she can research her college thesis on Buddhism, one of the few plot points that actually has to do with Thailand. The oldest son, Saxon, is a good-looking, sex-obsessed dolt. Patrick Schwarzenegger effectively channels the layers of this bro-guy whose hedonism comes back to bite him. Sam Nivola plays the youngest child, shy high-school senior Lochlan. If you get the unsettling sense that the sexual boundaries in this family are a little too loose, trust your instincts. White provides a twist that is both ick and proof that he hasn't entirely lost his edge or willingness to plumb some dark psychology. The Ratliff brothers' casting might seem to cry nepo-baby because Patrick is Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver's son, and Nivola's parents are Alessandro Nivola and Emily Mortimer. But both are entirely natural and convincing, worth casting on their own.\nIn another smart, unexpected choice, Walton Goggins from Fallout plays the enigmatic Rick, whose garish shirts and unkempt appearance make him out of place at the resort. He seems to be some kind of grifter with a younger, put-upon girlfriend (Aimee Lou Wood). But for once Goggins is not asked to grin wildly, and becomes poignant when Rick's ulterior motive is revealed \u2013 if you believe his story.\nAnd Natasha Rothwell returns as Belinda, the spa manager in Maui in the first season, now in Thailand for job training in wellness. Rothwell has always made the character touching, with a sweet diffident smile that signals how little she expects from life. Here she is used mostly as a plot device, but it's a clever plot full of call-backs to earlier seasons and too spoilery to detail.\u00a0\nBy far the weakest storyline involves three long-time friends on a girls' trip. Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb's roles are shockingly cliched, including jealousy, gossip and a holiday fling with the help. Near the start, Coon gulps a whole glass of wine, typical of the mugging and telegraphing of characters in a thread that is meant to be the most comic but just seems stale.\u00a0\nWith so many possibilities, it's disappointing that the show doesn't use its setting well.

        "article_text": "Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time. \nStarting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings.\nThe collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dal\u00ed's friend and publisher.\n\"Dal\u00ed was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,\" Ms Argillet told the BBC.\nSome of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests.\nDal\u00ed's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. \nIn his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. \n\"Appreciating Dal\u00ed's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,\" Ms Argillet says.\nBringing Dal\u00ed's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition.\n\"The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,\" Ms Aggarwal says. \nStrictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dal\u00ed's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist.\nIn 1967, Dal\u00ed famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers.\nIn return, Dal\u00ed demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed.\nShe finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dal\u00ed had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out).\nDal\u00ed's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality.\nBorn in Spain in 1904, Dal\u00ed grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Andr\u00e9 Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dal\u00ed.\nThe surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by Andr\u00e9 Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was \"dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason\", according to Breton.\nDal\u00ed was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges.\nConsequently, Dal\u00ed's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. \n\"Dal\u00ed was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,\" Ms Argillet says.\nThe artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dal\u00ed revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache.\n\"Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,\" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache.\nIn the same interview, he described his moustache as being \"very gay, very pointed, very aggressive\".\nMs Argillet, who knew Dal\u00ed intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dal\u00ed being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and \"shocking the bourgeois\".\nHe once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover.\n\"At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,\" Ms Argillet says. \nBut she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dal\u00ed's shyness that made him over-perform in public.\n\"He was misunderstood by many.

        "article_text": "Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time. \nStarting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings.\nThe collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dal\u00ed's friend and publisher.\n\"Dal\u00ed was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,\" Ms Argillet told the BBC.\nSome of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests.\nDal\u00ed's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. \nIn his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. \n\"Appreciating Dal\u00ed's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,\" Ms Argillet says.\nBringing Dal\u00ed's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition.\n\"The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,\" Ms Aggarwal says. \nStrictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dal\u00ed's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist.\nIn 1967, Dal\u00ed famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers.\nIn return, Dal\u00ed demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed.\nShe finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dal\u00ed had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out).\nDal\u00ed's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality.\nBorn in Spain in 1904, Dal\u00ed grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Andr\u00e9 Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dal\u00ed.\nThe surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by Andr\u00e9 Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was \"dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason\", according to Breton.\nDal\u00ed was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges.\nConsequently, Dal\u00ed's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. \n\"Dal\u00ed was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,\" Ms Argillet says.\nThe artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dal\u00ed revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache.\n\"Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,\" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache.\nIn the same interview, he described his moustache as being \"very gay, very pointed, very aggressive\".\nMs Argillet, who knew Dal\u00ed intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dal\u00ed being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and \"shocking the bourgeois\".\nHe once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover.\n\"At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,\" Ms Argillet says. \nBut she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dal\u00ed's shyness that made him over-perform in public.\n\"He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dal\u00ed, just like his paintings,\" Ms Argillet says.\n\"The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dal\u00ed.\"\nThe exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March.\nThis article has been updated to reflect that two Dali colour etchings are at Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city.",

        "article_text": "BBC's Discovering the World's Table sees food writer Nick Kwek journey to his ancestral homeland of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo, where he eats pufferfish with the Bajau Laut sea nomads, learns the art of rice wine-making and is given a secret hangover cure.\nPristine turquoise waves lap our boat as we depart the harbourfront in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah's busy state capital, and sail towards a jungle oasis. But it's not an island paradise we're heading for \u2013 in fact we're not touching foot on land at all. Instead, we're destined for a cluster of stilted shacks perched above the water's surface some 7km from the shore. The settlement is home to the Bajau Laut, a nomadic community who live most of their lives at sea.\u00a0\u00a0\nWho better to kickstart my culinary adventure around Sabah with than the Bajau, who eat Malaysia's spectacular seafood for breakfast, lunch and dinner? But first we'll need to catch it. As renowned hunters, they follow the fish, dismantling and rebuilding their makeshift houses as they go, expertly freediving and spearfishing their prey with seemingly supernatural skill.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"They can erect them in as fast as a day,\" says local tour guide, Emily Chin, who has been working with the Bajau and other Indigenous groups for years. \"They're so connected with the sea that they often don't know what to do if they're not on the sea \u2013 it's almost like a third arm for them.\"\nIndeed, their bodies have evolved over the years giving them extra-large spleens that act like a biological \"scuba tank\", allowing them to hold their breath for up to 10 minutes at a time. Meanwhile, my breath has been taken away.\nMeet the expert:\nNick\u00a0Kwek\u00a0is a food writer, presenter and filmmaker who has travelled the world documenting stories for BBC series including Discovering The World's Table, The Travel Show and Click. He's reported for BBC News, ABC and SBS and contributed to leading food and drink publications.\nKwek\u00a0grew up into a family of chefs and bakers, before working in some of Scotland's best bars and restaurants.\nThis is my first time back in my father's homeland, Sabah, in almost two decades. Born and raised in Fife, Scotland, I grew up in my parent's pan-Asian restaurant, surrounded by the billowing smoke of red-hot woks, scorching chilli and fragrant ginger. The exotic flavours and enchanting ingredients of my childhood inspired my passion for food and an insatiable appetite for travel.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo be returning here to discover more about Sabah's traditional dishes, explore its local ingredients and their heritage is an emotional, fantastical experience.\u00a0\nKwek is a Chinese surname, with my father's side part of Malaysia's largest ethnic minority \u2013 the Chinese-Malay community. They live alongside Malays, Indians and Indigenous groups that make up the melting pot that is Malaysia. And it's this uniquely rich cultural diversity that makes for a very special cuisine, bursting with bold, lasting flavours.\nToday\u2019s menu is no different \u2013 the Bajau are treating me to freshly-caught pufferfish, notoriously poisonous if not prepared correctly and usually served on special occasions such as weddings or family reunions. It's boiled with chilli, garlic, turmeric and fresh calamansi juice, a native citrus with the appearance and sourness of a miniature lime but with the sweet zing of clementine orange. The dish is both hot and tangy, with the fish unexpectedly meaty, reminiscent of monkfish.\u00a0\nWhilst cooking, Chin introduces me to a delicacy adored by the Bajau: latok, a type of seaweed, normally eaten raw. Glistening green globes, these mini bunches of \"sea grapes\" pop on your tongue, releasing a salty, juicy, refreshing essence of the sea. This so-called green caviar is gaining popularity across Southeast Asia as a healthy and nutritious snack.\u00a0\nBack on dry land, it's an ingredient celebrated by chef Raphael Lee, of high-end eatery OITOM in downtown Kota Kinabalu. Originally from Sabah, he moved to Melbourne, Australia, to train in refined cooking techniques before returning to introduce a new fine dining concept to the city, catering to its burgeoning middle class and international visitors.\n\"Oitom means 'black' in Kadazan-Dusun [the language of Sabah's largest ethnic group]\", Lee tells me. \"We are championing heritage cuisines through the lens of the culinary world.\" Named in honour of Lee's heritage, the restaurant has a dark-black interior that acts as a stage so his colourful plates can shine.\nToday we're preparing a raw white fish salad called hinava, a traditional cured dish of the Kadazan-Dusun tribes. Akin to ceviche, it comprises grouper, fresh chilli, ginger, shallots, calamansi juice and bambangan (an indigenous wild mango). But Lee's modern take on the classic dish involves homemade kombucha, strawberries foraged from the foothills of Mount Kinabalu and latok.\u00a0\n\"We have around 33 tribes in Borneo and each prepares their hinava differently. Some use vinegar, some use bambangan seed. Food is all about cross-culture, and of course whilst we want to treasure the authenticity of our cuisine, for its growth, it needs innovation as well,\" he says.\nLee's version is delicately presented, with each element tweezered into place and the taste\u00a0is softer, smoother and more complex than the original.\nSeafood is undeniably the star of the show in Sabah. Coastal towns sprawl with fish markets, while restaurants and food courts have tanks teaming with live, freshly caught grouper, crabs, lobsters, prawns and clams. These ingredients play a leading role in the country's signature specialities like the lusciously spicy curry laksa, char kway teoh (a gloriously fatty fried noodle mix) and the iconic butter prawns \u2013 delightfully crispy yet wondrously creamy, served in the shell.\u00a0\nBut as well as sublime seafood surrounding the huge island of Borneo (the third largest island in the world at around 290,000 sq km), inland is another staple of the modern Malaysian diet: rice.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Mandy Yin's Sarawak white chicken\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nPopularised with the arrival of migrants from China, India, Sumatra and Thailand during British colonialism in the 19th Century, rice takes centre stage for the country's national dish, nasi lemak. A meal made of several parts but almost always coconut rice, boiled eggs, cucumber, sambal sauce and tiny dried fish known as \"bilis\". (Try it with beef rendang \u2013 a dry lemongrass and coconut stew \u00ad\u2013 you won't regret it.)\nTwo hours' drive over the hills into the mountain valley of Keningau belies a sea of green fields \u2013 \u00a0pastures of rice paddies as far as the eye can see. Out in the blistering Sun I meet village chief Mami Ita whose family has been growing rice here and making traditional tapai (rice wine) for generations. She welcomes me to her home where she teaches me how it's made.\nWe start by building a fire and boiling rice that's leftover from last year's harvest and has had time to sufficiently harden. \"It's a family activity,\" she tells me, something sacred to bond over. In addition to love, the secret ingredient here is ragi, a yeast formed by hand. The caressing of the yeast helps form its unique flavour profile as the scent and spirit of its handler becomes solidified within. Each family's brew produces its own distinct taste.\n\"You don't touch chilli or lemon for two weeks before handling the ragi,\" warns Mami Ita, whose yeast starter used today was her grandmother's.\nInstead of a wooden barrel, the wine is matured inside a clay pot known as a tajau, but it's left to age without water. Only upon opening a tajau several months later is water added and the newly infused wine ready to drink. Before I sip, Mami Ita lets me in on a secret ritual to keep the hangover demons at bay.\n\"Place your finger into the wine, then touch it against your forehead and then into your belly button and say \"Tuka Tuka!\" To my disbelief, it worked!\u00a0\nTapai is having a moment in Borneo. It's being reimagined at Limau & Linen, a contemporary restaurant and lounge in Kota Kinabalu's upmarket Signal Hill neighbourhood, where proprietor and executive chef Linn Yong mixes rice wine with coconut syrup and pineapple juice before garnishing the cocktail with local mountain flowers.\u00a0\nYong is keen to convey that Malaysia's cuisine is a reflection of its people. She's crafted a dish that honours her nation's diversity yet togetherness: the \"tajau treasure community pie\". A confit of smoked octopus, scallops and shrimp, rice, rice wine and fish stock\u00a0are combined in a tajau and topped with a puff pastry lid. It's a celebration of Sabah's bounty, intended to be enjoyed together.\n\"Behind every restaurant is a community of farmers and customers. For me it's like breaking bread with the people we love,\" says Yong.\u00a0\nAs the pie reaches the table and Yong makes a speech about her creation's genesis, steam rises up around us, filling the room with a warm comforting aroma that brings me home. A befitting finale to our journey of discovery, reconnection and the indelible impact of cultural traditions.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

But most often, people missed out because you blazed through town and went to the next spot.\"\nShe thinks the purpose of using \"Chitlin' Circuit\" as part of the title is to educate people who may not know about it.\nBeyonc\u00e9's previous album, Renaissance explored the forgotten influence of black and queer communities on house music. \nAnd Cowboy Carter, which recently won a best album Grammy, delves further into the history of black American musicians.\nNat says: \"I think it's bringing back something old and making it new again.\n\"This is bringing something to younger generations.\n\"Being able to see your favourite artist play and things like that and really have that bonding and kind of cultural experience.\n\"That's what she's trying to bring back,\" Nat says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Becoming Led Zeppelin is a new authorised documentary that tells the \"untold story\" of the band, who despite achieving global influence and legendary status, are difficult to define.\nRock's mightiest anthems, and the tales surrounding them, tend to be continually replayed \u2013 and sometimes, their power fades over time. Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.We looked at whether there was one act that carried music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin \u2013 Bernard MacMahonThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. \"If anybody across any generation listens to that band you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else \u2013 Phil Alexander\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.Music writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Sony Pictures ClassicsBecoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's story for posterity (Credit: Sony Pictures Classics)In fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.Still, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.",

        "article_text": "Moments in human history are etched into the Earth. Now researchers are piecing together evidence of our impact on the planet \u2013 through the marks we've left on nature.\nThe microbes living in this French harbour have never recovered from World War Two. Between 2012 and 2017, Raffaele Siano pulled sediment cores from the seabed at Brest harbour, wondering what he was going to find. When he and his colleagues at the French Institute for Ocean Science (Ifremer), analysed the fragments of DNA captured in those cores \u2013 they discovered something remarkable.\nThe oldest, deepest layers of sediment \u2013 dating to before 1941 \u2013 had traces of plankton called dinoflagellates that were strikingly different to the genetic traces of plankton left in the shallower, more recent layers. \"There was a group, an order of these dinoflagellates, that was very abundant before World War Two \u2013 and after World War Two it almost disappeared,\" says Siano. He and his colleagues published a study detailing their findings in 2021.\nSiano mentions that Brest harbour had been bombed during the war. Then, in 1947, a Norwegian cargo ship exploded in the Bay of Brest. The disaster killed 22 people and spread ammonium nitrate, a toxic chemical used to make fertiliser and explosives, into the sea. Even younger sediment in the 1980s and 1990s showed further changes in the plankton community in the harbour. \"We correlated this from another type of pollution coming from intensive agricultural activities,\" says Siano.\nNature has a way of remembering things. Echoes of certain human activities, especially highly-polluting ones, sometimes show up in tree rings, coastal sediments and ecosystems. Arguably, these traces are hints of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch in which humanity is said to have irrevocably, and drastically, altered Earth. Human history, it turns out, is written into the very fabric of our planet \u2013 and the life that co-exists here with us.\nSiano and his colleagues are predominantly ecologists but they also work with historians. \"The land changed because of human impact and also because of historical events,\" Siano says. When the team analysed the sediment cores from Brest, they also detected a gradual rise in heavy metal pollution as time passed. Younger layers of sediment contained higher volumes of mercury, copper, lead and zinc, for example.\nThe report notes there were similar levels of some of these metals \u2013 especially lead and chromium \u2013 in Pearl Harbour, a major US naval base in Hawaii that was heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes in 1941. However, Siano adds that he can't be sure whether these metals came directly from the bombs themselves. Either way, there is a signal in both Brest and Pearl Harbour of a calamitous, and polluting, moment in human history.\nOther researchers have also scoured the planet in search of geological records of anthropogenic pollution. In China, soil sediments reveal a sharp increase in metal contamination since 1950 \u2013 which correlates with a rise in air pollution there during the second half of the 20th Century. A separate study explores how the emergence of industries such as shipbuilding may be linked with a higher incidence of heavy metal deposits in tree rings from certain parts of China.\nEven Roman metallurgy, from many centuries ago, has left its mark. One 2022 study found a noticeable rise in lead contamination in ice, sediment and peat cores from Europe, correlated with the development of Roman industry. It is sometimes difficult to be sure which specific events caused spikes in lead contamination, however, note the authors.\nJean-Luc Loizeau at the University of Geneva has studied the sediment of Lake Geneva, particularly the material found in a small area of the lake near to a wastewater treatment plant. He says the sediment there contains many traces of human activities. Crucially, the way water moves around in this part of the lake has helped to preserve such clues.\n\"It accumulates because there is a kind of gyre that keeps the sediment within the bay,\" he says, referring to Vidy Bay, on the northern shores of the lake. In a 2017 paper, he and colleagues describe the heavy metal pollution that became evident here in sediment layers dating to the 1930s. Among the specific examples he gives is a spike in mercury contamination during the 1970s.\n\"We know there was an accident in one of these industries,\" explains Loizeau. \"There was some spilling of mercury because there was a break in a tank and we really find this peak in the sediment.\" Plus, traces of elements such as barium in the cores could be linked to the rise of the automobile, adds Loizeau \u2013 because car brakes often contain barium.\nBesides metals, radioactive materials have also found applications in various industries. In Switzerland, for instance, radium was long used to make glow-in-the-dark details on watch faces. Remnants of radium from the watchmaking industry have turned up in landfill sites and buildings in the country.\nAnd scattered around the globe are pieces of evidence that reveal the grim legacy left by nuclear weapons during the 20th Century. Take the giant craters in the Nevada desert made by huge weapons tests, for example. But some contamination caused by nuclear detonations is much more subtle.\nIn 2019, researchers revealed that some of the grains of sand on beaches near the Japanese city of Hiroshima are in fact particles of debris created when the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city on 6 August 1945, towards the end of World War Two. \"The chemical composition of the melt debris provides clues to their origin, particularly with regard to city building materials,\" the authors wrote. In other words, the bomb turned buildings into dust, heat from the explosion reshaped that dust, and the blast ultimately spread this material across the nearby landscape \u2013 marking it forever.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nRemnants of nuclear explosions are not confined to the outdoors. They may be in your attic, too. Attic dust often lies undisturbed for decades \u2013 unlike urban soil, which is more likely to be disturbed \u2013 so traces of contaminants may remain.\nA study published in 2003 reports the results of a survey of 201 homes in the US state of New Jersey. Among the traces the researchers found there were lead concentrations that roughly correlated with the prevalence of lead in air pollution during the 20th Century. But they also found small amounts of Caesium-137, a radioactive isotope. This was more common the older the property was and could perhaps be explained, the researchers suggest, by the frequency of above ground nuclear weapons tests in the US \u2013 especially during the 1950s and 1960s.\nSiano and his colleagues are now looking further afield in their search for clues of human history embedded in nature. The team has collected more than 120 sediment cores from nine different countries around Europe, with the hope of finding further correlations between historical events and trace DNA or metal contamination left in those cores.\u00a0\n\"We can look for the impacts of the Vesuvius volcano [eruption] in Naples,\" says Siano, noting that the volcano last erupted in 1944. And here, as in other locations, the team may also detect signs of radioactive material ejected during the Chernobyl disaster \u2013 contamination from the accident having spread to over 40% of Europe.\u00a0\nAnd in yet more places, says Siano, evidence of everything from oil spills to the development of oyster farms may have been locked away in the sediment. \"We have all the material to answer these questions,\" he says.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

And here, as in other locations, the team may also detect signs of radioactive material ejected during the Chernobyl disaster \u2013 contamination from the accident having spread to over 40% of Europe.\u00a0\nAnd in yet more places, says Siano, evidence of everything from oil spills to the development of oyster farms may have been locked away in the sediment. \"We have all the material to answer these questions,\" he says.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The Afghan women's team who will not be silenced\n\"Don't do anything until I get back!\"\nMel Jones was in the middle of a television commentary, but she was also in the middle of masterminding an escape from the Taliban.\nThe former Australia cricketer was one of the three women who organised and funded ways for the Afghanistan women's cricket team to flee their country in 2021 in what she said felt at times like \"a Jason Bourne movie\".\nAmong the 19 players who made the terrifying journey to Australia was Firooza Amiri, who shook with fear every time her family were stopped in the car at eight check points they had to pass on the journey out of their home country.\nTo this day, Amiri cannot fathom how their excuses of attending a \"family wedding\" and \"taking their mother to receive medical care in Pakistan\" were believed.\n\"It was the biggest miracle of my life,\" she told the BBC.\nThree and a half years later, she and her team stepped on to the field at the Junction Oval in Melbourne for an Afghanistan Women's XI who were playing their first ever match as another chapter in their remarkable story started.\nAmong those watching on emotionally from the sidelines was Jones, who set up what was dubbed a \"backyard immigration service\" to organise emergency humanitarian visas, money and safe passage for the players and their families.\nConsidering the dangerous journeys they had made, this was to be a day of overwhelming joy for the players who were finally back competing in the sport they love.\nBut the specially designed badge on their kits - rather than an official crest - was a big reminder that their fight to play remains far from over while the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not recognise them as a national side.\nIn a new documentary, 'Cricket's Forgotten Team', the BBC looks into the team's story by speaking with the players and those who played a crucial role in safely evacuating them.\nWatch Cricket's Forgotten Team on BBC iPlayer\nThis video can not be played\n\"I didn't know if we were going to live or die\"\nAmiri had been drinking tea at home with her grandmother in August 2021 when she heard that the Taliban had returned.\n\"In that moment I was shocked and I felt that I would lose everything,\" she said with tears in her eyes, adding that she knew immediately the team would need to leave the country.\n\"My parents lived through the first time that Taliban were in Afghanistan and they knew what would happen to the girls.\n\"I didn't know if I was going to survive. I didn't know if there was going to be a chance for me and my family to get out of Afghanistan, I didn't know if we were going to live or die.\n\"I burned everything, all my certificates, all my medals. There's nothing left.\"\nUnder Taliban laws, women are banned from universities, sport and parks. It is also forbidden for their voices to be heard outside of their homes.\nAmiri's team-mate Nahida Sapan recalled how the Taliban came to her home searching for her.\n\"My brother went outside and one of the Talib asked him, 'Do you know about some cricket girl? We think she lives here.' My brother was very scared. I had a scorebook for all of my team-mates so I went home and ripped all of the paper up and put it in the trash.\"\nSapan, whose brother worked for the previous government, said her family then started receiving calls and messages from the Taliban.\n\"They were direct threats. They were saying: 'We will find you and if we find you, we will not let you live. If we find one of you we will find all of you.'\n\"I was so worried about all of the team girls. We all needed a safe place.\"\nThat safe place was to come from an unlikely source on the other side of the world.\nThousands of miles away, Mel Jones was sitting in quarantine in an Australian hotel during the Covid-19 pandemic when she received a message from an Indian journalist asking whether she had heard about the Afghan cricket team's situation.\nThe players had looked to the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) for assistance after the Taliban took over but received none.\nOn their own, they were terrified under the rule of the hardline Islamist group.\nThe journalist put Jones in touch with one of the players and she asked if there was anything she could do to help. The player replied to say that all her team-mates and the backroom staff needed to get out of Afghanistan.\nJones, who won two World Cups with Australia, then went through her contact book and brought volunteers on board, including her friend Emma Staples, who used to work for Cricket Victoria, and Dr Catherine Ordway, who had helped to evacuate Afghan women footballers.\nCreating a tight network of people who could help, including on the ground in Afghanistan, they organised visas and transport to eventually get 120 people out of the country, mainly into Pakistan and then on military flights to Dubai.

The player replied to say that all her team-mates and the backroom staff needed to get out of Afghanistan.\nJones, who won two World Cups with Australia, then went through her contact book and brought volunteers on board, including her friend Emma Staples, who used to work for Cricket Victoria, and Dr Catherine Ordway, who had helped to evacuate Afghan women footballers.\nCreating a tight network of people who could help, including on the ground in Afghanistan, they organised visas and transport to eventually get 120 people out of the country, mainly into Pakistan and then on military flights to Dubai.

        "article_text": "The Uzbekistan government is on an ambitious tourism drive \u2013 but is sparring with heritage experts over how to protect its historical sites.\nThe sound of a jackhammer rattles through the air. In Bukhara, a former trading hub on the ancient Silk Road in what is now Uzbekistan, tourism is the new commerce and new hotels are popping up on every street corner. I've counted three construction sites in a 100m radius outside the former caravanserai where I'm staying, and I observe the progress of a guesthouse being built just metres from a 16th-Century madrasa (school).\u00a0\nIt's a trend that's visible across the country. In the capital, Tashkent, construction work for a shopping mall lines the avenue leading up to the Hazrati Imam mosque complex, next to the shiny, almost-completed Centre for Islamic Civilisation. The small historic city of Khiva, surrounded by mud fortifications, cannot expand outwards \u2013 but mud-and-straw residences in the historic centre are being knocked down and replaced by modern hotels. It is perhaps most obvious in Samarkand, where billionaire businessman Bakhtiyor Fazilov has poured money into flashy projects to raise his home city's profile, such as a new airline, an international airport that opened in 2022 and the strange Disneyland facsimile Silk Road Samarkand, a soulless and sanitised tourist resort situated outside the city.\n\"The concept of the Silk Road is being applied to everything,\" said Svetlana Gorshenina, a researcher and member of the Uzbek heritage protection association Alerte H\u00e9ritage. \"You have Silk Road restaurants, Silk Road shops, Silk Road tours, tourist agencies uniquely dedicated to the Silk Road. It has become our only selling point and it's self-exoticising. It's a kind of self-orientalisation, which is a hangover from colonialism.\"\u00a0\nThe thing is: it's working. The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index now ranks Uzbekistan at 78th out of 119 countries, moving up 16 places in the last five years. The Uzbek government is ploughing investment into its tourism sector after the country's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, laid out his Uzbekistan 2030 strategy in September 2023, an enormous governmental plan detailing the goals to be achieved in various sectors by that date. That includes increasing the number of foreign tourists to 15 million, more than double the 6.6 million visitors to the country in 2023. He has also called for the creation of \"tourist clusters\" \u2013 complexes providing accommodation and other services for tourists in one place.\u00a0\nOne of these new clusters is the reason I've come to Bukhara. It's a 33-hectare site on the fringes of the old town on which a leisure complex called\u00a0Eternal Bukhara\u00a0will soon be built. Samarkand tycoon Fazilov has a hand in this project too: he's the chairman of one of Uzbekistan's largest contractors, Enter Engineering, which is building the complex. The company is cagey about its actual plans for the site \u2013 not least because it has already proven quite contentious.\nInitial plans reported in the local press described it as an \"ethnographic park\" that would recreate traditional Uzbek buildings such as\u00a0chaikhanas\u00a0(teahouses), as well as restaurants serving Uzbek cuisine and a museum about Uzbek culture. But the 3D renderings pasted on the high walls that surround the construction site show instead blocky, modernist shopping arcades and glimmering pools adorned with abstract art.\u00a0\n\"We're not trying to replicate historic buildings. We don't want to repeat history \u2013 but to create something that will have its own impact,\" Rustam Khaydarov, the deputy general director of Enter Engineering, told me, as we sat in a portacabin in the construction site with excavators and diggers whirring nearby. \"It will be a place where people can relax, with cafes and a cultural centre for local artists to display their art. And about 70% of it will remain a green site.\"\nEnter Engineering also plans to build a number of five-star hotels, with up to 700 rooms on site. \"Wealthy people already come to Bukhara but are dissatisfied with the quality of the hotels. So we want to improve the class of hotels on offer,\" he said. There will also be medical facilities to cater to a new type of tourist that Uzbekistan is trying to attract: visitors who come for cheap healthcare, from dentistry to plastic surgery.\nThis area used to be Bukhara's administrative zone, with government offices and a large public sports arena. The demolition of the sports stadium im 2024 provoked a public outcry (which is rare in Uzbekistan, a country where public dissent is swiftly silenced), and Enter Engineering responded by building three more sports facilities on the town's outskirts. The site is ringed by a road, beyond which there are drab and semi-dilapidated residential apartment blocks, with many ground-floor spaces for businesses unoccupied. Although it's just a short walk to Bukhara's tourist sites and monuments, it feels a world away from the relentless tourism of the city centre.\nGet off the tourist trail\nMany travellers head from Samarkand to Khiva but don't hesitate to go off the beaten path. Here are some ideas:\n\u2022\u00a0Rent a car or book a tour to visit the ancient Khorezm fortresses and Zoroastrian sites on the road between Nukus and Urgench, where you can scramble around the desert ruins, poke into chambers and walk along walls that were built between the 4th Century BCE and the 7th Century CE.\n\u2022\u00a0The city of Nukus is a rapidly developing tourist destination, known above all for the Nukus Museum of Art's extensive collection of Russian avant-garde art.\n\u2022 Go to the Fergana Valley for a slower pace of travel. Spending time in a teahouse in a rural mountain village will give you a better understanding of how people live in Uzbekistan.\n\"For years, Uzbekistan has been undergoing a process of emptying city centres of their inhabitants,\" explained Gorshenina. \"We are witnessing a transformation of towns into museum-towns that are made for tourists. In Bukhara, you already have this 'tourist zone' that is clearly separate from the rest of the town where residents live. It's become an open-air museum.\"\nAn Uzbek architect, who did not want to be named for this article but whom I met in his office in Bukhara, told me, \"Every year, there are more and more tourists. I have always thought of Bukhara as a living organism, and that organism is becoming very weak and fragile. It should not become a town solely for tourists but for its residents as well. It risks becoming a Venice in the desert.\"\nAlerte H\u00e9ritage is fiercely opposed to the Eternal Bukhara project, in part because it says that locals were not consulted about the use of the space, and also because of the loss of important Soviet-era architecture, such as a government building that was the former regional headquarters of the Communist Party, built in 1987. It was torn down in early 2024.\nThe Uzbek architect said that the current government was repeating mistakes from the Soviet era. \"The Soviet Union destroyed a lot of heritage and replaced it with Soviet buildings because it wanted to leave its own imprint. That tradition of demolition is still \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 in our blood.\"\nAlthough Eternal Bukhara is not within the historical centre that is classified as a Unesco World Heritage site, it falls within the \"buffer zone\", which still requires Unesco validation before urban changes can be made. When contacted, a spokesperson for Unesco, said that they were \"closely monitoring\" the situation, adding: \"We hope that the authorities will comply with their commitments to the World Heritage Convention and that they will not carry out any demolition/construction project without the prior assessment of the World Heritage Committee in July 2025.\"\nDemolition on the Eternal Bukhara site is visibly ongoing, with only a handful of buildings still standing. That seems problematic for Unesco \u2013 even more so as the international organisation plans to host this year's General Conference in Uzbekistan, which would be the first time since 1986 that the annual meeting has been held outside Paris.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Central Asia's glittering new Silk Road jewel\n\u2022\u00a0 Plov: Uzbekistan's rice dish with 'sexual power'\n\u2022\u00a0 The Silk Road city most tourists miss\n\"Unesco is toothless, without principles. What has it really done for Central Asia, for Uzbekistan?\" asked the Uzbek architect. Both he and Alerte H\u00e9ritage are unconvinced by Unesco's warnings to Enter Engineering. Khaydarov, however, assured me that the company will not launch any building work until they get Unesco's green light \u2013 which means that they could still be waiting for months before construction is able to begin.\n\"We don't want the city's image to be damaged,\" Khaydarov said. \"This is a reputational issue. But we chose this area because it's in the buffer zone and we are confident we will get Unesco's approval to continue.\"\nHe also insisted that locals support the plans, describing it as \"a social project\" rather than a commercial one. \"We will create minimum 15,000 jobs with this site,\" he promised.\nUzbekistan's headlong rush into the world of mass tourism could well create thousands of jobs and boost the country's economy \u2013 but it risks bulldozing or damaging both the country's ancient heritage and vestiges of its more recent history. You only have to walk through Bukhara's covered bazaars that were once filled with Uzbek silk and crafts and are now teeming with imported, mass-produced goods to get a feel for what the country may look like in just a few years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The Uzbekistan government is on an ambitious tourism drive \u2013 but is sparring with heritage experts over how to protect its historical sites.\nThe sound of a jackhammer rattles through the air. In Bukhara, a former trading hub on the ancient Silk Road in what is now Uzbekistan, tourism is the new commerce and new hotels are popping up on every street corner. I've counted three construction sites in a 100m radius outside the former caravanserai where I'm staying, and I observe the progress of a guesthouse being built just metres from a 16th-Century madrasa (school).\u00a0\nIt's a trend that's visible across the country. In the capital, Tashkent, construction work for a shopping mall lines the avenue leading up to the Hazrati Imam mosque complex, next to the shiny, almost-completed Centre for Islamic Civilisation. The small historic city of Khiva, surrounded by mud fortifications, cannot expand outwards \u2013 but mud-and-straw residences in the historic centre are being knocked down and replaced by modern hotels. It is perhaps most obvious in Samarkand, where billionaire businessman Bakhtiyor Fazilov has poured money into flashy projects to raise his home city's profile, such as a new airline, an international airport that opened in 2022 and the strange Disneyland facsimile Silk Road Samarkand, a soulless and sanitised tourist resort situated outside the city.\n\"The concept of the Silk Road is being applied to everything,\" said Svetlana Gorshenina, a researcher and member of the Uzbek heritage protection association Alerte H\u00e9ritage. \"You have Silk Road restaurants, Silk Road shops, Silk Road tours, tourist agencies uniquely dedicated to the Silk Road. It has become our only selling point and it's self-exoticising. It's a kind of self-orientalisation, which is a hangover from colonialism.\"\u00a0\nThe thing is: it's working. The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index now ranks Uzbekistan at 78th out of 119 countries, moving up 16 places in the last five years. The Uzbek government is ploughing investment into its tourism sector after the country's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, laid out his Uzbekistan 2030 strategy in September 2023, an enormous governmental plan detailing the goals to be achieved in various sectors by that date. That includes increasing the number of foreign tourists to 15 million, more than double the 6.6 million visitors to the country in 2023. He has also called for the creation of \"tourist clusters\" \u2013 complexes providing accommodation and other services for tourists in one place.\u00a0\nOne of these new clusters is the reason I've come to Bukhara. It's a 33-hectare site on the fringes of the old town on which a leisure complex called\u00a0Eternal Bukhara\u00a0will soon be built. Samarkand tycoon Fazilov has a hand in this project too: he's the chairman of one of Uzbekistan's largest contractors, Enter Engineering, which is building the complex.

But the 3D renderings pasted on the high walls that surround the construction site show instead blocky, modernist shopping arcades and glimmering pools adorned with abstract art.\u00a0\n\"We're not trying to replicate historic buildings. We don't want to repeat history \u2013 but to create something that will have its own impact,\" Rustam Khaydarov, the deputy general director of Enter Engineering, told me, as we sat in a portacabin in the construction site with excavators and diggers whirring nearby. \"It will be a place where people can relax, with cafes and a cultural centre for local artists to display their art.

        "article_text": "In 1966, the BBC's Tomorrow's World visited a party in New York organised by the electronic dating service Tact, or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing. Around 2,000 singles were invited to Manhattan to try out this modern method of matchmaking.\nIn 1788, a man going by the name of \"AB\" placed New York's first known personal ad in the Impartial Gazetteer, according to historian Francesa Beauman. He was seeking a woman \"under 40, not deformed, and in possession of at least one thousand pounds\". Describing himself as \"a young gentleman of family and fortune, who is lately come to town\", the ad was the Tinder bio of its day. Whether AB had any replies to his ad is unknown. But nearly 200 years later, New York was the home of another novel approach to dating \u2013 computer matchmaking.\nInvented by Bob Ross (a computer programmer at IBM, not the painter), and accountant Lewis Altfest, Tact \u2013 or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing \u2013 launched in New York 60 years ago, in 1965. First confined to the Upper East Side, it soon expanded to the entire city and had thousands signing up to be matched by computer. Each hopeful had to pay $5 (\u00a32) and fill in a questionnaire, which would then be used to match people \"on three levels\", according to Ross: socio-cultural factors, opinions and values, and psychological factors. The answers were fed into the computer, which would then spit out supposed matches of the opposite gender. Same-sex dating was not an option. \"Tact is not a lonely-hearts club,\" Ross told the BBC's Tomorrow's World. \"It's not a marriage brokerage service. It's a new fun way of meeting new people.\" He pointed out that it was open to \"all fun-loving people between 18 and 45\", and added: \"People go into Tact for a number of reasons. Some of the people go into it just to meet new people, to get a lot of dates\u2026 some people want to get more serious, they are interested in forming a more lasting relationship, and then there are people who just want to get married.\"\nThe matchmaking questions were approved by psychologist Dr Salvatore V Didato, who felt there was \"a great social need\" for services such as Tact. He complained of other services, \"They say that they match people on many, many variables, but it winds up that they match them only on age, sex, religion, and height, or something like that.\" The Tact questionnaire went further by including a series of statements with which respondents had to either agree or disagree. The BBC report features responses from a typical customer: \"I worry over my relationships with people \u2013 yes. I enjoy people who express affection freely \u2013 yes. Most of the time I act as an independent \u2013 no. I enjoy going to parties \u2013 yes.\"\nWhile Tact was at the crest of a new technological wave, it was not quite the first computer-aided dating service. The two inventors had been inspired by Operation Match, which had been started earlier that year by Harvard students \u2013 decades before some students at the same university would create another computer-powered way for people to connect: Facebook.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nIn 1965, computers were still novel. Operation Match had to rent one of the university's computers for $100 an hour. It quickly proved popular, with thousands of students sending in questionnaires. \"You thought the computer was god, and the computer knew all,\" co-creator Jeff Tarr told the BBC's\u00a0Witness History\u00a0in 2014. Coincidentally, Tarr's daughter would go on to marry one of the creators of Match.com, one of the first internet dating sites. The computer provided reassurance: instead of relying on luck when finding your partner, you could be algorithmically matched to your soulmate.\nThe 1960s were a time of revolution. In the United States, the civil rights and second wave feminism movements were in full flow. Social norms were changing, and technology was developing quickly, too: the arrival of the computer coincided with society's increased permissiveness. By 1969, computer dating \u2013 or at least the idea of it \u2013 was mainstream enough to feature as a storyline in Bewitched, the supernatural sitcom. Samantha's cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery plays both characters) signs up to a computer dating service to find a mortal to marry, only to be matched with a warlock. Even Bob Ross himself found love through Tact \u2013 although it wasn't thanks to the computer. According to a New Yorker article published in the New Yorker in 2011, he eventually married a journalist who interviewed him about the project.\nTact's thousands of willing customers signalled a shift away from the more formal courtship culture of the first half of the century, and towards more modern attitudes. However, these early computer matchmaking services did not last long. While some people found their perfect partners, the services had a few fatal limitations. Because the services were primarily aimed at middle-class college students and graduates, there was a finite pool of potential matches. Also, the system was inefficient \u2013 it could be weeks between sending off your questionnaire and receiving your matches, who you then had to contact by phone or post. The parties organised by Tact were an attempt to get matches to mingle despite the distances that might be involved. Even then, it could still be awkward. The BBC's report pointed out that even \"a public relations man present couldn't get this party going until after dark,\" despite a prize of \"a big night out on the town\" for the most compatible couple present. Possibly the paper sign hung between two bins did not inspire confidence in the service.\nThe questions left something to be desired, too. As well as all the basic demographic and attraction-related queries, the form's \"dislikes\" section had options such as \"homosexuals\" and \"interracial couples\". The questionnaire also played to stereotypes: according to the New Yorker, men were asked to rank women's hairstyles, whereas women could specify where they could find their ideal man: chopping wood, painting in a studio, or in a garage.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The risqu\u00e9 romcom that defined a genre\n\u2022\u00a0The man behind the puzzle that 99% can't solve\n\u2022\u00a0Gloria Steinem on the trailblazing Ms Magazine\nWhile the creators were proud of the detail in their \"three levels\" of compatibility testing, their Cupid's arrows weren't always on target. \"We matched an older brother with his younger sister,\" admitted Ross. \"That didn't work out too well.\" He also said they'd had \"a number of people who weren't too satisfied after they've gone out\". On Tomorrow's World, one potential client quizzed Dr Didato on the robustness of the matching computer, after a bad experience with another service. \"She specified an age limit and gets some guy 20 years older!\"\nStill, while Tact, Operation Match and other similar services now seem comparatively quaint, people keep using technology to guide them towards romance \u2013 from the first personal ads in newspapers to video dating services, from online dating sites to AI-aided apps. According to Pew Research, one in 10 people who had partners in the US in 2023 met them via online dating. When it comes to matters of the heart, it seems, we can't help falling in love with the latest innovations.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Fingernails help protect the underlying skin from injury, and they also come in handy when you want to scratch an itch or peel a satsuma. But what do they reveal about your health?\n*\u00a0All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional. The BBC is not responsible or liable for any diagnosis made by a user based on the content of this site. The BBC is not liable for the contents of any external internet sites listed, nor does it endorse any commercial product or service mentioned or advised on any of the sites. Always consult your own GP if you're in any way concerned about your health.\u00a0\nThere's no shortage of folk wisdom about how to glean the state of your overall health from your nails, such as the pervasive idea that the white flecks that sometimes turn up \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are a sign of calcium deficiency. But is there any truth to these ideas?\nFirst up some basic anatomy. Nails are an extension of the skin. They are made from keratin, a super tough protein that shields the toes and tops of your fingers from trauma. The half-moon shape seen at the base of the nail is the lunula, which serves as the \"growth centre\" for the nail, producing the cells that will eventually harden into the nail plate . It sits above the cuticle, a layer of dead cells joining the base of the nailbed to the skin. The cuticle offers extra protection by acting as the nail's security guard, stopping bacteria, fungi and other pathogens in their tracks.\nWhile the eyes might be the windows to the soul, to a doctor the nails can be the windows to your health. Physicians can use them to diagnose all sorts of conditions, from dermatological problems to kidney disease or even autoimmune disorders.\n\"One of the first things I learned in medical school was to look for something called clubbing, where there is this loss of the angle between the nail and the nail bed itself,\" says Dan Baumgardt, a general practitioner in medicine and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol.\u00a0\nWith clubbing, the nail beds soften, and the nails almost seem to \"float\" instead of being firmly attached to the finger. The fingertips also appear large or bulging. \"It causes an unusual sort of swollen finger appearance where the finger looks a little bit like a drumstick,\" says Baumgardt.\nClubbing is a sign of extremely low blood oxygen levels. It is most commonly associated with lung cancer, but it can also indicate an infection of the lining of the heart chambers and heart valves, among other things. Other conditions where it is observed include celiac disease, cirrhosis of the liver and lung infections amongst others.\n\"If you do see a patient with clubbing the rule of thumb is to get them an x-ray as an urgency, because it could be an underlying lung cancer that could be explaining it,\" says Baumgardt. \"Having said that even though it's one of the first things that we learned in medical school. I really don't know why, because in all the 14 years I've been a doctor, I've only ever seen it once,\" he says.\nWhite flecks on the nail \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are often touted to be a sign of vitamin or mineral deficiencies. However, the evidence to support this is mixed. In one small study of undergraduates, there was no correlation between this symptom and a person's intake of either zinc or calcium. However, in one case report of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe leukonychia on his fingernails while deficient in selenium, it disappeared after treatment with this mineral.\nIn general, leukonychia are more likely to be a result of nail trauma. Stubbing your toe, trapping your fingernail in a door, too many manicures, or dropping a heavy object on your foot may cause such a mark.\nNevertheless, white discolouration on the nail could suggest an underlying health issue. For instance, white marks can be a sign of heavy metal poisoning with lead or arsenic. White discolouration of the nail could be a sign of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition that causes raised, inflamed, scaly patches of skin. If the entire nail turns white, this could suggest a deficiency of protein in the bloodstream, which can indicate kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If people have low protein levels in their bloodstream it [often] causes the whole nail to go white,\" says Baumgardt. \"We tend to associate that with people who've got liver disease, so things like cirrhosis of the liver, perhaps as a result of alcoholism.\"\u00a0\nBlue nails, on the other hand, are a sign that the body might be lacking oxygen. It could be a sign of serious heart disease or emphysema and is something you should get checked out by a doctor as soon as possible. This is also the case if you see dark lines underneath the nail, as although this can be caused by trauma, it could also be a sign of subungual melanoma, a rare but serious type of skin cancer.\nBleeding beneath the nail \u2013 if it doesn't heal \u2013 could also indicate something more serious. \"You can get what we call splinter haemorrhages, which look like little red streaks of blood, similar to if you imagine a splinter stuck under your nail,\" says Baumgardt. \"That haemorrhage can sometimes be suggestive of vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. One of the main underlying causes can be an infection of the heart valve, which causes these odd little red swellings,\" he says.\nOther, more common conditions can also be diagnosed by looking at the nails. When examining a patient, doctors typically look for alterations in colour, thickness and shape.\nFor example, in a healthy nail the underlying nail bed should be pink except for the white tips. Other colours could indicate an infection of the nail itself, or an underlying health condition.\n\"If you see either white or yellow discolouration on your toes, especially on your toenails, that is a sign of a fungal infection,\" says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull.\nAlthough in many countries, such as the US and the UK, you can buy over-the-counter topical medication for mild fungal nail infections, if you leave it too late then it can become more difficult to treat. (It's important to always consult a doctor if you suspect that you have a nail infection.)\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of the time when people have discolouration in the nails they don't realise that it's an infection, so it can get to a point where it becomes quite bad, and then they have to go and see a podiatrist,\" says Wilkinson.\nMeanwhile the shape of the nail can also reveal underlying problems. Healthy toe and fingernails should be convex, which means they curve slightly outwards. They shouldn't contain any dips or craters. If they do, it may be a sign that you have koilonychia, a condition where the nail curves inwards and looks thin and brittle. In some cases, people with koilonychia have a central depression in their nail deep enough to hold a drop of fluid, hence the condition is often referred to as \"spoon nails\".\u00a0\nIf your any of your nails bear a resemblance to a spoon, this could be a sign of anaemia, when the body doesn't have enough healthy blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency. However, it can also be a sign of coeliac disease, among other conditions.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, some changes in the nail can indicate nutritional deficiencies. Some people have horizontal ridges, known as Beau's lines, that run horizontally across their nails. This could indicate a deficiency such as insufficient protein. However, this feature could also be a sign of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease \u2013 a disorder involving reduced circulation of blood to certain parts of the body, usually due to the buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries \u2013 so it is still important to get it checked out.\n\"Beau's lines can indicate zinc deficiency, while brittle nails are a sign of hypothyroidism or vitamin B7 deficiency,\" says Mary Pearson, a paediatrician working at the University Hospital of Wales. \"In some cases we might be more diligent about looking for these, for example in safeguarding cases where we are concerned about a child's nutrition, or where we suspect chronic disease,\" she says.\nIn other cases, nail changes may be caused by lifestyle factors rather than health problems. For example peeling nails, also known as\u00a0onychoschizia, occurs when thin layers of the nails literally separate from the free nail edge and peel back. \"Onychoschizia may be the result of excessive hand washing, nail dryness, and the use of acrylics and other nail polishes,\" says Joshua Zeichner, professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital\u00a0in New York.\u00a0\nYou may wonder what it is about nails that makes them so revealing of a person's underlying health. One of the main reasons is that nails are obviously one of the few parts of the body that you can see from the outside.\n\"Nails are extensions of the skin, effectively, and your skin can tell you so much about what's going on in your body,\" says Baumgardt. \"Your first impression of a patient often starts from the bedside, so you look them all over and you start off with their nails, you look in their eyes and their mouth. And you start to do an end-of-the-bed assessment, trying to pick out diagnostic pictures from that point early on. So nails are one of the first things we see,\" he says.\nWhile most of the time changes in the nail are harmless, and are simply down to a nail injury, if you notice that the change in shape, colour, or texture is more permanent, then you should always consult the advice of a doctor.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Ever since absinthe was outlawed due to rumours it led to insanity, this simple drink has become the nation's go-to apertif.\nIt's difficult to imagine France without ap\u00e9ro (aperitif hour), that magic moment when time stops, and suddenly, everyone has a drink in hand.\u00a0\nIn a country so proud of its regional products, it's not surprising that the contents of one's aperitif glass varies, from cassis-scented kir in Burgundy to beer on the Belgian border to cloudy aniseed-infused pastis in Marseille. But despite its strong association with southern France, conjuring images of lazy summer afternoons playing p\u00e9tanque by the sea, one ap\u00e9ro spirit is omnipresent in France: pastis. Not only do sales of pastis represent one-fifth of all spirits sold nationwide, but it's the default aperitif drink as far north as Picardie.\n\"It's not like some of those other regional aperitifs,\" said Forest Collins, author of the book Drink Like a Local: Paris. \"Pineau de Charentes, you're mainly going to find around Cognac. Pommeau, you're mainly going to find in Normandy. But it's pretty likely that anywhere in France, you might find a bottle of pastis.\"\nYet, pastis didn't become France's go-to aperitif by design. If not for the nation's 1915 ban of absinthe due to its alleged harmful effects and the marketing chops of Marseillais Paul Ricard, the herbal liqueur may never have become France's most famous.\nAbsinthe's quiet conquest of France occurred in the wake of the 19th Century phylloxera epidemic that wiped out nearly half of the country's vineyards. Soon, it supplanted not just wine but beer in the north, cider in Normandy and flavoured wines like quinquina, explained Marie-Claude Delahaye, author of the book L'Absinthe: Histoire de la F\u00e9e Verteand founder of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Absinthe in Auvers-sur-Oise. According to Delahaye, absinthe introduced aniseed to the aperitif hour, along with a \"playful and convivial ritual\" of diluting the 75% ABV liquor with sugar and water.\n\"It was the sprout of what could be an extraordinary success,\" Delahaye said. Yet, absinthe's rise to fame was stymied in 1915, when it was banned throughout the country following rumours that it led to insanity. Aficionados immediately began clamouring for something to fill the aniseed-scented gap. \"If absinthe had continued to be commercialised,\" explained Delahaye, \"pastis never would have appeared.\"\nWhile pastis and absinthe share an aniseed flavour profile, the similarities stop there. Distilled absinthe boasts more complexity than sweetened, macerated pastis, and at 40 to 45% ABV, pastis' alcoholic power pales in comparison. This put pastis at an advantage, according to Collins: absinthe, she said, was seen as \"the drink of degenerate artists\" (including Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse Lautrec and Vincent Van Gogh, who even included the spirit in some of his paintings). With pastis, meanwhile, drinkers still got \"that nice little buzz, and that nice aniseed flavour\" without the negative connotations.\n\"I think that's the effect that pastis had on aperitif culture,\" Collins said. \"It allowed this drinking culture of aniseed to carry on.\"\nOrder a pastis in most cafes, and it'll be poured from a bottle emblazoned with a bright yellow sun and one name: Ricard. But before there was Ricard, there was Pernod \u2013 two Pernods, to be precise. Both Henri-Louis Pernod and the unrelated Jules-F\u00e9lix Pernod launched anisettes in 1918, merging their companies in 1928. Ricard, meanwhile, only began selling his version in 1932. If Ricard's became the most famous, it's in large part thanks to his marketing chops. He appealed immediately to the French love of terroir, deriving the name of his anisette from the Proven\u00e7al pastisson(mixture), and attributing his recipe to \"a poacher \u2026 who knew all of the herbs of the mountains and the garriguesurrounding us\". He soon set about disseminating the story \u2013 and the local liqueur \u2013 by going door to door to bistros and cafes across France.\nHow to ap\u00e9ro\nAp\u00e9ro hour usually takes place between 18:00 and 19:30, when France's squares and terraces fill with groups sipping golden demis of beer, pink kirs and pastis. Cafes typically serve a free bowl of crisps, pretzels or olives with your chosen ap\u00e9ro, though the food is secondary to the drinks and conversation. Ap\u00e9ro isn't about inebriation, and it's not uncommon for friends to nurse a drink for an hour before parting ways to have dinner at home.\n\"He used to say, 'Make a friend a day,'\" said Gabrielle Arevikian-Xerri, brand director of Pernod-Ricard.\nPerhaps Ricard's most successful initiative was merch. An amateur artist, Ricard created branded posters evoking sunny Marseille, not to mention glasses and ashtrays, bucket hats and caps. He released thousands of such objects during the 1948 Tour de France; today, they're omnipresent at French flea markets, where keen collectors track them down.\nJacky Roussial is one such collector. Over 39 years, Roussial has amassed no fewer than 3,500 Ricard-branded objects, including 180 different goblets, playing cards and umbrellas. His most prized pastis possession is a pichet tambourin, a 1950s-era pitcher depicting a tambourine player he dubs \"the grail of any collector\". It goes for about \u20ac4,000.\nThese pitchers aren't just trinkets; they're an essential part of serving pastis, a drink that's customisable by design. Each 2cl pour is meant to be diluted with water to taste. Many also sweeten their pastis with syrup: a blend of bright green mint and pastis is called a perroquet (parrot), while the addition of grenadine makes a tomate (tomato).

        "article_text": "Ever since absinthe was outlawed due to rumours it led to insanity, this simple drink has become the nation's go-to apertif.\nIt's difficult to imagine France without ap\u00e9ro (aperitif hour), that magic moment when time stops, and suddenly, everyone has a drink in hand.\u00a0\nIn a country so proud of its regional products, it's not surprising that the contents of one's aperitif glass varies, from cassis-scented kir in Burgundy to beer on the Belgian border to cloudy aniseed-infused pastis in Marseille. But despite its strong association with southern France, conjuring images of lazy summer afternoons playing p\u00e9tanque by the sea, one ap\u00e9ro spirit is omnipresent in France: pastis. Not only do sales of pastis represent one-fifth of all spirits sold nationwide, but it's the default aperitif drink as far north as Picardie.\n\"It's not like some of those other regional aperitifs,\" said Forest Collins, author of the book Drink Like a Local: Paris. \"Pineau de Charentes, you're mainly going to find around Cognac. Pommeau, you're mainly going to find in Normandy. But it's pretty likely that anywhere in France, you might find a bottle of pastis.\"\nYet, pastis didn't become France's go-to aperitif by design. If not for the nation's 1915 ban of absinthe due to its alleged harmful effects and the marketing chops of Marseillais Paul Ricard, the herbal liqueur may never have become France's most famous.\nAbsinthe's quiet conquest of France occurred in the wake of the 19th Century phylloxera epidemic that wiped out nearly half of the country's vineyards. Soon, it supplanted not just wine but beer in the north, cider in Normandy and flavoured wines like quinquina, explained Marie-Claude Delahaye, author of the book L'Absinthe: Histoire de la F\u00e9e Verteand founder of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Absinthe in Auvers-sur-Oise. According to Delahaye, absinthe introduced aniseed to the aperitif hour, along with a \"playful and convivial ritual\" of diluting the 75% ABV liquor with sugar and water.\n\"It was the sprout of what could be an extraordinary success,\" Delahaye said. Yet, absinthe's rise to fame was stymied in 1915, when it was banned throughout the country following rumours that it led to insanity. Aficionados immediately began clamouring for something to fill the aniseed-scented gap. \"If absinthe had continued to be commercialised,\" explained Delahaye, \"pastis never would have appeared.\"\nWhile pastis and absinthe share an aniseed flavour profile, the similarities stop there. Distilled absinthe boasts more complexity than sweetened, macerated pastis, and at 40 to 45% ABV, pastis' alcoholic power pales in comparison. This put pastis at an advantage, according to Collins: absinthe, she said, was seen as \"the drink of degenerate artists\" (including Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse Lautrec and Vincent Van Gogh, who even included the spirit in some of his paintings). With pastis, meanwhile, drinkers still got \"that nice little buzz, and that nice aniseed flavour\" without the negative connotations.\n\"I think that's the effect that pastis had on aperitif culture,\" Collins said. \"It allowed this drinking culture of aniseed to carry on.\"\nOrder a pastis in most cafes, and it'll be poured from a bottle emblazoned with a bright yellow sun and one name: Ricard. But before there was Ricard, there was Pernod \u2013 two Pernods, to be precise. Both Henri-Louis Pernod and the unrelated Jules-F\u00e9lix Pernod launched anisettes in 1918, merging their companies in 1928. Ricard, meanwhile, only began selling his version in 1932. If Ricard's became the most famous, it's in large part thanks to his marketing chops. He appealed immediately to the French love of terroir, deriving the name of his anisette from the Proven\u00e7al pastisson(mixture), and attributing his recipe to \"a poacher \u2026 who knew all of the herbs of the mountains and the garriguesurrounding us\". He soon set about disseminating the story \u2013 and the local liqueur \u2013 by going door to door to bistros and cafes across France.\nHow to ap\u00e9ro\nAp\u00e9ro hour usually takes place between 18:00 and 19:30, when France's squares and terraces fill with groups sipping golden demis of beer, pink kirs and pastis. Cafes typically serve a free bowl of crisps, pretzels or olives with your chosen ap\u00e9ro, though the food is secondary to the drinks and conversation. Ap\u00e9ro isn't about inebriation, and it's not uncommon for friends to nurse a drink for an hour before parting ways to have dinner at home.\n\"He used to say, 'Make a friend a day,'\" said Gabrielle Arevikian-Xerri, brand director of Pernod-Ricard.\nPerhaps Ricard's most successful initiative was merch. An amateur artist, Ricard created branded posters evoking sunny Marseille, not to mention glasses and ashtrays, bucket hats and caps. He released thousands of such objects during the 1948 Tour de France; today, they're omnipresent at French flea markets, where keen collectors track them down.\nJacky Roussial is one such collector. Over 39 years, Roussial has amassed no fewer than 3,500 Ricard-branded objects, including 180 different goblets, playing cards and umbrellas. His most prized pastis possession is a pichet tambourin, a 1950s-era pitcher depicting a tambourine player he dubs \"the grail of any collector\". It goes for about \u20ac4,000.\nThese pitchers aren't just trinkets; they're an essential part of serving pastis, a drink that's customisable by design. Each 2cl pour is meant to be diluted with water to taste. Many also sweeten their pastis with syrup: a blend of bright green mint and pastis is called a perroquet (parrot), while the addition of grenadine makes a tomate (tomato). Of them, Arevikian-Xerri said, the mauresque (a blend of pastis and local southern orgeat) is the most popular.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A Michelin-starred chef's guide to Marseille\n\u2022 The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nIn recent years, modern mixologists have been toying with crafting more complex pastis cocktails.

        "article_text": "There's a new race in space, but it's not where you might think. It's happening close to home \u2013 in the nearest bit of space, right on the edge of Earth's atmosphere.\nHigh in the skies of Earth, a new space race is underway. Here, just above the boundary where space begins, companies are trying to create a new class of daring satellites. Not quite high-altitude planes and not quite low-orbiting satellites, these sky skimmers are designed to race around our planet in an untapped region, with potentially huge benefits on offer.\nRoughly 10,000 satellites are orbiting our planet right now, at speeds of up to 17,000mph (27,000km/h). Every one of these delicate contraptions is in constant free-fall and would drop straight back down to Earth were it not for the blistering speeds at which they travel. It's their considerable sideways momentum, perfectly stabilised against the Earth's gravitational pull downwards, that keeps satellites in orbit.\nA new class of satellites is aiming to push the limits of this balancing act and plough a much more precarious, lower orbit that would skim the top of Earth's atmosphere. Known as Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO), spacecraft at these altitudes have to battle against the significantly greater drag from the air in the upper reaches of the atmosphere than their loftier cousins, lest they get pushed out of the sky. Should they manage it, however, such satellites might achieve something even more jaw-dropping \u2013 they could potentially fly forever.\n\"When you start describing it to people, it starts to sound like a perpetual motion machine,\" says Spence Wise, senior vice-president at Redwire, an aerospace firm in Florida. A perpetual motion machine is not meant to be possible. But it almost is, in this instance.\nA handful of pioneering companies have begun work on designs for satellites that may be able to orbit the planet at these unusually low altitudes while simultaneously harvesting air and using it to make propellant \u2013 literally on the fly. This new generation of orbiters could enable ultra-high-definition surveillance of activities on the ground, or superfast satellite-based communications.\nIf you want to send something into orbit, you have to decide how high your satellite is going to fly. Earth orbits are generally described in terms of altitude and are categorised into different sections. In high orbits, 22,000 miles (36,000km) above Earth, satellites enter a geostationary position, meaning they are always above the same location on Earth below. This is useful for telecommunications and weather monitoring, for example. Next is Medium Earth orbit, which spans from roughly 22,000 miles (36,000km) down to 1,200 miles (2,000km) above the planet's surface. Below this is Low Earth orbit, which stretches down to altitudes of 250 miles (400km), where the International Space Station (ISS) is found.\nEven further below this lies VLEO, loosely defined as anything below the ISS and down to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km). Operating here is difficult because of the influence of Earth's atmosphere. \"The atmosphere will increase exponentially as you come down,\" says Hugh Lewis, a professor of astronautics and a space debris expert at the University of Southampton in the UK.\nThat creates more drag on your satellite, which can spell doom. As molecules in the atmosphere smash into the satellite, they rob the vehicle of its momentum, causing the tug of our planet's gravity to drag it towards the ground.\nA satellite left in medium Earth orbit or above would carry on circling our planet for millennia. In VLEO, however, it would last barely months, weeks, or even days depending on its speed, shape and mass, dictating the amount of drag it produces and thus its lifetime. Once a satellite dips to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km), the end is imminent. The intense friction created by the thicker atmosphere subjects the satellite to temperatures of thousands of degrees, ultimately tearing it apart.\nAll satellites pass through VLEO on their way up or down, but not many have purposefully tried to stay there. One such spacecraft, however, was the European Space Agency's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. Launched in 2009, it orbited at an altitude of around 155 miles (250km), using an ion propulsion system to fire out charged particles behind the spacecraft. This gave it a constant level of thrust that could counteract the drag of the atmosphere.\nGOCE was intended to measure Earth's gravitational field with extreme precision, which it achieved. But it also demonstrated the design choices that were necessary for operating in VLEO. It had a sleek, elongated form that helped it to overcome atmospheric drag. \"It looked like a dart,\" says Lewis. GOCE ultimately ran out of fuel and burned up in the atmosphere on re-entry in 2013.\nSeveral companies are now trying to do something even more impressive. They are developing technology to harvest molecules from the thin layer of air that is present in VLEO in order to actually propel satellites here. Such a system, called Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP), has been made possible by advancements in electric and ion propulsion in recent years. In essence, it involves fixing a large bucket or opening to the front of the satellite, into which gas molecules from the atmosphere flow before they are ionised to create plasma that generates thrust.\n\"The idea is to use the same air slowing down your satellite as a propellant,\" says Francesco Romano, a scientist at the Swiss Plasma Center in Lausanne, Switzerland, who has previously studied this technology. Using electric and magnetic fields, the engine would ionise gas from the atmosphere, taking away one electron from each molecule, to produce a free electron and an ion. Then, using magnets, the electrons and ions are pushed out the back of the spacecraft, producing thrust. \"Theoretically, if you can generate a thrust that is the same as your drag, you stay at this altitude for an infinite amount of time,\" says Romano.\nTo date, an assortment of experimental ABEP systems have been able to produce relatively small amounts of thrust at ground level, but their feasibility in orbit has yet to be properly tested.\nOne company investigating the potential of ABEP is Stellar Advanced Concepts in London. Together with another\u00a0firm in the Netherlands and the University of Manchester, the company\u00a0received a grant of \u00a3390,000 ($510,000) from the British government towards their efforts in July 2024. They hope to launch a demonstration of the technology into space by 2027. \"That would be a small satellite with a small payload, maybe an Earth observation camera of some kind, as a proof of principle,\" says Newsam.\nA start-up called Kreios Space, based in Vigo, Spain, is also working on an ABEP prototype it aims to fly by 2026. In Kreios's case, this would be a small satellite \"that allows us to do all the testing in orbit in different altitudes,\" says Adri\u00e1n Senar Tejedor, the company's CEO and co-founder. The optimal altitude for thrust and drag balancing is expected to be between 125 to 155 miles (200 to 250km). \"That's the sweet spot,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nBut he points out that significant contracts for developing this technology are emerging on the other side of the Atlantic.\nThe US Department of Defense's Otter program has already committed more than $20m (\u00a316m) to help several companies develop air-breathing VLEO satellites. One of them, Redwire is designing a sleek \"orbital drone\" called SabreSat.\nRedwire's design for a satellite has solar panels facing edge-on to its motion, like the fins of a fish, in order to reduce drag on the spacecraft. The company says SabreSat would be able to spend up to seven years in VLEO. The build would be modular, so that different versions of the satellite could fly with different instruments on board. \"You can think of it like a ship,\" says Wise. \"It has bulkheads, and we're able to add additional bulkheads to increase the length.\"\nThe European arm of Redwire is concurrently developing its own VLEO satellite, called Phantom, as part of a European Space Agency (Esa) project called Skimsat. \"We're currently in the middle of the design stage, and the team is working towards a launch in 2027 or 2028,\" says Juan Pablo Ramos, business development manager for Redwire in Antwerp, Belgium.\nPhantom will not use air-breathing technology, however. Instead, it will rely on a specific blend of undisclosed materials on the satellite to reduce drag and an aerodynamic cone-shaped front. \"The cone is designed to improve drag and protect the instruments,\" says Ramos.\nGetting to orbit soon is important. \"I expect it to become increasingly popular,\" says Newsam. \"I do think it's important to have first-mover advantage. Whoever gains the credibility of being able to produce an ABEP system, they would win the orders. But there should end up being a reasonably big market.\"\nThere are some very good reasons for operating a satellite in VLEO. The first is Earth imaging \u2013 the closer you are to Earth, the higher resolution your images can be. \"You could either have smaller cameras and gain the same quality of data, or the same camera and get a higher resolution,\" adds Newsam.\nThat might be useful for the military, but also for civilian purposes too. \"There are lots of applications in maritime, agriculture, wildfire monitoring,\" says Senar Tejedor. And there could be scientific benefits from studying the atmosphere in VLEO. Putting sensors on satellites operating here \"would be a dream\", says Sean Elvidge, an assistant professor of space environment at the University of Birmingham in the UK. \"It would tell us an awful lot about the environment.\"\nThe other major application of being in VLEO is that you are closer to the ground for communications. That is particularly useful for space internet services, like SpaceX's Starlink network, which currently beams the internet to receivers on the ground from higher orbits. By using lower satellites in VLEO, the antennas can act like mobile phone towers and beam the internet straight to your phone. \"Going direct to a cell phone is a challenging task to do from space,\" says Tim Farrar, a satellite communications expert in California. \"These lower [orbits] could enable a direct-to-cell constellation.\"\nThe overall global market for VLEO satellite services could be vast. \"We expect it to be around $15bn (\u00a311.5bn) in 2032,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nAn oft-touted benefit of VLEO, aside from the various novel applications, is that this kind of orbit is self-cleaning. Generally, defunct or dead satellites in VLEO will eventually fall back into the deeper atmosphere and break up, limiting the volume of space junk that would otherwise be left orbiting Earth.\nWhile this is true, Lewis points out that debris generated in VLEO can sometimes get flung into higher orbits, posing problems for other satellites. An Indian anti-satellite missile test in VLEO in 2019, for example, sent debris up to an altitude of 870 miles (1,400km) and it remained in orbit for 18 months, says Lewis. \"If you have a collision or energetic explosion, some of those fragments can be ejected into larger orbits,\" he says. \"It's not this perfect environment.\"\nHaving lots of new satellites potentially operating in VLEO is also going to make for a complicated environment, says Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at the Secure World Foundation in Washington DC in the US. Operating in VLEO is \"not a cut and dry thing\", says Samson.\nAt such altitudes, satellites are particularly sensitive to the effects of the Sun, since heat can shrink or swell Earth's atmosphere as solar activity waxes and wanes. This caused trouble for 38 newly launched SpaceX Starlink satellites in 2022 when a geomagnetic storm caused the amount of atmospheric drag to increase by up to 50%, causing them to be pulled back towards Earth and burn up. It is a risk that will need to be carefully monitored by keeping a close eye on space weather forecasts, says Samson.\nYet there's little doubt about the rising interest in this poorly exploited region at the very edge of space. \"There is a race,\" says Senar Tejedor. And whoever can crack VLEO first will usher in a new era of space technology.\n* This article has been updated to clarify that Redwire will not achieve limitless VLEO with its SabreSat satellite under its contract with Darpa. It will be able to support a mission lifetime of up to seven years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

It's happening close to home \u2013 in the nearest bit of space, right on the edge of Earth's atmosphere.\nHigh in the skies of Earth, a new space race is underway. Here, just above the boundary where space begins, companies are trying to create a new class of daring satellites. Not quite high-altitude planes and not quite low-orbiting satellites, these sky skimmers are designed to race around our planet in an untapped region, with potentially huge benefits on offer.\nRoughly 10,000 satellites are orbiting our planet right now, at speeds of up to 17,000mph (27,000km/h). Every one of these delicate contraptions is in constant free-fall and would drop straight back down to Earth were it not for the blistering speeds at which they travel. It's their considerable sideways momentum, perfectly stabilised against the Earth's gravitational pull downwards, that keeps satellites in orbit.\nA new class of satellites is aiming to push the limits of this balancing act and plough a much more precarious, lower orbit that would skim the top of Earth's atmosphere. Known as Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO), spacecraft at these altitudes have to battle against the significantly greater drag from the air in the upper reaches of the atmosphere than their loftier cousins, lest they get pushed out of the sky. Should they manage it, however, such satellites might achieve something even more jaw-dropping \u2013 they could potentially fly forever.\n\"When you start describing it to people, it starts to sound like a perpetual motion machine,\" says Spence Wise, senior vice-president at Redwire, an aerospace firm in Florida. A perpetual motion machine is not meant to be possible. But it almost is, in this instance.\nA handful of pioneering companies have begun work on designs for satellites that may be able to orbit the planet at these unusually low altitudes while simultaneously harvesting air and using it to make propellant \u2013 literally on the fly. This new generation of orbiters could enable ultra-high-definition surveillance of activities on the ground, or superfast satellite-based communications.\nIf you want to send something into orbit, you have to decide how high your satellite is going to fly. Earth orbits are generally described in terms of altitude and are categorised into different sections. In high orbits, 22,000 miles (36,000km) above Earth, satellites enter a geostationary position, meaning they are always above the same location on Earth below. This is useful for telecommunications and weather monitoring, for example. Next is Medium Earth orbit, which spans from roughly 22,000 miles (36,000km) down to 1,200 miles (2,000km) above the planet's surface. Below this is Low Earth orbit, which stretches down to altitudes of 250 miles (400km), where the International Space Station (ISS) is found.\nEven further below this lies VLEO, loosely defined as anything below the ISS and down to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km). Operating here is difficult because of the influence of Earth's atmosphere. \"The atmosphere will increase exponentially as you come down,\" says Hugh Lewis, a professor of astronautics and a space debris expert at the University of Southampton in the UK.\nThat creates more drag on your satellite, which can spell doom. As molecules in the atmosphere smash into the satellite, they rob the vehicle of its momentum, causing the tug of our planet's gravity to drag it towards the ground.\nA satellite left in medium Earth orbit or above would carry on circling our planet for millennia. In VLEO, however, it would last barely months, weeks, or even days depending on its speed, shape and mass, dictating the amount of drag it produces and thus its lifetime. Once a satellite dips to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km), the end is imminent. The intense friction created by the thicker atmosphere subjects the satellite to temperatures of thousands of degrees, ultimately tearing it apart.\nAll satellites pass through VLEO on their way up or down, but not many have purposefully tried to stay there. One such spacecraft, however, was the European Space Agency's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. Launched in 2009, it orbited at an altitude of around 155 miles (250km), using an ion propulsion system to fire out charged particles behind the spacecraft. This gave it a constant level of thrust that could counteract the drag of the atmosphere.\nGOCE was intended to measure Earth's gravitational field with extreme precision, which it achieved. But it also demonstrated the design choices that were necessary for operating in VLEO. It had a sleek, elongated form that helped it to overcome atmospheric drag. \"It looked like a dart,\" says Lewis. GOCE ultimately ran out of fuel and burned up in the atmosphere on re-entry in 2013.\nSeveral companies are now trying to do something even more impressive. They are developing technology to harvest molecules from the thin layer of air that is present in VLEO in order to actually propel satellites here. Such a system, called Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP), has been made possible by advancements in electric and ion propulsion in recent years. In essence, it involves fixing a large bucket or opening to the front of the satellite, into which gas molecules from the atmosphere flow before they are ionised to create plasma that generates thrust.\n\"The idea is to use the same air slowing down your satellite as a propellant,\" says Francesco Romano, a scientist at the Swiss Plasma Center in Lausanne, Switzerland, who has previously studied this technology. Using electric and magnetic fields, the engine would ionise gas from the atmosphere, taking away one electron from each molecule, to produce a free electron and an ion. Then, using magnets, the electrons and ions are pushed out the back of the spacecraft, producing thrust. \"Theoretically, if you can generate a thrust that is the same as your drag, you stay at this altitude for an infinite amount of time,\" says Romano.\nTo date, an assortment of experimental ABEP systems have been able to produce relatively small amounts of thrust at ground level, but their feasibility in orbit has yet to be properly tested.\nOne company investigating the potential of ABEP is Stellar Advanced Concepts in London. Together with another\u00a0firm in the Netherlands and the University of Manchester, the company\u00a0received a grant of \u00a3390,000 ($510,000) from the British government towards their efforts in July 2024. They hope to launch a demonstration of the technology into space by 2027. \"That would be a small satellite with a small payload, maybe an Earth observation camera of some kind, as a proof of principle,\" says Newsam.\nA start-up called Kreios Space, based in Vigo, Spain, is also working on an ABEP prototype it aims to fly by 2026. In Kreios's case, this would be a small satellite \"that allows us to do all the testing in orbit in different altitudes,\" says Adri\u00e1n Senar Tejedor, the company's CEO and co-founder. The optimal altitude for thrust and drag balancing is expected to be between 125 to 155 miles (200 to 250km). \"That's the sweet spot,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nBut he points out that significant contracts for developing this technology are emerging on the other side of the Atlantic.\nThe US Department of Defense's Otter program has already committed more than $20m (\u00a316m) to help several companies develop air-breathing VLEO satellites. One of them, Redwire is designing a sleek \"orbital drone\" called SabreSat.\nRedwire's design for a satellite has solar panels facing edge-on to its motion, like the fins of a fish, in order to reduce drag on the spacecraft. The company says SabreSat would be able to spend up to seven years in VLEO. The build would be modular, so that different versions of the satellite could fly with different instruments on board. \"You can think of it like a ship,\" says Wise. \"It has bulkheads, and we're able to add additional bulkheads to increase the length.\"\nThe European arm of Redwire is concurrently developing its own VLEO satellite, called Phantom, as part of a European Space Agency (Esa) project called Skimsat. \"We're currently in the middle of the design stage, and the team is working towards a launch in 2027 or 2028,\" says Juan Pablo Ramos, business development manager for Redwire in Antwerp, Belgium.\nPhantom will not use air-breathing technology, however. Instead, it will rely on a specific blend of undisclosed materials on the satellite to reduce drag and an aerodynamic cone-shaped front. \"The cone is designed to improve drag and protect the instruments,\" says Ramos.\nGetting to orbit soon is important. \"I expect it to become increasingly popular,\" says Newsam. \"I do think it's important to have first-mover advantage. Whoever gains the credibility of being able to produce an ABEP system, they would win the orders. But there should end up being a reasonably big market.\"\nThere are some very good reasons for operating a satellite in VLEO. The first is Earth imaging \u2013 the closer you are to Earth, the higher resolution your images can be. \"You could either have smaller cameras and gain the same quality of data, or the same camera and get a higher resolution,\" adds Newsam.\nThat might be useful for the military, but also for civilian purposes too. \"There are lots of applications in maritime, agriculture, wildfire monitoring,\" says Senar Tejedor. And there could be scientific benefits from studying the atmosphere in VLEO. Putting sensors on satellites operating here \"would be a dream\", says Sean Elvidge, an assistant professor of space environment at the University of Birmingham in the UK. \"It would tell us an awful lot about the environment.\"\nThe other major application of being in VLEO is that you are closer to the ground for communications. That is particularly useful for space internet services, like SpaceX's Starlink network, which currently beams the internet to receivers on the ground from higher orbits. By using lower satellites in VLEO, the antennas can act like mobile phone towers and beam the internet straight to your phone. \"Going direct to a cell phone is a challenging task to do from space,\" says Tim Farrar, a satellite communications expert in California. \"These lower [orbits] could enable a direct-to-cell constellation.\"\nThe overall global market for VLEO satellite services could be vast. \"We expect it to be around $15bn (\u00a311.5bn) in 2032,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nAn oft-touted benefit of VLEO, aside from the various novel applications, is that this kind of orbit is self-cleaning. Generally, defunct or dead satellites in VLEO will eventually fall back into the deeper atmosphere and break up, limiting the volume of space junk that would otherwise be left orbiting Earth.\nWhile this is true, Lewis points out that debris generated in VLEO can sometimes get flung into higher orbits, posing problems for other satellites. An Indian anti-satellite missile test in VLEO in 2019, for example, sent debris up to an altitude of 870 miles (1,400km) and it remained in orbit for 18 months, says Lewis. \"If you have a collision or energetic explosion, some of those fragments can be ejected into larger orbits,\" he says. \"It's not this perfect environment.\"\nHaving lots of new satellites potentially operating in VLEO is also going to make for a complicated environment, says Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at the Secure World Foundation in Washington DC in the US. Operating in VLEO is \"not a cut and dry thing\", says Samson.\nAt such altitudes, satellites are particularly sensitive to the effects of the Sun, since heat can shrink or swell Earth's atmosphere as solar activity waxes and wanes. This caused trouble for 38 newly launched SpaceX Starlink satellites in 2022 when a geomagnetic storm caused the amount of atmospheric drag to increase by up to 50%, causing them to be pulled back towards Earth and burn up. It is a risk that will need to be carefully monitored by keeping a close eye on space weather forecasts, says Samson.\nYet there's little doubt about the rising interest in this poorly exploited region at the very edge of space. \"There is a race,\" says Senar Tejedor. And whoever can crack VLEO first will usher in a new era of space technology.\n* This article has been updated to clarify that Redwire will not achieve limitless VLEO with its SabreSat satellite under its contract with Darpa. It will be able to support a mission lifetime of up to seven years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "He's an expert on all of NOLA's iconic foods but has a special place in his heart for gumbo. Here are his favourite bowls \u2013 from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine \u2013 unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\u00a0\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of\u00a0Acadian\u00a0descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\u00a0\nThe SpeciaList\nEmeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a\u00a0YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of\u00a0opinions on the\u00a0right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game \u2013 or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra \u2013 a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse \u2013 famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live \u00a0\u2013 has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo \u2013 served over rice \u2013 Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant, Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit\u00a0since\u00a0the space first opened in 1990. \"It used to be made with seafood,\" he says, \"then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.\"\nIt's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the\u00a0presentation\u00a0has too. \"The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,\" he says, \"that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux.\" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.\nHere are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.\nCommander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.\nPo'boys\nPo'boys (sometimes also written \"poor boy\") are one of NOLA's classic sandwiches \u2013 meats or seafood stuffed into crisp, light French bread. Lagasse's favourite? The po'boys at Domilise's. Inside the little yellow house on Annunciation Street, customers can choose from a whole menu of classic po'boys,\u00a0but Lagasse's top picks are fried shrimp, fried oysters or roast beef. \"You need about 20 napkins to eat the roast beef po-boy. It's soaked in gravy on NOLA-style French bread,\" he says. \"People debate whether to get it dressed\u00a0or not. I go for the dressed\u00a0po'boy, with\u00a0lettuce, tomato and pickles.\"\nIn the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct\u00a0blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of \"haute Creole cuisine\", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo.\u00a0\nEven though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. \"Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,\" he says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.commanderspalace.com/\nAddress: 1403 Washington Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: +1 504-899-8221\nInstagram: @commanderspalace\nCaf\u00e9 Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.\nLagasse's Insider Tips\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde\u00a0in the French Quarter is iconic but crawling with tourists; locals get their hot sugar-dusted beignets at Caf\u00e9\u00a0du Monde's other location on\u00a0Dreyfous Drive\u00a0instead.\u00a0\nAnd for Lagasse, NOLA's best fried chicken comes from\u00a0Popeye's Chicken, the international fast food chain, founded in New Orleans in 1972. \"I don't know why, it's the same formula.

        "article_text": "He's an expert on all of NOLA's iconic foods but has a special place in his heart for gumbo. Here are his favourite bowls \u2013 from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine \u2013 unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\u00a0\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of\u00a0Acadian\u00a0descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\u00a0\nThe SpeciaList\nEmeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a\u00a0YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of\u00a0opinions on the\u00a0right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game \u2013 or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra \u2013 a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse \u2013 famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live \u00a0\u2013 has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says.

        "article_text": "Some species of birds like geese save energy by flying in close formation. Airliners could use a similar trick to burn less fuel.\nIn the early 1500s, Italian Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci developed a fascination with avian flight. He spent his days meticulously studying the movement of birds, sketching observations of how they maintain their balance and perform soaring manoeuvres.\nHis ambition was to make a flying machine from his scientific investigations. But what he wound up creating instead was the seminal work\u00a0Codex on the Flight of Birds. It pioneered what would later become the field of \"biomimicry\", the study of the natural world in search of efficient design.\u00a0\nCenturies later, experimentation flourished. Pioneering aviators like Otto Lilienthal, Igo Etrich and the Wright brothers mimicked birds to design their aircraft and the aviation industry was born.\nIn 2019, Airbus returned to the study of birds with the \"fello'fly\" project to understand how migrating geese conserve energy while flying in V formation. From it, a\u00a0\"wake energy retrieval\" technique was developed to help\u00a0trailing jets\u00a0pinpoint the optimal location to fly in the wake vortex of a lead jet. This was found to generate fuel savings of 5% to 10% per\u00a0trip, similar to\u00a0findings published by the US space agency Nasa.\u00a0\nIn July 2023, the effort evolved into the\u00a0Geese project\u00a0with\u00a0\u20ac10m (\u00a38.4m/$10.5m)\u00a0in funding, and support from the European Union's air traffic management research arm, Sesar.\nEarlier this month, Delta Air Lines and Airbus announced that they were taking the \"fello'fly\" concept out of the lab and into the skies, targeting the second half of this year to deploy the technique into live operations. The goal will be to test a manoeuvre called \"rendez-vous\" in which two passenger jets are paired over the Atlantic Ocean. For example, this could be an Air France flight from New York City and a Delta Air Lines flight from Miami, both heading to London. In pairing, the two planes would be separated by the regulatory 1,000ft (303m) in altitude while attempting to\u00a0reduce the distance between them to\u00a01.2 nautical miles (2.2km), the same distance that fuel savings were most recently achieved in the lab.\nDelta chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca tells the BBC that this distance is substantially closer than planes fly today, which is typically at a separation of three to five nautical miles (5.5 to 9.2km), so the first step will be to see whether the gap can be narrowed without compromising safety.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0video\u00a0shows an animation of how \"fello'fly\" is expected to work.\nAs for why transatlantic flights were chosen for the test, DeLuca explains, \"there are very few sustainable solutions for wide bodies flying today, besides sustainable aviation fuel. So a 5% benefit off of a flight that's going across the Atlantic with a big airplane that's burning a lot of fuel has the biggest bang for the buck\".\nStephen Trent, an analyst at Citi, says on some routes the formation flying technique could be useuful. \"My guess is that it is also somewhat route dependent, and somewhat dependent on what kind of equipment you're operating. So the opportunity to do that, for example, flying from New York to London, is not going to be the same as an aircraft that's flying from Miami to Mexico City. It's possible that, in some cases, that's something that could help \u2013 like a tailwind that pushes a sailing ship.\"\nAiming to decarbonise operations by 2050, the Delta Carbon Council reported that it had saved\u00a041 million\u00a0gallons (65,800 tonnes) of jet fuel in 2024. DeLuca says that to achieve this, Delta is constantly on the lookout for new ways to conserve energy, like plugging into ground power instead of operating engines on the ground, doing a shorter vector on approach instead of a long roundabout when landing, and installing winglets that point up on the tips of wings to reduce drag.\nOther industry practices include\u00a0continuous climb and decline operations\u00a0that enable\u00a0an altitude to be reached without the need for levelling and\u00a0adjusting the centre of gravity\u00a0on the aircraft to reduce drag.\u00a0Switching to a renewable energy source like\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel is also seen as a solution, however this will require a staggering amount of land to grow enough biomass to make biofuels.\u00a0\u00a0\nDeLuca says Delta quadrupled\u00a0its\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel\u00a0(SAF) usage\u00a0in 2024, but that's still less than 1% of the fuel\u00a0being used\u00a0with it.

        "article_text": "Some species of birds like geese save energy by flying in close formation. Airliners could use a similar trick to burn less fuel.\nIn the early 1500s, Italian Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci developed a fascination with avian flight. He spent his days meticulously studying the movement of birds, sketching observations of how they maintain their balance and perform soaring manoeuvres.\nHis ambition was to make a flying machine from his scientific investigations. But what he wound up creating instead was the seminal work\u00a0Codex on the Flight of Birds. It pioneered what would later become the field of \"biomimicry\", the study of the natural world in search of efficient design.\u00a0\nCenturies later, experimentation flourished. Pioneering aviators like Otto Lilienthal, Igo Etrich and the Wright brothers mimicked birds to design their aircraft and the aviation industry was born.\nIn 2019, Airbus returned to the study of birds with the \"fello'fly\" project to understand how migrating geese conserve energy while flying in V formation. From it, a\u00a0\"wake energy retrieval\" technique was developed to help\u00a0trailing jets\u00a0pinpoint the optimal location to fly in the wake vortex of a lead jet. This was found to generate fuel savings of 5% to 10% per\u00a0trip, similar to\u00a0findings published by the US space agency Nasa.\u00a0\nIn July 2023, the effort evolved into the\u00a0Geese project\u00a0with\u00a0\u20ac10m (\u00a38.4m/$10.5m)\u00a0in funding, and support from the European Union's air traffic management research arm, Sesar.\nEarlier this month, Delta Air Lines and Airbus announced that they were taking the \"fello'fly\" concept out of the lab and into the skies, targeting the second half of this year to deploy the technique into live operations. The goal will be to test a manoeuvre called \"rendez-vous\" in which two passenger jets are paired over the Atlantic Ocean. For example, this could be an Air France flight from New York City and a Delta Air Lines flight from Miami, both heading to London. In pairing, the two planes would be separated by the regulatory 1,000ft (303m) in altitude while attempting to\u00a0reduce the distance between them to\u00a01.2 nautical miles (2.2km), the same distance that fuel savings were most recently achieved in the lab.\nDelta chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca tells the BBC that this distance is substantially closer than planes fly today, which is typically at a separation of three to five nautical miles (5.5 to 9.2km), so the first step will be to see whether the gap can be narrowed without compromising safety.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0video\u00a0shows an animation of how \"fello'fly\" is expected to work.\nAs for why transatlantic flights were chosen for the test, DeLuca explains, \"there are very few sustainable solutions for wide bodies flying today, besides sustainable aviation fuel.

        "article_text": "The Treble to the periphery - what's going on with Jack Grealish?\nJack Grealish is at a crossroads.\nThe joint most expensive British footballer ever, Grealish should be looking forward to Manchester City's mouth-watering Champions League play-off round match with Real Madrid on Tuesday.\nBut, if recent experience is any guide, he is likely to be on the bench.\nLast month, the 29-year-old was a sub as Pep Guardiola's men trailed at half-time in their must-win final first-phase game against Club Brugge. But instead of his \u00a3100m man, Guardiola turned to relatively untested Brazilian Savinho - a \u00a330.8m signing from Girona last summer - to lead the salvage operation.\nGrealish did not feature for a single minute.\nGuardiola was not even asked about it afterwards because none of the reporters present were surprised.\nHow did we get here? What has gone wrong for the England international? And is there a way back for him at City?\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone\nJust over a month before the Brugge game, Guardiola delivered a straightforward public message to Grealish, challenging him to prove he deserved to regain his spot and explaining why Savinho was being chosen ahead of him.\n\"Savinho is in better shape and everything than Jack, and that's why I played Savinho,\" he said. \"Do I want the Jack that won the Treble? Yeah I want it, but I try to be honest with myself about that. They have to fight.\n\"You can say it's unfair. If you think that, it's fine, but you have to prove [to me], 'OK, I'm going to fight with Savinho, to deserve to play in that position', every single day, every single week and every single month.\"\nDespite such criticism, Grealish subsequently managed his first goal in more than a year against Salford City in the FA Cup.\nAnd then against PSG he scored for the first time in the Champions League since 2021.\nBut those statistics merely underlined the inescapable sense of drift - and Grealish did not feature again until the FA Cup fourth-round tie at League One Leyton Orient on Saturday.\nGrealish created the 79th-minute winner for Kevin de Bruyne, and afterwards his manager seemed impressed.\n\"Jack is a fighter,\" said Guardiola. \"He didn't play the last games... but the season is still open... against Orient I saw the glimpse that he is going to rebel, to show the manager how wrong he is. I love that.\"\nThat was only the fourth time since October Grealish had featured for a full game however, and he hinted at the toll his struggles at City had taken, reflecting on \"probably the most difficult year of my life for many reasons, on and off the pitch\". \n\"I found it really difficult,\" he added. \"But it's a new year, a sort of fresh start, and hopefully I can kick on from here... \n\"I do find it difficult at times to come in and out of games, not really playing. Hopefully I can keep training well and playing a few more games.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'He's put in a really good performance' Shearer on Grealish\nSome of those close to Grealish emphasise it is not just him that has endured a difficult season - the same can be said for the whole team. They feel Grealish has lost out in Guardiola's desperate search for solutions to the worst period of his managerial career.\nKevin de Bruyne, it has been pointed out, has also been repeatedly overlooked. They also say it is wrong to compare the man who shone for Aston Villa with the current version at City because he has been used very differently.\nIndeed, one referred BBC Sport to the recent comments of former England winger Theo Walcott, who last month said: \"I see a player who has incredible talent that's been absolutely coached out of him. I just feel he's gone away from his strengths. Everything that is Jack Grealish has been trained out of him.\"\nOthers disagree the manager has in some way drilled the creativity out of his player.\n\"He's just got to get on with it,\" says ex-Villa manager Tim Sherwood, who gave a teenage Grealish his first league start 10 years ago, and still speaks regularly to him.\n\"It happens to everyone. He gets into pretty much every other Premier League team. I've no idea what Pep's issue is, but he owes a lot to Pep.\n\"He wants to play, but he knows what to do. He's just got to keep working hard. He'll bounce back, he's a good pro. He's never been 'first choice'. I'm not sure who is at City.\"\nGrealish's struggles to get into City's starting side are nothing new. At the end of last season he admitted his 2023-24 campaign had been \"stop-start\".\n\"We have so many good players here so it's difficult,\" he added. \"There's no team in the world that rotates like this team do, but that's the beauty of it.\"\nBut Guardiola still seems unsure what to make of Grealish, or even where to play him.\nAs recently as early December, the manager praised his performance after playing him in a central role against Nottingham Forest - the one game in a chronic 13-match spell they did win - and even joked he may have made a mistake by previously using him as a winger. \nYet, just a month later, Guardiola publicly suggested the player's standards had slipped, leading to rumours Grealish could leave during the January transfer window.\nThat did not happen, but the arrivals of another forward in Omar Marmoush and central midfielder Nico Gonzalez, plus Oscar Bobb's return to fitness, bring even more competition.\nThis video can not be played\nGuardiola: Jack Grealish must prove he deserves his spot\nSo when did Grealish's fall down the pecking order really begin?\nJust 20 months ago he had been at the centre of City's finest hour, playing every minute of their Champions League final triumph over Inter Milan in Istanbul. He had also played virtually all of the magnificent 4-0 semi-final victory over Real Madrid, and the FA Cup final win against Manchester United.\nGrealish then became the face of City's Treble festivities. His drinking and lack of sleep received much of the attention, and he admitted he had reported \"a bit hungover\" for England duty. \nIt all reinforced the sense of enjoyment, authenticity and openness that has endeared him to fans and team-mates, evoking memories of Paul Gascoigne's flamboyance. But it also risked raising concerns with his coaches.\n\"There is a line,\" said England manager Gareth Southgate, when asked whether it was excessive of Grealish to party for three days - in what many interpreted as a subtle warning to keep the revelry in check.\n\"I don't think it is a party-boy thing,\" Grealish said, when asked whether criticisms over the celebrations had bothered him. \n\"I would never sit here and lie to you and say 'yeah, I don't drink and I don't party' because I do\u2026 I just enjoy myself, I'm living my dream of playing for the best club in the world in my opinion. I knew [what] I was doing, that's just the way I am, I'm like that when I party usually.\"\nBack in 2021, Grealish and Phil Foden were warned over their conduct by Guardiola after the pair were pictured on a night out following a match. Both were then dropped, with the manager saying: \"I pay a lot of attention to behaviour on and off the pitch.\"\nThe following year, however, Guardiola defended a group of his players - including Grealish - when similar images emerged, and there is no evidence he had concerns about the post-Treble celebrations.\nBut what is clear is that was the high point for Grealish. In the 2023-24 season that followed, he made just 10 starts, with three goals and three assists across all competitions. And even after injury issues had cleared up, he was largely overlooked, with Belgium winger Jeremy Doku often preferred.\nGrealish hinted at a post-Treble comedown and, midway through last season, Guardiola suggested the winger needed to improve. \n\"He is the same player, he has the same manager and the way we play has not changed,\" he said. \"It's just the way he has performed. That's the difference.\"\nGrealish certainly seemed more of a free spirit at Aston Villa. Manchester United wanted him, and in 2020, they had a chance, but went for Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek instead. Someone involved at United at the time feels the arrival of Doku in the aftermath of the Champions League triumph might have affected him.\nIt also felt significant that last May, while praising his manager, Grealish admitted: \"I've had times this season that I've struggled off the pitch - I don't mind saying that - and he's been there for me so much.\"\nSome weeks later, he once again referred to personal issues - mentioning injuries, but then adding: \"I also had a lot of, not a lot, but some stuff that happened off the field. Sometimes people from the outside don't see, they just think we just play football and we're these robots but we do have a life off the field as well. And sometimes it's difficult to deal with that.\"\nGrealish was understood to be referring, at least in part, to a robbery at his Cheshire home while some of his family were present and he was away playing in December 2023 - an ordeal he described at the time as a \"traumatic experience\" that left him \"devastated\".\nBut there were further challenges to come. \nGrealish was left \"absolutely heartbroken\" by being left out of Southgate's Euro 2024 squad - a decision he has since made clear he disagreed with. Several people close to the player told BBC Sport its impact on him should not be underestimated.\n\"The treatment that he had from England kicked him sideways, and made a real difference to his confidence,\" said one. \"I know that's had some effect.\"\n\"It hit him like a sledgehammer,\" said another, who has worked closely with Grealish.\n\"He loves playing for England, and when the team is at a major tournament it is inescapable, wherever you are in the world. I know he found that hard.\"\nThis video can not be played\nGrealish 'heartbroken' about not being in England Euro 2024 squad\nGrealish responded to the snub by setting up his own summer training camp using Juventus' facilities, and refused the offer of additional time off. He clearly wanted to hit the ground running - but, while he did well on a pre-season tour in the United States, he was outshone by Norwegian youngster Bobb.\nEngland's interim manager Lee Carsley recalled Grealish - starting him against the Republic of Ireland and Finland in September, then against Finland again the following month, with the City man scoring twice across the three games.\nBut his return to the international fold also frustrated Guardiola, with the coach annoyed England had again selected Grealish in November, despite his struggles with fitness.\n\"I'm always pleased for players to go - when they are fit and they haven't struggled for the past one, two, three or four weeks,\" said Guardiola at the time. \"In 17 days he didn't train once... Jack has had two or three setbacks in terms of injuries and could not get his rhythm.\" Grealish subsequently withdrew.\nIf his confidence has been dented by Guardiola's pointed remarks, he would not be the first at City. Last year, Kalvin Phillips - another England international who struggled to convince his manager, despite costing the club \u00a342m when signed from Leeds in 2022 - admitted he had been hurt by criticism over his weight. \nGuardiola later apologised, but it is clear his intensity and exacting standards can come at a cost.\nAccording to those who know him, Grealish is a popular figure within the dressing room, grateful for what his talent has given him, and a man who does not take himself too seriously. They claim he is also the player most likely to stop and talk to fans on site visits.\nAs his sister Hollie has cerebral palsy, there was something deeply personal about the friendship he struck up with young City fan Finlay Fisher - who also has the condition - that led to him doing a goal celebration in the 2022 World Cup in his honour. It fits with Grealish's description of himself as \"relatable\" in a recent film posted on the City website. \"There's no filter,\" he added.\nThose who knew him at Villa speak about a confident yet humble young man who would take his time with fans and staff at the club, asking about their families and how they were.\nThe humanity he showed belied the popular, trendy and handsome image in the headlines. \"His authenticity came through,\" said one who worked with him.\nShaun Derry, who managed Grealish when he was a 17-year-old on loan at Notts Country in 2013-14, says he \"misses seeing the old Jack\".\nIn League One he made 37 appearances and scored five goals, with Derry witnessing the development of a young talent first hand.\n\"I felt I saw two Jacks really,\" he told BBC Sport. \"One was this real young, immature kid who needed to quickly understand what we was looking to do at Notts County. Of course there was an immature Jack, he was 17.\n\"So it's really easy to understand looking back now, what that looked like, but there was an unbelievable confidence and bravery and individuality on the pitch.\n\"When he's looking back at his career he's going to see an absolute top level one, championships, experiences, international football. People will look back and probably look more fondly at Jack as they do now.\"\nGrealish never pushed to leave Villa, his boyhood club, even after Tottenham circled following the club's relegation in 2016.\nHe stayed to help them return to the Premier League in 2019 and is viewed as being instrumental in Villa's recovery with an unshakeable belief in his talent described as \"infectious\".\n\"He allowed others to feel things were possible,\" said one former Villa employee.\nThis video can not be played\nGuardiola was a 'massive factor' in Grealish joining Man City\nHowever, some close to Grealish also feel Guardiola simply doesn't 'get' the England international. That he has still not worked him out. \nThe worry for Grealish would be if the manager has stopped trying to. And with the coach committed to City for another two seasons after this, the next few weeks will shape whether Grealish is there with him or not.\n\"I think it is pretty simple,\" former Premier League striker Chris Sutton said. \"Jack's a level-headed lad and he knows he needs to prove himself to Pep - he knows he needs to get his head down and play well.\n\"You suspect with what has gone on that he may be surplus to requirements in the summer, but he always seems a decent guy who accepts his situation, and he knows he needs game time to show he has a future with City.\"\nThe year 2024 was notable for Grealish in other ways, becoming a father for the first time when his partner Sasha Attwood gave birth to a daughter in September.\n\"I would have thought that would be good thing, and calmed him down,\" said one friend. \"He's always had lots of friends and activities. But now family and football are his focus.\"\nCommercially, Grealish continues to enjoy great success, on top of the \u00a315 million annual salary he is estimated to earn from City. Last year Kelandan - the image rights company he owns with his father Kevin - filed accounts showing \u00a310.5million in assets,, external an annual increase from \u00a33.4m, after a string of sponsorship deals with the likes of Gucci, Bose, Puma and Hellmann's. \nHowever, a sign of the on-pitch frustration Grealish has felt at times this season came after defeat against his boyhood club at Villa Park in December, when he was known to be upset after being booed and heckled by some of the fans who once adored him.\nGrealish responded by holding up three fingers - believed to be a reference to the number of Premier League titles he has won since joining City. But, in reality, he has had little to boast about this campaign.\nAnd as he approaches his 30th birthday, he faces a major challenge to revitalise his career for both club and country, and live up to the price tag and expectation his talents once generated.\nAdditional reporting by Chris Bevan",

        "article_text": "Food is life for this meal-obsessed island, especially when you're feeling poorly \u2013 including a spicy soup that soothes flu symptoms and a beloved chocolate drink that brings comfort.\nA few years ago, my girlfriend and I landed in Singapore after a winter holiday in Europe. Coughing, dizzy, our throats rusty and inflamed, we were far from well. But help was at hand. My (future) Singaporean mother-in-law came to the rescue, stocking our fridge with liquid medicine: congee. We spooned the thick, savoury rice porridge down our throats, feeling a little better with every swallow.\u00a0\nWarm and filling but gentle on the stomach, in good times congee is a power dinner in and of itself, and endlessly remixable. You can top it with a runny egg, chopped chives and coriander or neon splashes of garlic-chilli oil, and eat like a king. Or when sick, you can cut the tempting add-ons to a bare minimum and still be left with the soothing starch and heat. No wonder congee and its cousins are a key flu go-to in Singapore, Malaysia, China, South Korea \u2013 almost any place in East Asia where rice is a staple.\nSo strong is this porridge's connection to illness that some people can only stomach it when they're under the weather. Like Yuri Cath, a Japanese Indonesian who recently became a Singaporean citizen. \"I had a negative association with congee for the longest time because I only had it when I was sick,\" she says, echoing a sentiment of many locals. \"So, having it kind of made me feel ill.\" Not for long though, she laughs \u2013 the flavours won her over again, \"and I love congee now\".\nIt's tempting to call congee the king of flu food, but this is Singapore, one of the\u00a0most culinary-obsessed nations on Earth, and competition is fierce. A literal melting pot, the island's official languages are English, Tamil, Malay and Mandarin, representing the many cultures that form its core population. Each brings with it enough comfort dishes to soothe an army.\nWhere to eat yourself well in Singapore\nCongee:\u00a0Variety is the name of the game at\u00a0Mui Kee Congee, where your porridge can come loaded with sliced pork, beef, fish balls or abalone, to name just a few options.\n\nRasam:\u00a0Banana Leaf Apolo\u00a0boasts several locations, including one in the heart of Singapore's Little India. Their menu is extensive, but leave room for this stomach-settling dish.\nTamarind:\u00a0Looking for a food souvenir? Visit\u00a0DriedFoodSG, a multi-generation business brimming with dried goods, including tamarind paste or slices, which can be added to stews for an unmistakable flavour boost.\nBak kut teh:\u00a0Multiple businesses fight for the claim of best bak kut teh on bustling Balestier Road, including\u00a0Kai Juan Eating House\u00a0and the aptly named\u00a0Balestier Bak Kut Teh. The latter is open 24 hours a day.\nMilo:\u00a0Head to\u00a0Toast Box, a local cafe chain with more than 80 outlets famed as a popular pre-work breakfast spot. Order Milo hot or cold with kaya toast (bread with sweet coconut spread) on the side. A sugary but comforting pick-me-up.\nHippocrates would have liked this nation of six million hungry souls. The Ancient Greek thinker and physician, who once said, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,\" could witness his words come alive as a daily habit in Singapore's restaurants, homes and 120\u00a0hawker centres\u00a0boasting 6,000 stalls. Below are just some of the health-giving dishes and ingredients Hippocrates would approve of.\nSingaporean Syazana Izzati has vivid memories of her mother taking care of her when she was a child. Not with prescription pills, but with a long-held Malay practice that uses food as medicine.\n\"Whenever my siblings and I were running a fever, she used to do this thing where she'd wet our foreheads and hair,\" Izzati recalls. \"As we were lying down on bed, with a towel placed on our brow, she'd wet it with tamarind water.\" Why tamarind, or\u00a0asam\u00a0as it's known in Malay? \"Because it has cooling effects,\" she explains, \"and lowers the body temperature.\"\nTraditional Malay Medicine, like many ancient healing methods across Asia, leans deeply on jamu, or herbal and plant-based treatments like Izzati's fever poultice. \"These days, I just rely on painkillers,\" she laughs. But that may change, she says. Should she have children, she'll turn to tamarind on their feverish days \u2013 just like her mother and grandmother before her.\nBut tamarind is too popular to be used as a poultice alone. Some ingredients are so revered they crop up in other healing dishes, from cultures thousands of miles away.\nSome 5% of Singapore's population is made up of people with Indian Tamil heritage, who regularly turn to one of the tastiest flu cures you can fit in a bowl. Colourful but light, rasam, a broth originating in South India, is more than the sum of its parts. Its base consists of spices like pepper, turmeric and cumin along with garlic, onions and tomatoes \u2013 and, yes, tamarind again, in this case acting as a souring agent that gives the broth its addictive tart flavour. As a paper by two Indian medical researchers notes, rasam's ingredients are so therapeutic that the dish constitutes a \"functional food\", whose ingredients provide benefits above and beyond their nutritional value.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda\u00a0noted\u00a0when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation. Troubled by his ailing son's health and waning appetite, an ancient king of Madurai in Tamil Nadu province offered a reward for anyone who could make his child eat. One enterprising chef presented a humble bowl of rasam, which was promptly slurped up by the patient. Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda noted when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation.

Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nToday it remains a popular pick-me-up from the flu and is prized particularly for its decongestant properties. Bak kut teh is often eaten late at night, when the day is cooler. That's because it's considered a \"heaty\" soup in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) due to its herbal make-up. The spectrum of internal \"heatiness\" and \"cooling\" are core concepts within TCM, a popular practice in Singapore. Excessive heatiness, for example, may see the body erupt in a fever, sore throat and irritability, while the inverse can lead to paleness and fatigue. The key is to balance your warm yang energy with yin, its cooler counterpart.\nAce Tan, head chef at the newly opened fine-dining restaurant ASU, is a strong believer in this balance. His childhood was steeped in the ancient health system: Ace would often visit TCM stores run by his aunts and uncles. It spurred a passion in him to understand what ingredients affected the body, and how. \"The practice of consuming specific ingredients during each season is deeply rooted in the Asian philosophy of the five elements,\" Ace says: \"wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements are intricately connected to our body systems. By consuming certain ingredients, we nourish specific body parts, ensuring a continuous cycle of cultivation and overall well-being.\"\nSo how does Ace cool himself down when balance is disrupted? \"I do have a strong affiliation\u00a0towards\u00a0two drinks in particular,\" he says, both commonly drunk as teas: \"chrysanthemum and barley, as they help mitigate the heat of my body system, preventing sore throats and fever.\"\nSometimes, however, you just need comfort above all. That's where Milo comes in, a chocolate drink sold in practically every hawker centre in town. The brand is so beloved that a paper at the National University of Singapore Centre for Governance and Sustainability dryly noted: \"It has even humorously been suggested that Milo flows through the veins of Singaporeans.\"\nThey're not wrong. During the Covid-19 pandemic, ad-hoc medical centres gave thousands of patients a care package with critical necessities such as toothpaste, crackers \u2013 and sachets of Milo powder.\nThough it originated in Australia in the 1930s, Milo became popular in many British colonies in Asia, including Singapore. In a 2019 lecture at the National Museum of Singapore, historian Dr Geoffrey Pakiam explained how, once the island achieved independence in the mid-1960s (first from Britain, and then from the Federation of Malaysia, which it briefly joined), Milo was marketed \"as a national drink\". In 1984, Milo began to be manufactured locally as well, further cementing a homegrown connection with the beverage.\nWhat makes this best-selling drink such a treat for the poorly? In part, it's because Milo is an embedded part of childhood, served at school canteens, birthday parties and picnics. That connection continues as people age or join mandatory National Service (NS). Loong Lim, who served his NS decades ago, shares that \"for a lot of guys, Milo will still bring back memories of the night snack you get in the army, when training ends late.\" Drunk by young Singaporeans drenched in sweat and mud, Milo has revived many a tired soldier, who will likely serve it to their child one day should illness strike. Followed, perhaps, by a soothing bowl of congee.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Scientists and industry are finding unusual new uses for brewers' spent grain \u2013 the beer industry's largest waste product.\nPonder the idea of a beer well-brewed and enthusiastic drinkers at least are likely to imagine a pint glass filled to the brim with golden nectar.\u00a0\nWhat they probably won't picture is the mountains of wet sticky shavings that pile up as the largest waste material of brewing beer.\nThis is what's known as brewers' spent grain, and there is an awful lot of it. Around 200g (7oz) is produced for every litre of beer brewed. Globally some 37 million tonnes is produced each year \u2013 equivalent to the weight of around 340 double-decker buses per hour. And as we drink more beer \u2013 sales are expected to rise by a third in the next seven years \u2013 only more and more will be churned out.\nMost brewers' spent grain, around 70% of it, is currently repurposed as cattle feed, while 10% is used to make biogas. Around a fifth is simply sent straight to landfill \u2013 at an additional cost to breweries \u2013 where it rots and releases methane into the atmosphere.\nBut inside this beer by-product there are a mountain of useful chemicals to tap, including lots of protein. Researchers and companies are now beginning to explore how these could be put to better use.\u00a0\nSwiss start-up Upgrain is one of these. In 2024, it launched a processing system to turn brewers' spent grain into protein and fibre, passed as fit for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and the European Food Safety Authority (brewers' spent grain is, after all, still just grain). The system comes ready for installation on brewery premises: shipping container-sized for micro-breweries and a much larger unit for the likes of Brauerei Locher, Switzerland's second biggest brewer, which opened in September 2024 and is now building Europe's largest onsite facility.\nWilliam Beiskjaer, Upgrain's co-founder, argues brewers spent grain is a \"kind of hidden treasure in terms of sustainable and healthy nutrition\". He says it could help to tackle rising global demand for protein. \"There's more and more demand for our foods to be enhanced, especially to get more protein and fibre in our diets,\" he says.\nUpgrain and other producers such as Agrain in Denmark and BiaSol in Ireland are already selling brewers' spent grain protein and fibre extract to food manufacturers for inclusion in baked goods, pizzas, granola and even crisps. It's also being used in plant-based meat alternatives, such as those launched last year by the Swiss supermarket chain Migros, and in a coffee created by Singapore-based company Prefer.\nHype Metre\nBrewers' spent grain is a rich source of nutrients which is arguably wasted as cattle feed and produces methane when it ends up in landfill. A host of start-ups are now using it to make everything from vegan barley milk and leather to baked goods, crisps and even coffee; it even has potential to be used in areas like construction, cosmetics and paper.\nNot all these products are yet past the early stages of development, and products could struggle to see widespread consumer acceptance. Brewers' spent grain also uses lots of energy to process and spoils fast. Scientists and developers are already working to overcome these issues, however.\nHuge brewers such as the Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev and Chicago-based Molson Coors have even created their own vegan barley milk spin-offs made from spent grain. Molson Coors claims its Golden Wing product has a \"rich and creamy taste\" and 25% less sugar than most oat milks.\u00a0\n\"This is an exciting new idea,\" says Beiskjaer. \"If you'd have said to me four years ago that brewers' spent grain would be a [human] food source, I'd have asked what you were talking about. But we're on the way to seeing upcycled BSG as a staple in the food industry.\"\nBeiskjaer says he can see why some people may be squeamish about the notion of \"upcycled food\". \"But we have to get across the idea that brewers' spent grain is not a\u00a0waste\u00a0product,\" he says. \"It's being saved from being a waste product.\"\nMaking use of this waste product to make plant-based protein could in theory also free up the small amounts of arable farmland used to grow wheat, soy and pea for human protein \u2013 or, if it replaced meat, a far larger amount of land. \u00c4io, a biotech start-up based in Tallin, Estonia is using brewers' spent grain and other food and agricultural waste products to develop an alternative to palm oil, a major driver of deforestation in Indonesia and other countries. To do this \u00c4io grows fatty acid-making microorganisms and applies these to a fermentation process not dissimilar to that used in brewing beer.\nThere are some caveats to using brewers' spent grain in food, however. Since it is loaded with moisture and so spoils quickly, using it close to where it is produced is essential. This is one reason why a good proportion ends up in landfill: there's not enough demand from local farmers to meet supply. That dampness risks mould and microbial infection. In fact, says Beiskjaer, \"it becomes the perfect environment for bacteria unless it's quickly preserved\". Techniques for making preservation easier are now being explored.\nBut nutrition isn't the only area where spent grain could make an impact.\nBrett Cotten concedes that early efforts by his young London-based company, Arda Biomaterials, to create leather-alternatives from brewers' spent grain resulted in something more akin to a flapjack.\u00a0\nBut the start-up has since successfully used supramolecular chemistry to make several proteins from brewers' spent grain that mimic the animal proteins in leather, resulting in a strong and supple alternative. The colour reflects the spent grain used, he says. \"Guinness and stouts make for a naturally black material, IPAs and lagers more mid-browns.\"\u00a0\nCotten argues that to date many leather alternatives have either not been as environmentally sound as promised or are not scalable enough to replace animal leather. In contrast, he says, Arda's first test material was made in a home lab using standard kitchen equipment, using the abundant feedstock that is brewers' spent grain.\nSo far staff at the company and a local brewery have wear-trialled this new material with bags and cardholders. Current production is at lab scale, but a pilot facility set to open in London in 2025 will allow it to produce up to 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) a year, the company says.\nArda's own estimates suggest that, were a facility tied to a single major brewing plant \u2013 the likes of one run by Heineken or InBev \u2013 all of the spent grain being produced by the plant could make for 5-10 million sq m (54,000-108 sq ft) of its mid-range faux-leather, suitable for use in fashion and the automotive upholstery industries. Tied to, say, three major brewing facilities, it could undercut the cost of both real and plastics-based synthetic leathers, it argues. Cotten estimates that just 10% of global brewers' spent grain output would satisfy the global demand for leather.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Of course, the look and feel [of our material] is important, but so is scalability,\" says Cotten. \"The fashion industry just wants a new option [to animal or current bioleathers]. And while it's often happy to work with a batch of proof-of-concept material for a small collection, you have to be able to produce at scale to be of real interest.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The controversial device trapping CO2 in the ocean\n\u2022 What we've learned since Deepwater Horizon\n\u2022 The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery\nThat comes with a cost, however. Processing brewers' spent grain typically involves mechanical methods \u2013 using high pressure and temperature and spinning the grain in a centrifuge \u2013 or the use of strong acids and alkalis, all of which\u00a0are energy-intensive and can raise their own environmental questions. There is therefore an ongoing exploration of cheaper and more sophisticated methods to extract protein from spent grain, such as the use of bacteria and fungal enzymes to break down chemical bonds, for example.\u00a0\nLast year, a team in Singapore, funded by Heineken Asia, unveiled the use of fermentation to break down the chemical bonds in spent grain, which also resulted in the extracted protein \u2013 for use in foodstuffs \u2013 being richer in nutrients and fatty acids. In another step that might be widely applied, the researchers heated the spent grain using microwaves and found they could extract over 80% of its available protein content this way, the most harvested to date.\n\"Using microwaves is a difficult challenge, in their energy requirements, efficiency and scalability,\" says William Chen, professor of food science and technology at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore. \"But it's certainly possible to scale up [a microwave approach], or to find other ways of applying heat, through vibration, for example.\"\nThe overall objective is to move towards an \"ever more functional, higher value products\", he says. \"And we should be doing the same with [other protein-rich waste products such as] soybean residue, for example,\" he adds.\nArda's experiments may prove to be just the first steps in exploring the potential of spent grain beyond the edible. Antioxidant-rich brewers' spent grain could provide an eco-friendly alternative to the chemicals used in cosmetics, for instance, or used to replace the virgin fibres used in paper making.\u00a0\nRosa Arrigo, associate professor in inorganic chemistry at the University of Salford in the UK, says brewers' spent grain has a \"niche composition that's rich in chemicals [that] certainly have potential to [in time] be used to produce new materials\". Work at Salford to extract various organic compounds from brewers' spent grain is ongoing and Arrigo envisages these being used to make robust composite materials that could, for example, be bindable to the likes of concrete to make it stronger, more lightweight and more sustainable.\u00a0\n\"Certainly there's a whole other layer to what brewers' spent grain could bring beyond protein extraction for food,\" says Arrigo. \"Exactly what that is what we're now starting to examine.\" Doing this, though, could be expensive and complex, she adds. \"So we need further investigation to understand really what we have here, and what's actually needed by industry: what's good enough in terms of its quality but also economically feasible.\"\u00a0\nThe development of one such material is already underway: a group of researchers coordinated by University of Perugia, Italy, is currently working on a bioplastic derived from brewers' spent grain.\nCurrently, spent grain usually needs to be dried before it can be further processed, which is both time and energy consuming. But the Perugia team has developed a means of processing it while wet, critical to developing a bioplastic that could improve on the mechanical properties of those already available. The so-called Polymeer project hopes to have its first product \u2013 perhaps a biodegradable film wrap that could be used in packaging and agriculture \u2013 within four years.\n\"I think the true potential of brewers' spent grain has been overlooked, because even when the protein is removed there's still a lot of [useful] waste, the likes of lignin and cellulose, that has the potential to be a raw material [for other purposes],\" says Assunta Marrocchi associate professor in biotechnology at the University of Perugia and Polymeer's project coordinator. \"And the extraction of its additional components seems to be possible by relatively easy, low energy methods.\"\nBut what really matters here she adds, is that \"because almost everyone drinks beer, there's just so much of it to work with. It really is an incredible feedstock\".\nSo, the next time you're in the pub, perhaps you'll find yourself considering how the undertaking that put the beer in your glass might just prove an unexpected game-changer to both our diets and the materials we use.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Scientists and industry are finding unusual new uses for brewers' spent grain \u2013 the beer industry's largest waste product.\nPonder the idea of a beer well-brewed and enthusiastic drinkers at least are likely to imagine a pint glass filled to the brim with golden nectar.\u00a0\nWhat they probably won't picture is the mountains of wet sticky shavings that pile up as the largest waste material of brewing beer.\nThis is what's known as brewers' spent grain, and there is an awful lot of it. Around 200g (7oz) is produced for every litre of beer brewed. Globally some 37 million tonnes is produced each year \u2013 equivalent to the weight of around 340 double-decker buses per hour. And as we drink more beer \u2013 sales are expected to rise by a third in the next seven years \u2013 only more and more will be churned out.\nMost brewers' spent grain, around 70% of it, is currently repurposed as cattle feed, while 10% is used to make biogas. Around a fifth is simply sent straight to landfill \u2013 at an additional cost to breweries \u2013 where it rots and releases methane into the atmosphere.\nBut inside this beer by-product there are a mountain of useful chemicals to tap, including lots of protein. Researchers and companies are now beginning to explore how these could be put to better use.\u00a0\nSwiss start-up Upgrain is one of these. In 2024, it launched a processing system to turn brewers' spent grain into protein and fibre, passed as fit for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and the European Food Safety Authority (brewers' spent grain is, after all, still just grain). The system comes ready for installation on brewery premises: shipping container-sized for micro-breweries and a much larger unit for the likes of Brauerei Locher, Switzerland's second biggest brewer, which opened in September 2024 and is now building Europe's largest onsite facility.\nWilliam Beiskjaer, Upgrain's co-founder, argues brewers spent grain is a \"kind of hidden treasure in terms of sustainable and healthy nutrition\". He says it could help to tackle rising global demand for protein. \"There's more and more demand for our foods to be enhanced, especially to get more protein and fibre in our diets,\" he says.\nUpgrain and other producers such as Agrain in Denmark and BiaSol in Ireland are already selling brewers' spent grain protein and fibre extract to food manufacturers for inclusion in baked goods, pizzas, granola and even crisps. It's also being used in plant-based meat alternatives, such as those launched last year by the Swiss supermarket chain Migros, and in a coffee created by Singapore-based company Prefer.\nHype Metre\nBrewers' spent grain is a rich source of nutrients which is arguably wasted as cattle feed and produces methane when it ends up in landfill. A host of start-ups are now using it to make everything from vegan barley milk and leather to baked goods, crisps and even coffee; it even has potential to be used in areas like construction, cosmetics and paper.\nNot all these products are yet past the early stages of development, and products could struggle to see widespread consumer acceptance. Brewers' spent grain also uses lots of energy to process and spoils fast. Scientists and developers are already working to overcome these issues, however.\nHuge brewers such as the Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev and Chicago-based Molson Coors have even created their own vegan barley milk spin-offs made from spent grain. Molson Coors claims its Golden Wing product has a \"rich and creamy taste\" and 25% less sugar than most oat milks.\u00a0\n\"This is an exciting new idea,\" says Beiskjaer. \"If you'd have said to me four years ago that brewers' spent grain would be a [human] food source, I'd have asked what you were talking about. But we're on the way to seeing upcycled BSG as a staple in the food industry.\"\nBeiskjaer says he can see why some people may be squeamish about the notion of \"upcycled food\". \"But we have to get across the idea that brewers' spent grain is not a\u00a0waste\u00a0product,\" he says. \"It's being saved from being a waste product.\"\nMaking use of this waste product to make plant-based protein could in theory also free up the small amounts of arable farmland used to grow wheat, soy and pea for human protein \u2013 or, if it replaced meat, a far larger amount of land. \u00c4io, a biotech start-up based in Tallin, Estonia is using brewers' spent grain and other food and agricultural waste products to develop an alternative to palm oil, a major driver of deforestation in Indonesia and other countries. To do this \u00c4io grows fatty acid-making microorganisms and applies these to a fermentation process not dissimilar to that used in brewing beer.\nThere are some caveats to using brewers' spent grain in food, however. Since it is loaded with moisture and so spoils quickly, using it close to where it is produced is essential. This is one reason why a good proportion ends up in landfill: there's not enough demand from local farmers to meet supply. That dampness risks mould and microbial infection. In fact, says Beiskjaer, \"it becomes the perfect environment for bacteria unless it's quickly preserved\". Techniques for making preservation easier are now being explored.\nBut nutrition isn't the only area where spent grain could make an impact.\nBrett Cotten concedes that early efforts by his young London-based company, Arda Biomaterials, to create leather-alternatives from brewers' spent grain resulted in something more akin to a flapjack.\u00a0\nBut the start-up has since successfully used supramolecular chemistry to make several proteins from brewers' spent grain that mimic the animal proteins in leather, resulting in a strong and supple alternative. The colour reflects the spent grain used, he says. \"Guinness and stouts make for a naturally black material, IPAs and lagers more mid-browns.\"\u00a0\nCotten argues that to date many leather alternatives have either not been as environmentally sound as promised or are not scalable enough to replace animal leather. In contrast, he says, Arda's first test material was made in a home lab using standard kitchen equipment, using the abundant feedstock that is brewers' spent grain.\nSo far staff at the company and a local brewery have wear-trialled this new material with bags and cardholders. Current production is at lab scale, but a pilot facility set to open in London in 2025 will allow it to produce up to 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) a year, the company says.\nArda's own estimates suggest that, were a facility tied to a single major brewing plant \u2013 the likes of one run by Heineken or InBev \u2013 all of the spent grain being produced by the plant could make for 5-10 million sq m (54,000-108 sq ft) of its mid-range faux-leather, suitable for use in fashion and the automotive upholstery industries. Tied to, say, three major brewing facilities, it could undercut the cost of both real and plastics-based synthetic leathers, it argues. Cotten estimates that just 10% of global brewers' spent grain output would satisfy the global demand for leather.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Of course, the look and feel [of our material] is important, but so is scalability,\" says Cotten. \"The fashion industry just wants a new option [to animal or current bioleathers]. And while it's often happy to work with a batch of proof-of-concept material for a small collection, you have to be able to produce at scale to be of real interest.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The controversial device trapping CO2 in the ocean\n\u2022 What we've learned since Deepwater Horizon\n\u2022 The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery\nThat comes with a cost, however. Processing brewers' spent grain typically involves mechanical methods \u2013 using high pressure and temperature and spinning the grain in a centrifuge \u2013 or the use of strong acids and alkalis, all of which\u00a0are energy-intensive and can raise their own environmental questions. There is therefore an ongoing exploration of cheaper and more sophisticated methods to extract protein from spent grain, such as the use of bacteria and fungal enzymes to break down chemical bonds, for example.\u00a0\nLast year, a team in Singapore, funded by Heineken Asia, unveiled the use of fermentation to break down the chemical bonds in spent grain, which also resulted in the extracted protein \u2013 for use in foodstuffs \u2013 being richer in nutrients and fatty acids. In another step that might be widely applied, the researchers heated the spent grain using microwaves and found they could extract over 80% of its available protein content this way, the most harvested to date.\n\"Using microwaves is a difficult challenge, in their energy requirements, efficiency and scalability,\" says William Chen, professor of food science and technology at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore. \"But it's certainly possible to scale up [a microwave approach], or to find other ways of applying heat, through vibration, for example.\"\nThe overall objective is to move towards an \"ever more functional, higher value products\", he says. \"And we should be doing the same with [other protein-rich waste products such as] soybean residue, for example,\" he adds.\nArda's experiments may prove to be just the first steps in exploring the potential of spent grain beyond the edible. Antioxidant-rich brewers' spent grain could provide an eco-friendly alternative to the chemicals used in cosmetics, for instance, or used to replace the virgin fibres used in paper making.\u00a0\nRosa Arrigo, associate professor in inorganic chemistry at the University of Salford in the UK, says brewers' spent grain has a \"niche composition that's rich in chemicals [that] certainly have potential to [in time] be used to produce new materials\". Work at Salford to extract various organic compounds from brewers' spent grain is ongoing and Arrigo envisages these being used to make robust composite materials that could, for example, be bindable to the likes of concrete to make it stronger, more lightweight and more sustainable.\u00a0\n\"Certainly there's a whole other layer to what brewers' spent grain could bring beyond protein extraction for food,\" says Arrigo. \"Exactly what that is what we're now starting to examine.\" Doing this, though, could be expensive and complex, she adds. \"So we need further investigation to understand really what we have here, and what's actually needed by industry: what's good enough in terms of its quality but also economically feasible.\"\u00a0\nThe development of one such material is already underway: a group of researchers coordinated by University of Perugia, Italy, is currently working on a bioplastic derived from brewers' spent grain.\nCurrently, spent grain usually needs to be dried before it can be further processed, which is both time and energy consuming. But the Perugia team has developed a means of processing it while wet, critical to developing a bioplastic that could improve on the mechanical properties of those already available. The so-called Polymeer project hopes to have its first product \u2013 perhaps a biodegradable film wrap that could be used in packaging and agriculture \u2013 within four years.\n\"I think the true potential of brewers' spent grain has been overlooked, because even when the protein is removed there's still a lot of [useful] waste, the likes of lignin and cellulose, that has the potential to be a raw material [for other purposes],\" says Assunta Marrocchi associate professor in biotechnology at the University of Perugia and Polymeer's project coordinator. \"And the extraction of its additional components seems to be possible by relatively easy, low energy methods.\"\nBut what really matters here she adds, is that \"because almost everyone drinks beer, there's just so much of it to work with. It really is an incredible feedstock\".\nSo, the next time you're in the pub, perhaps you'll find yourself considering how the undertaking that put the beer in your glass might just prove an unexpected game-changer to both our diets and the materials we use.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Scientists have cracked the perfect way to boil an egg \u2013 astonishingly, it takes half an hour.\nIt is one of the undisputed facts of life that it is notoriously difficult to cook a perfectly boiled egg. Breakfasts can often be disappointing affairs when, after cracking the shell and dipping your toasted soldier into what you hope will be a culinary delight, you instead find that your yolk is dry and crumbly, or even worse, the egg white is a slimy watery mess.\nThe problem is that the yolk and albumen (the white part of the egg) cook at two different temperatures. Yolk requires a temperature of just 65C (149F) to cook, while the albumen needs a little more heat at 85C (185F).\nConventional methods for cooking eggs, therefore, represent a compromise between those two seemingly incompatible truths. Hard-boil an egg at 100C (212F), and the white will soon become tender and just right. The yolk, however, will be fully set \u2013 which is alright if you like that sort of thing, but disappointing if you're after a soft, runny yolk. Another method of cooking an egg, known as sous vide, involves placing the egg in a water bath at temperatures between 60 and 70C (140-158F) for one hour. This leaves the yolk deliciously runny, but the white can be left slimy and clear.\nHowever, worry not, as researchers have now discovered the perfect method for boiling an egg. What's more, they have shown that the result is not only tastier, but better for you too.\nHow easy is the method to follow?\nI like a runny yolk, so to find out if the periodic method really works, I convinced my husband \u2013 who used to work as a professional chef \u2013 to try it. Although, at first, he was aghast at the idea of boiling an egg for 32 minutes, he diligently performed the instructions as close to the letter as possible. The result, considering the effort he put in, was slightly disappointing. Although the white was pleasingly firm and less watery than that of a soft-boiled egg, the yolk was not runny enough for my taste. It didn\u2019t ooze in the way it ought to. But perhaps one or two minutes less would have made all the difference.\nIn their new paper, researchers led by Pellegrino Musto, a scientist working at Italy's National Research Council in Pozzuoli, first simulated the egg-cooking process using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD is the science of using computers to predict how liquids and gases flow based on the physical laws governing them, such as conservation of mass, momentum and energy.\nThe simulations suggested a new method \u2013 one likely to be entirely unfamiliar to most chefs and amateur cooks \u2013 that might give superior results. The approach, which the authors call periodic cooking, involves alternating between cooking the egg in a pan of boiling water kept at 100C (212F), and placing it into a luke-warm bowl kept at 30C (86F). To get the best results, the egg must be transferred between the two temperatures every two minutes for a total duration of 32 minutes, so it is probably not best suited to home cooks who like to dip in and out of the kitchen leaving their egg unsupervised.\nIf you are willing to put in the effort, however, your rewards will be plentiful. When scientists tried the new method in real life, the resulting egg was exceptional. The researchers confirmed this superiority by analysing the texture, sensory qualities and chemical structure of their perfectly boiled egg using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.\nThe results showed that periodically cooked eggs had a soft yolk similar to that of a sous vide egg \u2013 so far so good. However, unlike eggs cooked sous vide, the white albumen was not runny and uncooked, but instead had a consistency closer to that of a traditionally soft-boiled egg. According to the paper's authors, this is probably because, while temperatures in the periodically cooked egg white ranged between 35C (95F) and 100C (212F) during cooking, the yolk remained at a consistent temperature of 67C (153F) throughout.\nPerhaps most interestingly, chemical analysis revealed that the yolk of periodically cooked eggs contained more polyphenols \u2013 a group of micronutrients mostly found in plants, and touted for their health benefits \u2013 than eggs cooked by other methods. This class of compounds is renowned for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Plants make them as a defence against stressful environmental conditions such as UV radiation, droughts or predation by insects. However, research increasingly shows they can benefit humans too. For example epidemiological studies suggest that high dietary intake of polyphenols is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, specific forms of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.\nEven more reason to try periodically cooked eggs next time you fancy dippy eggs and soldiers for breakfast.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The world's only museum dedicated to the history and culture of the Gulf of Mexico may be in hot water following Trump's decision to change the name of the planet's largest gulf.\nLast year Karen Poth decided it was time to rename the museum she runs in Mobile, Alabama, to better reflect its unique status.\nTo do so, she first had to line up support from elected officials and her board of directors before raising money for the project. Next, she needed to update the museum's website, logo and printed materials. Then in April 2024, she finally unveiled the new name in letters stretching 50ft across the eight-storey building: the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, the only museum in the world dedicated to the history, folklore and culture of the largest gulf on Earth.\nSo, imagine her response when US President Donald Trump recently announced that he planned to rename the body of water to the south of the US from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. \"My personality is to laugh,\" Poth said. \"Or else you cry.\"\nThe name change, which was signed into law on 20 January and is part of a broader Trump effort to \"honour American greatness\", has created an international firestorm. After Google recently announced that it would follow Trump's executive order and also change the Gulf's name on Google Maps in the US, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argued that Trump alone cannot legally do that.\nPoth says she's not taking sides, but admits she's overwhelmed at the thought of what would happen if the museum had to change every reference to the Gulf of America. \"It would be a complete redo of the entire museum. If you think about it, every audio, every video, every digital, every sign\u2026 that will be very, very expensive.\"\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nSince the museum is owned by the city of Mobile, Poth said she will ultimately follow city officials' leads. \"If I need to change the name of the museum, we'll be up there changing the signage on the top of the building.\" The museum still carries debt from its opening a decade ago, and Poth estimates that changing the museum's name in 2024 cost nearly $100,000.\nBut as visitors to the museum learn, the Gulf has actually had many names throughout its multi-cultural history. The name Gulf of Mexico, for example, first appeared on Spanish maps in the mid-1500s as a way of honouring the Mexica people who founded the Aztec empire. Yet, the 218,000-sq-mile oceanic basin \u2013 which borders five US states and a longer stretch of shoreline along the eastern coast of Mexico, along with the north-west coast of Cuba \u2013 has had other names too.\nAccording to John Sledge, the museum's maritime historian in residence, when the Spanish first reached the Gulf in 1513, they thought they had found a route to Asia and initially called it the Chinese Sea (a name unlikely to appeal to Trump, Sledge noted). Other early explorers called it the Gulf of Cort\u00e9s or the Gulf of New Spain.\n\"It was really a Spanish sea throughout the 1500s and the 1600s,\" Sledge said. The Spanish were followed by the French, who founded Mobile and New Orleans in the early 1700s. The British gained control of the eastern edge of the region in the 1760s, before the United States finally seized the area in the 1810s.\nThe massive ship-shaped museum, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, is set on a commanding waterfront location in downtown Mobile's Cooper Riverside Park, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mobile's port and bay, which feeds directly into the Gulf. Interactive displays highlight the area's multi-layered history, as well as its global influence. Visitors learn how the first European settlement in the US wasn't in St Augustine, Florida, as is commonly thought, but some 450 miles west on the Gulf in Pensacola. Exhibits also show how the Gulf's waters have become one of the world's most productive fisheries and one of the US's largest oil-producing regions. In addition, the Gulf Stream, which originates here, influences transatlantic shipping routes and moderates the weather in Western Europe by bringing warm tropical waters north.\nOther popular exhibits include a simulator that lets guests practice piloting ships, models of famous shipwrecks, a multi-storey screen tracking European voyages and towers of shipping containers, which hold exhibits. The city of Mobile, museum curators like to say, changed the world when a local company helped launch the first containerised ships in the 1950s.\nMost people have no idea about the region's complex history, says Jack E Davis, whose 2017 book, The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea, won a Pulitzer Prize. \"They associate it with oil spills and hurricanes.\"\nIn recent weeks, Davis says friends have teased him that his 592-page book might have inspired Trump's executive order to rename the body of water. But Davis says he's not happy with the US's official new name for the Gulf, and when he saw the phrase \"Gulf of America\" used last month in an official pronouncement from Florida's governor, he had a physical response. \"I almost puked, it was just awful. It's so wrong.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only town in the US built for Chinese people\n\u2022 The first free Black town in the US\n\u2022 The first king to travel around the world\nGiven that the Gulf has been central to many cultures over the centuries, Davis claims the new name is just too confining. \"It's not just us,\" he said. \"[The name Gulf of Mexico] takes my mind beyond what we call America, beyond the US to other people to other places.\"\nDavis, who grew up along the Gulf Coast, urges travellers to get to know its museums, historic homes and natural scenery. One of his favourite spots is Padre Island National Seashore in Texas. \"If you go to Padre Island and you don't feel emotionally moved, check your pulse, because it's just really this otherworldly place.\"\nAccording to Davis, the Gulf's first residents arrived 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Early European visitors were astonished when they encountered the Calusa people who thrived along what is now south-west Florida. The tribe harvested the Gulf's abundant seafood, and piled up mounds of oyster shells that stretched for miles. Tribe members were so well-nourished they towered over the Europeans.\nThe next several hundred years saw Spain, France and England competing for influence, said Deanne Stephens,a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi and executive director of the Gulf South Historical Association. \"It was quite an amalgamation of players in the region.\"\u00a0\nSince the 19th Century, the Gulf has attracted immigrants from around the world, ranging from fruit-selling Sicilians in New Orleans to Greek sponge divers in Florida. Along Stephens' Mississippi coast, the seafood industry has attracted workers from places as varied as Poland, Croatia, Vietnam and now Latin America. \"Regardless of who was here, it was always recognised by people as a place of opportunity,\" she said.\u00a0\nLikewise, Poth says her museum consistently surprises visitors. \"They had no idea how important the Gulf of Mexico is to the world.\"\nShe's excited about plans for a new exhibit devoted to another Gulf global influencer: the late singer and Mobile city native Jimmy Buffett, whose hits like Margaritaville introduced many around the world to the coast's laid-back lifestyle. Yet, she admits that the project may bring up a host of issues. \"What are we going to call it? Every one of his songs is about the Gulf of Mexico.\"\nSledge, meanwhile, says if Trump wants to change the Gulf's name, a better choice might be to call it the Gulf of the Americas, which would acknowledge its geographic breadth and its enormous challenges. Scientists say the zone faces many threats in the coming century from pollution, coastal erosion and climate change.\n\"It's a shared resource,\" he said. \"We all depend on it, and it's in our interest to take care of it \u2013 whatever we call it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

The name Gulf of Mexico, for example, first appeared on Spanish maps in the mid-1500s as a way of honouring the Mexica people who founded the Aztec empire. Yet, the 218,000-sq-mile oceanic basin \u2013 which borders five US states and a longer stretch of shoreline along the eastern coast of Mexico, along with the north-west coast of Cuba \u2013 has had other names too.\nAccording to John Sledge, the museum's maritime historian in residence, when the Spanish first reached the Gulf in 1513, they thought they had found a route to Asia and initially called it the Chinese Sea (a name unlikely to appeal to Trump, Sledge noted). Other early explorers called it the Gulf of Cort\u00e9s or the Gulf of New Spain.\n\"It was really a Spanish sea throughout the 1500s and the 1600s,\" Sledge said. The Spanish were followed by the French, who founded Mobile and New Orleans in the early 1700s. The British gained control of the eastern edge of the region in the 1760s, before the United States finally seized the area in the 1810s.\nThe massive ship-shaped museum, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, is set on a commanding waterfront location in downtown Mobile's Cooper Riverside Park, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mobile's port and bay, which feeds directly into the Gulf. Interactive displays highlight the area's multi-layered history, as well as its global influence. Visitors learn how the first European settlement in the US wasn't in St Augustine, Florida, as is commonly thought, but some 450 miles west on the Gulf in Pensacola. Exhibits also show how the Gulf's waters have become one of the world's most productive fisheries and one of the US's largest oil-producing regions. In addition, the Gulf Stream, which originates here, influences transatlantic shipping routes and moderates the weather in Western Europe by bringing warm tropical waters north.\nOther popular exhibits include a simulator that lets guests practice piloting ships, models of famous shipwrecks, a multi-storey screen tracking European voyages and towers of shipping containers, which hold exhibits.

But Davis says he's not happy with the US's official new name for the Gulf, and when he saw the phrase \"Gulf of America\" used last month in an official pronouncement from Florida's governor, he had a physical response. \"I almost puked, it was just awful. It's so wrong.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only town in the US built for Chinese people\n\u2022 The first free Black town in the US\n\u2022 The first king to travel around the world\nGiven that the Gulf has been central to many cultures over the centuries, Davis claims the new name is just too confining. \"It's not just us,\" he said. \"[The name Gulf of Mexico] takes my mind beyond what we call America, beyond the US to other people to other places.\"\nDavis, who grew up along the Gulf Coast, urges travellers to get to know its museums, historic homes and natural scenery. One of his favourite spots is Padre Island National Seashore in Texas. \"If you go to Padre Island and you don't feel emotionally moved, check your pulse, because it's just really this otherworldly place.\"\nAccording to Davis, the Gulf's first residents arrived 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Early European visitors were astonished when they encountered the Calusa people who thrived along what is now south-west Florida. The tribe harvested the Gulf's abundant seafood, and piled up mounds of oyster shells that stretched for miles. Tribe members were so well-nourished they towered over the Europeans.\nThe next several hundred years saw Spain, France and England competing for influence, said Deanne Stephens,a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi and executive director of the Gulf South Historical Association. \"It was quite an amalgamation of players in the region.\"\u00a0\nSince the 19th Century, the Gulf has attracted immigrants from around the world, ranging from fruit-selling Sicilians in New Orleans to Greek sponge divers in Florida. Along Stephens' Mississippi coast, the seafood industry has attracted workers from places as varied as Poland, Croatia, Vietnam and now Latin America. \"Regardless of who was here, it was always recognised by people as a place of opportunity,\" she said.\u00a0\nLikewise, Poth says her museum consistently surprises visitors. \"They had no idea how important the Gulf of Mexico is to the world.\"\nShe's excited about plans for a new exhibit devoted to another Gulf global influencer: the late singer and Mobile city native Jimmy Buffett, whose hits like Margaritaville introduced many around the world to the coast's laid-back lifestyle.

        "article_text": "Dutch linguist Leonie Cornips has become fascinated with how cows communicate. But can this really be called 'language'?\nLeonie Cornips was long overdue for her coffee break. The chilly autumn air made a hot drink feel enticing. But Cornips was busy. She was a couple of hours into her work with a small herd of dairy cows. If she left now, she would lose something that would take time to recover. Cornips and the herd had entered a delicate, shared space she calls \"the rhythm of the cow\".\u00a0\nCornips is a sociolinguist at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scholars who pass through the institute's ornate doorway usually specialise in the study of Dutch language and culture. The soft-spoken researcher earned her academic laurels in the 1990s, and she still studies variations in syntax between different dialects in the Netherlands. But in addition to this, Cornips' work has more recently taken what professionals in the field call \"the animal turn\".\nFor years, Cornips has spent her summer holidays on a farm. She was struck from the start by the different personalities of individual cows. She read an essay by a philosopher that asked why linguists never study animals. It affected her deeply. Cornips felt that cows had the intelligence and social habits to be good research subjects for a linguist. As a Dutch person, she also knew they were cultural icons in a nation with a passion for cheese. So she turned her professional skills to cows.\nHumans have assumed for centuries that the ability to use language is a measure of our superiority. There is even an academic term for it: \"logocentrism\", meaning those who use words (from the Greek logos, meaning \"word\" or \"reason\") occupy a privileged position. Language, say many linguists, is what makes us human. Animals may grunt, bark or chirp, but they do not possess anything that counts as language.\nCornips is using her work with dairy cows to push back on this idea. It extends half a century of effort that began with Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees and Roger Payne's recording of humpback whales in the 1960s in an effort to show that humans may not be as linguistically unique as we had assumed.\nMany of Cornips' colleagues were sceptical when she suggested they apply the framework of linguistics to animals.\n\"The problem is people have no clear idea about language,\" she says. \"When they talk about language, they always refer to what comes out of the mouth.\" But after spending six years thoroughly immersed in the lives of cows, Cornips thinks that language is better understood as \"distributed\" between the mouth, body and surroundings, making it embodied, multi-modal and sensory. \"I'm eating with the cows, touching, kissing, walking, hugging,\" she says.\nMost research on cow language tend to focus on sounds. A 2015 study in the Netherlands, for example, looked at the pitch of cow sounds to see if they correlated with behaviours and concluded this could be a way to determine their welfare. And a 2019 Australian study found cows not only have distinctive individual vocalisations, but maintain these distinctive calls across a variety of contexts.\nCornips and the farmers she recruits to assist her record the frequency, duration and intensity of the sounds cows make. But she also focusses on the other ways meaning is expressed among bovines. Her methods are often ethnographic, a way of studying cultures that relies strongly on observation by the researcher. Cornips carefully observes cow behaviours and interactions alongside sound to determine how they communicate. \"I notice with cows that the body is an instrument to get to know the other,\" she says. Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".\nCows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says. This became obvious with Piet, a young male Fleckvieh from an intensively managed indoor facility who Cornips brought to join five other cows in an outdoor pasture.\u00a0\n\"I was always so happy to see him, that when I got into his meadow, I walked straight towards him and tried to touch him immediately,\" Cornips says. When she did so, Piet would back away.\nCornips gradually came to understand the need to respect Piet's personal space, as she might with a fellow human. She learned to keep her arms by her sides and only use eye contact intermittently, taking turns with Piet to look at each other and then look away. \"It took me quite a while,\" she says. \"I was very stupid. They are teaching me how to connect to them.\" Cornips realised she had to learn an etiquette. Without patience and attention, she says, you would never see it.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The scientists learning to speak whale\n\u2022\u00a0The sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet' revealed by AI\n\u2022\u00a0Is there something special about the human voice?\nPatience also turns out to be crucial when cows communicate with each other. When a mother calls her calf, it sometimes takes 60 seconds for the calf to respond. The space between is filled with bodily gestures. Studies from Austria show that ear positioning and neck-stretching are integral to cow language. Humans think of the ability to wiggle our ears as a party trick. For a cow, it appears to be fundamental to communication. The first sentence in a conversation with a cow is likely to involve movement of the ears and a look.\u00a0\u00a0\nCows are not the only animals being studied for their complex modes of communication. Michelle Fournet, an assistant professor specialising in marine acoustic ecology at the University of New Hampshire in the US, has learned it is unhelpful to impose human expectations on species like whales and seals.\nAnimals use sound completely differently from how humans use it, she says. \"If we are to do a good job at understanding how animals are communicating and why they are communicating, it behoves us to adopt their perspective.\"\nFournet stops short of using the word \"language\" to describe the information transfer taking place between non-humans. But she has gained a deep appreciation for the subtleties of animal communication. Their system is not less than ours, Fournet says, but other. We do them a disservice by searching for similarities.\u00a0\nOne difference between humans and many animals is their use of the environment. Cornips has found cow communication leans on its surroundings more than ours. She observed one herd where individuals used their bodies to bang on an iron fence to communicate with the rest of the herd at feeding time, which she views as a type of language. She noticed cows responding to her differently depending on whether she entered a barn with solid walls or open sides: since cows on different farms are surrounded by different physical features, this offers distinctive opportunities for linguistic expression. Cows, she argues, develop diverse languaging practices \u2013 almost like dialects \u2013 where meaning depends on the shape of their surroundings.\nLike other domestic animals, cows face the additional challenge of interspecies communication with humans. \"Most farmers are not sensitive to the rhythm of the cow,\" says Cornips. \"The cows must obey the rhythm of the farmer.\" Dairy herds are constantly shunted between feeding, milking and grazing grounds. If a cow does not learn the daily routine or fails to be productive, it goes to the slaughterhouse. She is shocked by how readily people assume cows are stupid.\u00a0\n\"In becoming a dairy cow,\" she says, \"they must have very rich communicative skills because they have to understand what the farmer wants them to do\u2026 which is not easy.\"\nCornips has analysed recordings to show that cows will simplify their vocalisation once a farmer recognises their need. Rather than having their intelligence bred out of them to be more compliant, Cornips thinks domestic animals are forced to develop a fuller communication repertoire than wild animals.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf dairy cows have complex linguistic practices, it's tempting to ask how they stack up against the other great communicators in the animal kingdom. How would they compare, for example, to humpback whales? Cornips admires the complex vocalisations found in whale song. Humpbacks are among the cetaceans known to develop different dialects in different regions. They also communicate over vast distances. (Read more about the sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language which researchers are uncovering in whale communication).\nBut Cornips points out that whales lack some of the capacities of cows. A whale's ears are not as moveable as a cow's, she says. They also lack hooves. \"Whales cannot express themselves bodily very much,\" Cornips says. \"In that way they may be [less complex] than cows.\"\nFournet says she does not believe it makes sense to rank animal communication by its complexity. \"There isn't an answer to what you are looking for,\" she told me when I asked her to compare whales to cows.\nMany traditional linguists are still hesitant to ascribe language to non-humans. Leora Bar-el, a linguistics professor at the University of Montana in the US, is not hostile to the idea of animal language but thinks it worth asking what we gain and what we lose by expanding the definition of language to include cows.\n\"We may lose the fact there is something unique about human language,\" she says. For example, human language permits incredible creativity. Think of the works of Shakespeare. It can also refer to distant events and even reflect back on itself, as language does when it provides a definition.\nBut Eva Meijer, author of the essay that first inspired Cornips and the 2018 book Animal Languages, argues such claims can be self-fulfilling. \"What we see as language has been developed by excluding the language of other animals,\" she says. In fact, we define language in a way that makes it easy to deny it to others. Meijer points out the long history of human oppression associated with denying other people their language. She believes that recognising language in animals provides new tools for understanding them and perhaps even for learning how to inhabit the planet more sustainably.\nCornips, though, does not put an animal rights agenda at the centre of her work. She is focused primarily on expanding the field of linguistics. But the implications are hard to ignore. Cows may have more complex social lives than we thought. Her research reveals numerous additional avenues for exploration. How much does language contribute to distinctive bovine communities and cultures? What sort of planning can cows do with each other? Can they use language to pass on knowledge between generations?\nThe answers to these questions could change how we regard the lives of many animals. When 96% of the weight of mammals on earth is made up of humans and domesticated livestock, understanding better what cattle, sheep and chickens are communicating could lead to improved relationships with them, as well as better lives for animals.\u00a0\nCornips knows things are unlikely to change fast. Recently, though, she has noticed the idea that animals have language has become more common in academic journals.\nShe hopes linguistics can be a tool for unlocking different attitudes. \"My most important goal,\" she says, \"is to show others that you can look with different eyes at a domestic animal.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Dutch linguist Leonie Cornips has become fascinated with how cows communicate. But can this really be called 'language'?\nLeonie Cornips was long overdue for her coffee break. The chilly autumn air made a hot drink feel enticing. But Cornips was busy. She was a couple of hours into her work with a small herd of dairy cows. If she left now, she would lose something that would take time to recover. Cornips and the herd had entered a delicate, shared space she calls \"the rhythm of the cow\".\u00a0\nCornips is a sociolinguist at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scholars who pass through the institute's ornate doorway usually specialise in the study of Dutch language and culture. The soft-spoken researcher earned her academic laurels in the 1990s, and she still studies variations in syntax between different dialects in the Netherlands. But in addition to this, Cornips' work has more recently taken what professionals in the field call \"the animal turn\".\nFor years, Cornips has spent her summer holidays on a farm. She was struck from the start by the different personalities of individual cows. She read an essay by a philosopher that asked why linguists never study animals. It affected her deeply. Cornips felt that cows had the intelligence and social habits to be good research subjects for a linguist. As a Dutch person, she also knew they were cultural icons in a nation with a passion for cheese. So she turned her professional skills to cows.\nHumans have assumed for centuries that the ability to use language is a measure of our superiority. There is even an academic term for it: \"logocentrism\", meaning those who use words (from the Greek logos, meaning \"word\" or \"reason\") occupy a privileged position. Language, say many linguists, is what makes us human. Animals may grunt, bark or chirp, but they do not possess anything that counts as language.\nCornips is using her work with dairy cows to push back on this idea. It extends half a century of effort that began with Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees and Roger Payne's recording of humpback whales in the 1960s in an effort to show that humans may not be as linguistically unique as we had assumed.\nMany of Cornips' colleagues were sceptical when she suggested they apply the framework of linguistics to animals.\n\"The problem is people have no clear idea about language,\" she says. \"When they talk about language, they always refer to what comes out of the mouth.\" But after spending six years thoroughly immersed in the lives of cows, Cornips thinks that language is better understood as \"distributed\" between the mouth, body and surroundings, making it embodied, multi-modal and sensory. \"I'm eating with the cows, touching, kissing, walking, hugging,\" she says.\nMost research on cow language tend to focus on sounds. A 2015 study in the Netherlands, for example, looked at the pitch of cow sounds to see if they correlated with behaviours and concluded this could be a way to determine their welfare. And a 2019 Australian study found cows not only have distinctive individual vocalisations, but maintain these distinctive calls across a variety of contexts.\nCornips and the farmers she recruits to assist her record the frequency, duration and intensity of the sounds cows make. But she also focusses on the other ways meaning is expressed among bovines. Her methods are often ethnographic, a way of studying cultures that relies strongly on observation by the researcher. Cornips carefully observes cow behaviours and interactions alongside sound to determine how they communicate. \"I notice with cows that the body is an instrument to get to know the other,\" she says. Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".\nCows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says. This became obvious with Piet, a young male Fleckvieh from an intensively managed indoor facility who Cornips brought to join five other cows in an outdoor pasture.\u00a0\n\"I was always so happy to see him, that when I got into his meadow, I walked straight towards him and tried to touch him immediately,\" Cornips says. When she did so, Piet would back away.\nCornips gradually came to understand the need to respect Piet's personal space, as she might with a fellow human. She learned to keep her arms by her sides and only use eye contact intermittently, taking turns with Piet to look at each other and then look away. \"It took me quite a while,\" she says. \"I was very stupid. They are teaching me how to connect to them.\" Cornips realised she had to learn an etiquette. Without patience and attention, she says, you would never see it.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The scientists learning to speak whale\n\u2022\u00a0The sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet' revealed by AI\n\u2022\u00a0Is there something special about the human voice?\nPatience also turns out to be crucial when cows communicate with each other.

We're trying to pin those down.\"\nJanuary 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.\nEarly last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.\nThis year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.\nWhile La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.\n\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.\n\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"\nA number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.\nOne idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.\nWhile it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.\nThe El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.\nBut it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.\n\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.\nThe fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.\n\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"\nAnother prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.\nThese tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.\nAerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.\nBut it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.\nAnd this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.\nMost scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.\nThe \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.\nThis theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.\nCurrently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.\nWhat they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.\n\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.\n\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"\nGraphics by Erwan Rivault\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "Swimming holidays are the ultimate in slow travel \u2013 and since the pandemic, they've become more popular than ever.\nThe pale-blue copper domes of the church of Our Lady of the Rock were easy to spot as we swam across the Bay of Kotor from the picturesque fishing village of Dra\u017ein Vrt. So too were shoals of Adriatic fish: sardines, mackerel and sprats, as well as sea anemones and urchins. The water was crystal clear and almost Caribbean blue; and when my head was not in the water, the landscape was panoramic mountains.\u00a0\nThis delightful experience was the first day of a swimming holiday in and around the Montenegro fjords. It was not a vacation that involved lying on a beach and taking the occasional dip in the sea, but one where we travelled by swimming in a group while a boat transported our gear from place to place. A swimming holiday is the ultimate in slow travel, moving through the water from island to island and cove to cove, stopping for lunch in a historic town or tiny fishing village before returning to the sea to meander further around the coastline.\u00a0\nFor a while, it seemed that no matter how far we swam, the church sitting in the middle of the bay on a rocky promontory was not getting any closer. The swim itself was rewarding, through clear, warm waters surrounded by jagged mountains, but the goal was the islet where, according to legend, local seamen found an icon of the Madonna and Child on a rock.

        "article_text": "Abraham Lincoln's wife was long attacked for everything from her spending to her lack of emotional restraint. But with two new plays about her, she is finally getting better press.\nDuring last month's US presidential inauguration, as ever during these quadrennial celebrations, fierce interest focused on the First Lady. Much was made of Melania Trump's dresses, her enigmatic smiles, and especially the navy-blue wide-brimmed boater-style hat \u00a0she wore for the swearing-in. Was the hat a deliberate choice, to shield her face from the prying eyes of the public? No one could say, but legions speculated.\nHow unenviable is the lot of the President's wife, lacking in formal power but constantly judged \u2013 expected to be immaculately turned out, and to remain, in conduct, ever above reproach. The court of public opinion has found no First Lady more wanting than Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of Abraham Lincoln. Her husband, who emancipated the slaves, and saved the union, enjoys near-universal adulation, while Mrs Lincoln has been the subject of criticism and disapproval since her first days in Washington in 1861 when she embarked on plans for a lavish redecoration of the White House. She travelled to New York for a shopping spree, and reporters followed her everywhere. One for The New York Herald wrote: \"Mrs Lincoln, who has been engaged since her arrival in making large purchases at some of the leading merchants, was out yesterday enjoying herself in the usual way.\" \u00a0\nSuch reports did not go down well in the besieged, wartime capital. Indeed, the loyalty of the First Lady, who hailed from a slave-holding family, and had three half-brothers in the Confederate Army, was questioned throughout the Civil War. Even after her husband was shot on 14 April 1865 by Confederate supporter John Wilkes Booth, as he sat beside her in Ford's Theater, the public didn\u2019t embrace their hero's widow. In 1875, her own son had her committed to an insane asylum.\u00a0\nAnd yet today, in the era of TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook, where social esteem rises and falls capriciously on clicks and likes, the maligned Mary Todd Lincoln is getting some compassionate reassessment on the stage, most particularly in Mrs President, a new play by US historian, writer and artist John Ransom Phillips opening this week at London's Charing Cross Theatre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis two-hander centres on the relationship between Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Miriam Grace Edwards), and Mathew Brady, considered the father of American photo-journalism (Sam Jenkins-Shaw) who took iconic pictures of Abraham Lincoln, his family, and the battlefields of the bloody US Civil War. The new play imagines the First Lady, coming to Brady\u2019s studio to sit for her portrait, aware that she is an object of suspicion because of her southern heritage, and seeking an \"image that will define history\u2019s view of me\". Brady declares he has the power to do that. \"I shape the image of people who shape America. Past. Present. Future,\" he says. \u00a0\nIn Ransom Phillips' depiction, Mrs Lincoln demands to be addressed as Mrs President, and engages in an on-going verbal tug of war with Brady over how she should be portrayed. The play asks who controls the revelatory public image, the subject or the artist? This question transcends time and place, but has specific resonance for the former First Lady who sought, and believed she never received, proper recognition during her life for all she had done, and suffered. Later scenes follow Mrs Lincoln into her widowhood, and other controversial historical figures of mid-19th-Century America \u2013 abolitionist John Brown, Chief Justice Roger Taney, and naturalist John James Audubon \u2013 appear on stage, depicted by Jenkins-Shaw. Mrs President is a daringly kaleidoscopic look at the ownership of self.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn truth, Mary Todd Lincoln and Mathew Brady's relationship was a limited one. She did pose for Brady at his studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in November of 1861. When she saw the photographs, she was unhappy with how she looked and instructed that they all be destroyed, except for one she deemed \"passable\", in which she stands, and her face is seen in profile; Brady ignored this request and kept all the photographs in his archives. And later in Lincoln's term, she returned to the studio a few times, but it's not known if Brady took any other of her portraits, as he deputised much studio work to his assistants.\u00a0\nRansom Philips tells the BBC his aim with the play wasn't to document history but rather \"to rescue Mary Todd Lincoln from ridicule and caricature, and to show her as fully a person, a woman of complexity and depth of feeling \u2013\u00a0possessing the kind of emotionality that men often lack\". And his view of Brady is not totally benign. \"Brady is an artist, like I am, and I know artists can be tyrannous.\"\nIn a wildly different way, another theatre production currently running in New York is also sympathetic to the 16th First Lady. Oh, Mary! has been a huge word-of-mouth hit since it first premiered at the city's\u00a0Lucille Lortel Theatre in February 2024, before transferring to Broadway in the summer. This comedy, written by Cole Escola and described by The New York Times as \"gleefully tasteless\" and an \"unhinged historical fantasia\", depicts Mary as a lascivious, self-centered alcoholic who yearns to escape the White House and her nasty, neglectful husband so as to become a cabaret star. Until Escola turned over the role to Betty Gilpin last month, they themselves starred as Mary \u2013 in drag, shaking a mop-like wig of black barrel curls. All joking aside, and Oh, Mary! has numerous slapstick moments, the play's inspiration was Escola\u2019s own sense of identification with Mary \u2013 a woman who could be \"too much\" and was \"trapped in this role she was wrong for\", as Escola explained in an interview on NPR last year.\u00a0\nPerhaps unintentionally, Escola and Phillips have joined a century-long debate among historians over how Mary Lincoln should best be understood. Was she an energetic, ambitious young woman who recognised genius in Lincoln, a rough-hewn country lawyer, and propelled him to greatness? Or was she a volatile wife who made Lincoln's domestic life a living hell, hurling accusations \u00ad\u2013 and on occasion crockery \u2013 at him during regular fits of rage? Was she first unhinged by grief in 1850, when she lost her son Eddie at age three to tuberculosis? Or was it the loss of a second son, Willy, 12 years later, that really drove her mental health decline? Did she take bribes and pad expense accounts as First Lady? Or did she act as a valuable helpmeet, giving President Lincoln sage advice?\n\"In the public imagination she's multiple people \u2013 it all depends on who is examining her,\" historian Jason Emerson tells the BBC. Author of seven books on the Lincoln family, including The Madness of Mary Lincoln, Emerson is currently assembling a complete volume of the former First Lady's letters for the Lincoln Studies Center of the University of Illinois. \"Mary was a complex person, very human, and she made mistakes, as Lincoln did too. She is essentially a tragic figure.\"\nLoss haunted Mary's life starting at the age of six, when her mother died. After Mary's father remarried and sired nine children with his new wife, love was a scant commodity in the family home in Lexington, Kentucky. Mary escaped to Springfield, Illinois, where she lived with her elder sister. Vivacious in conversation and praised, too, for her pretty face and milky complexion, young Mary had many admirers. She found in Lincoln a man who shared her passion for poetry, theatre and Whig politics, and who was also nearly 10 years older and more than a foot taller. But rather than provide her with the steady paternal affection she missed out on as a child, Lincoln was often away from home, working as a lawyer on the Illinois judicial circuit. As introverted as his wife was extroverted, Lincoln struggled to respond to her emotional pleas for attention and sympathy.\n\"Temperamentally they were very different,\" Emerson says. \"And as she aged, her mental problems got worse, consistent with bi-polar issues.\" Emerson's study of Mary Lincoln and her extended family has convinced him that she suffered from the condition formerly known as manic depressive disorder, not widely diagnosed in the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe stresses on both Lincolns during their time in wartime Washington were immense, and Mary was determined to dress fashionably and entertain lavishly. \"She thought of herself as the Queen of America, doing what she was supposed to do as First Lady\" says Emerson. \"Her narcissism was perhaps her greatest vulnerability.\" But when their son Willie succumbed to typhoid in 1862, she refused to get out of bed for weeks and grieved so copiously her husband rebuked her.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What do these First Lady portraits reveal?\n\u2022 The Abraham Lincoln portrait that was a fake\n\u2022 The 17th-Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait\nPerhaps it was inevitable that this often unrestrained woman, would continue to get bad press after her death in 1882. William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, reinforced the most unflattering views of Mary Lincoln, in the biography he co-wrote in 1889 titled Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life. Herndon and Mary despised each other during Lincoln's lifetime and competed for his attention. In private Herndon called her a \"she-wolf\".\nFor many decades, Herndon's interpretation stood \u2013 Mary Todd Lincoln was regarded as a harridan married to a saint. But in the 1980s and 1990s, when scholars began to seriously reassess the role of women in history, the troubled First Lady got a fresh look. In 1987, Jean Baker, a historian at Maryland's Goucher College published Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, portraying the Lincoln marriage as fundamentally tolerant and loving, and Mary as a vital, behind-the-scenes participant in her husband's political career, consoling, advising and encouraging.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat view in turn, was contradicted by renowned Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame in his 2021 book An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. Burlingame believes Lincoln was made miserable by his wife, who, he believes, at times physically abused him, and posits she seduced Lincoln to force him to marry her \u2013 they were wed on a day's notice, their first child born a scant nine months later. And Burlingame is certain, based on evidence in US government archives, that she solicited bribes and sold permits and pardons while in the White House. Yet, the author credits Mary with fuelling Lincoln\u2019s rise. \"If he hadn't married a woman who was so ambitious and so willing to prod her husband and to goad him... he may not have gone as far as he did,\" the historian said in a recent interview for the History Unplugged podcast. Moreover, Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with difficult people, a gift constantly on display during his Presidency, had been honed by plenty of practice at home, in Burlingame's view.\nAuthor, too, of the definitive Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (2009) Burlingame was among numerous experts consulted by director Steven Spielberg for his 2012 hit film, Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the president and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The film portrays the First Lady in a generally positive light, and husband and wife as closely bonded. And yet Burlingame realised that Spielberg and scriptwriter Tony Kushner had closely studied his biography \u2013 which included his hypothesis about the hasty Lincoln wedding \u2013 when Day-Lewis (as Lincoln) and Field (as Mary Lincoln) argue over their eldest son Robert joining the army. He's in favour, she's opposed, and Mary accuses her husband of never liking the boy. \"You've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief,\" she says. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast.\nBut even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. And it's one of the pleasures of the play Mrs President to see the heroine put up a fight for her own identity, and ignore the often harsh and deprecating judgements rained down upon her both before and after her death.\nMrs President is at Charing Cross Theatre, London until March 16. Oh Mary! is booking at the Lyceum Theatre, New York until 28 June.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

As introverted as his wife was extroverted, Lincoln struggled to respond to her emotional pleas for attention and sympathy.\n\"Temperamentally they were very different,\" Emerson says. \"And as she aged, her mental problems got worse, consistent with bi-polar issues.\" Emerson's study of Mary Lincoln and her extended family has convinced him that she suffered from the condition formerly known as manic depressive disorder, not widely diagnosed in the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe stresses on both Lincolns during their time in wartime Washington were immense, and Mary was determined to dress fashionably and entertain lavishly. \"She thought of herself as the Queen of America, doing what she was supposed to do as First Lady\" says Emerson. \"Her narcissism was perhaps her greatest vulnerability.\" But when their son Willie succumbed to typhoid in 1862, she refused to get out of bed for weeks and grieved so copiously her husband rebuked her.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What do these First Lady portraits reveal?\n\u2022 The Abraham Lincoln portrait that was a fake\n\u2022 The 17th-Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait\nPerhaps it was inevitable that this often unrestrained woman, would continue to get bad press after her death in 1882. William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, reinforced the most unflattering views of Mary Lincoln, in the biography he co-wrote in 1889 titled Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life. Herndon and Mary despised each other during Lincoln's lifetime and competed for his attention. In private Herndon called her a \"she-wolf\".\nFor many decades, Herndon's interpretation stood \u2013 Mary Todd Lincoln was regarded as a harridan married to a saint. But in the 1980s and 1990s, when scholars began to seriously reassess the role of women in history, the troubled First Lady got a fresh look. In 1987, Jean Baker, a historian at Maryland's Goucher College published Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, portraying the Lincoln marriage as fundamentally tolerant and loving, and Mary as a vital, behind-the-scenes participant in her husband's political career, consoling, advising and encouraging.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat view in turn, was contradicted by renowned Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame in his 2021 book An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. Burlingame believes Lincoln was made miserable by his wife, who, he believes, at times physically abused him, and posits she seduced Lincoln to force him to marry her \u2013 they were wed on a day's notice, their first child born a scant nine months later. And Burlingame is certain, based on evidence in US government archives, that she solicited bribes and sold permits and pardons while in the White House. Yet, the author credits Mary with fuelling Lincoln\u2019s rise. \"If he hadn't married a woman who was so ambitious and so willing to prod her husband and to goad him... he may not have gone as far as he did,\" the historian said in a recent interview for the History Unplugged podcast. Moreover, Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with difficult people, a gift constantly on display during his Presidency, had been honed by plenty of practice at home, in Burlingame's view.\nAuthor, too, of the definitive Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (2009) Burlingame was among numerous experts consulted by director Steven Spielberg for his 2012 hit film, Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the president and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The film portrays the First Lady in a generally positive light, and husband and wife as closely bonded. And yet Burlingame realised that Spielberg and scriptwriter Tony Kushner had closely studied his biography \u2013 which included his hypothesis about the hasty Lincoln wedding \u2013 when Day-Lewis (as Lincoln) and Field (as Mary Lincoln) argue over their eldest son Robert joining the army. He's in favour, she's opposed, and Mary accuses her husband of never liking the boy. \"You've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief,\" she says. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast.\nBut even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. And it's one of the pleasures of the play Mrs President to see the heroine put up a fight for her own identity, and ignore the often harsh and deprecating judgements rained down upon her both before and after her death.\nMrs President is at Charing Cross Theatre, London until March 16.

        "article_text": "Abraham Lincoln's wife was long attacked for everything from her spending to her lack of emotional restraint. But with two new plays about her, she is finally getting better press.\nDuring last month's US presidential inauguration, as ever during these quadrennial celebrations, fierce interest focused on the First Lady. Much was made of Melania Trump's dresses, her enigmatic smiles, and especially the navy-blue wide-brimmed boater-style hat \u00a0she wore for the swearing-in. Was the hat a deliberate choice, to shield her face from the prying eyes of the public? No one could say, but legions speculated.\nHow unenviable is the lot of the President's wife, lacking in formal power but constantly judged \u2013 expected to be immaculately turned out, and to remain, in conduct, ever above reproach. The court of public opinion has found no First Lady more wanting than Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of Abraham Lincoln. Her husband, who emancipated the slaves, and saved the union, enjoys near-universal adulation, while Mrs Lincoln has been the subject of criticism and disapproval since her first days in Washington in 1861 when she embarked on plans for a lavish redecoration of the White House. She travelled to New York for a shopping spree, and reporters followed her everywhere. One for The New York Herald wrote: \"Mrs Lincoln, who has been engaged since her arrival in making large purchases at some of the leading merchants, was out yesterday enjoying herself in the usual way.\" \u00a0\nSuch reports did not go down well in the besieged, wartime capital. Indeed, the loyalty of the First Lady, who hailed from a slave-holding family, and had three half-brothers in the Confederate Army, was questioned throughout the Civil War. Even after her husband was shot on 14 April 1865 by Confederate supporter John Wilkes Booth, as he sat beside her in Ford's Theater, the public didn\u2019t embrace their hero's widow. In 1875, her own son had her committed to an insane asylum.\u00a0\nAnd yet today, in the era of TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook, where social esteem rises and falls capriciously on clicks and likes, the maligned Mary Todd Lincoln is getting some compassionate reassessment on the stage, most particularly in Mrs President, a new play by US historian, writer and artist John Ransom Phillips opening this week at London's Charing Cross Theatre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis two-hander centres on the relationship between Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Miriam Grace Edwards), and Mathew Brady, considered the father of American photo-journalism (Sam Jenkins-Shaw) who took iconic pictures of Abraham Lincoln, his family, and the battlefields of the bloody US Civil War. The new play imagines the First Lady, coming to Brady\u2019s studio to sit for her portrait, aware that she is an object of suspicion because of her southern heritage, and seeking an \"image that will define history\u2019s view of me\". Brady declares he has the power to do that. \"I shape the image of people who shape America. Past. Present. Future,\" he says. \u00a0\nIn Ransom Phillips' depiction, Mrs Lincoln demands to be addressed as Mrs President, and engages in an on-going verbal tug of war with Brady over how she should be portrayed. The play asks who controls the revelatory public image, the subject or the artist? This question transcends time and place, but has specific resonance for the former First Lady who sought, and believed she never received, proper recognition during her life for all she had done, and suffered. Later scenes follow Mrs Lincoln into her widowhood, and other controversial historical figures of mid-19th-Century America \u2013 abolitionist John Brown, Chief Justice Roger Taney, and naturalist John James Audubon \u2013 appear on stage, depicted by Jenkins-Shaw. Mrs President is a daringly kaleidoscopic look at the ownership of self.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn truth, Mary Todd Lincoln and Mathew Brady's relationship was a limited one. She did pose for Brady at his studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in November of 1861. When she saw the photographs, she was unhappy with how she looked and instructed that they all be destroyed, except for one she deemed \"passable\", in which she stands, and her face is seen in profile; Brady ignored this request and kept all the photographs in his archives. And later in Lincoln's term, she returned to the studio a few times, but it's not known if Brady took any other of her portraits, as he deputised much studio work to his assistants.\u00a0\nRansom Philips tells the BBC his aim with the play wasn't to document history but rather \"to rescue Mary Todd Lincoln from ridicule and caricature, and to show her as fully a person, a woman of complexity and depth of feeling \u2013\u00a0possessing the kind of emotionality that men often lack\". And his view of Brady is not totally benign. \"Brady is an artist, like I am, and I know artists can be tyrannous.\"\nIn a wildly different way, another theatre production currently running in New York is also sympathetic to the 16th First Lady. Oh, Mary! has been a huge word-of-mouth hit since it first premiered at the city's\u00a0Lucille Lortel Theatre in February 2024, before transferring to Broadway in the summer. This comedy, written by Cole Escola and described by The New York Times as \"gleefully tasteless\" and an \"unhinged historical fantasia\", depicts Mary as a lascivious, self-centered alcoholic who yearns to escape the White House and her nasty, neglectful husband so as to become a cabaret star. Until Escola turned over the role to Betty Gilpin last month, they themselves starred as Mary \u2013 in drag, shaking a mop-like wig of black barrel curls. All joking aside, and Oh, Mary! has numerous slapstick moments, the play's inspiration was Escola\u2019s own sense of identification with Mary \u2013 a woman who could be \"too much\" and was \"trapped in this role she was wrong for\", as Escola explained in an interview on NPR last year.\u00a0\nPerhaps unintentionally, Escola and Phillips have joined a century-long debate among historians over how Mary Lincoln should best be understood. Was she an energetic, ambitious young woman who recognised genius in Lincoln, a rough-hewn country lawyer, and propelled him to greatness? Or was she a volatile wife who made Lincoln's domestic life a living hell, hurling accusations \u00ad\u2013 and on occasion crockery \u2013 at him during regular fits of rage? Was she first unhinged by grief in 1850, when she lost her son Eddie at age three to tuberculosis? Or was it the loss of a second son, Willy, 12 years later, that really drove her mental health decline? Did she take bribes and pad expense accounts as First Lady? Or did she act as a valuable helpmeet, giving President Lincoln sage advice?\n\"In the public imagination she's multiple people \u2013 it all depends on who is examining her,\" historian Jason Emerson tells the BBC. Author of seven books on the Lincoln family, including The Madness of Mary Lincoln, Emerson is currently assembling a complete volume of the former First Lady's letters for the Lincoln Studies Center of the University of Illinois. \"Mary was a complex person, very human, and she made mistakes, as Lincoln did too. She is essentially a tragic figure.\"\nLoss haunted Mary's life starting at the age of six, when her mother died. After Mary's father remarried and sired nine children with his new wife, love was a scant commodity in the family home in Lexington, Kentucky.

In 1987, Jean Baker, a historian at Maryland's Goucher College published Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, portraying the Lincoln marriage as fundamentally tolerant and loving, and Mary as a vital, behind-the-scenes participant in her husband's political career, consoling, advising and encouraging.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat view in turn, was contradicted by renowned Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame in his 2021 book An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. Burlingame believes Lincoln was made miserable by his wife, who, he believes, at times physically abused him, and posits she seduced Lincoln to force him to marry her \u2013 they were wed on a day's notice, their first child born a scant nine months later. And Burlingame is certain, based on evidence in US government archives, that she solicited bribes and sold permits and pardons while in the White House. Yet, the author credits Mary with fuelling Lincoln\u2019s rise. \"If he hadn't married a woman who was so ambitious and so willing to prod her husband and to goad him... he may not have gone as far as he did,\" the historian said in a recent interview for the History Unplugged podcast. Moreover, Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with difficult people, a gift constantly on display during his Presidency, had been honed by plenty of practice at home, in Burlingame's view.\nAuthor, too, of the definitive Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (2009) Burlingame was among numerous experts consulted by director Steven Spielberg for his 2012 hit film, Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the president and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The film portrays the First Lady in a generally positive light, and husband and wife as closely bonded. And yet Burlingame realised that Spielberg and scriptwriter Tony Kushner had closely studied his biography \u2013 which included his hypothesis about the hasty Lincoln wedding \u2013 when Day-Lewis (as Lincoln) and Field (as Mary Lincoln) argue over their eldest son Robert joining the army. He's in favour, she's opposed, and Mary accuses her husband of never liking the boy. \"You've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief,\" she says. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast.\nBut even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. And it's one of the pleasures of the play Mrs President to see the heroine put up a fight for her own identity, and ignore the often harsh and deprecating judgements rained down upon her both before and after her death.\nMrs President is at Charing Cross Theatre, London until March 16. Oh Mary! is booking at the Lyceum Theatre, New York until 28 June.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "These tiny soldiers can eat four times their own weight in organic waste \u2013 and turn it into sustainable fertiliser.\nWith a unique ability to consume nearly any form of organic matter it comes across, one small but mighty insect is becoming a tool to address the growing problem of organic waste and soil degradation. The bug, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), transforms food waste into nutrient-rich biofertiliser: frass.\nInsects have been long been used in agricultural practices as a food source \u2013 but now farmers are exploring the potential of bug poo as a sustainable fertiliser. With over 33% of the world's soil currently degraded, depleted of the nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth, frass can play a major role in restoring soil biodiversity and quality.\u00a0\nIn May 2024, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded grants to three projects that seek to harness this soldier fly's capabilities. This included Chapul Farms, an Oregon-based project development company that's reweaving insects back into American agriculture to eliminate food waste, restore soil health, and produce high-quality animal feed.\nBacked by the Fertilizer Production and Expansion Program (FPEP), the bipartisan support of the use of insects in agriculture highlights the growing recognition of BSFL's potential \u2013 for both waste reduction and for enhancing soil health through the production of high quality domestic fertiliser.\nBut despite the bug's seeming superpowers, the widespread application of BSFL remains limited. The question is: why? And how can companies like Chapul Farms, now equipped with federal support, change that?\nBSFL can consume nearly any kind of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. Facilities like Chapul Farms utilise its voracious appetite to process large quantities of waste, with the larvae consuming up to\u00a0four times their own body waste in organic matter everyday. This happens in a fraction of the time required for traditional composting, which can take up to 10 months. The larvae's efficiency allows for a rapid turnover of organic material into nutrient-rich excrement \u2013 or frass.\n\"They can reproduce pretty quickly too,\" says Shankar Ganapathi Shanmugam, Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University. \"And it [BSFL] grows on dead and decaying material, which means that it can survive on waste.\"\nShanmugam is spearheading research on the use of frass as a crop nutrient, which until now has not been studied in the US \u2013 though it has been studied in other parts of the world, notably in multiple countries across\u00a0Europe.\nChapul collaborates with neighbouring farms to exchange waste for frass, creating a circular system. It's a mutually beneficial exchange as the farms receive nutrient-rich soil amendment and Chapul receives the fuel for their operation. And it's doing something significant for insect populations too: helping to repopulate them.\nThis is because insect farming operations create a controlled environment for the bugs to thrive. The frass created from them\u00a0provides essential nutrients\u00a0to plants and fosters a more biodiverse soil, which encourages the growth of native plant and insect species, thus supporting the overall ecosystem.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"We could make compost out of anything but the impact of running it through this insect biology has all of these [positive] implications,\" says Mimi Casteel, an Oregon wine farmer who has been using Chapul's frass. \"It's exciting for so many reasons: it's a portable, pretty low cost investment compared to some other things that we're considering as part of dealing with our massive problems with waste, and soldier flies are replacing a missing layer of diversity.\"\nChapul has worked with local vineyards, researchers and farms to research, educate and promote frass benefits and adoption in the bioregion. TAINABLE, a local soil restoration non-profit, provides laboratory space and farmland to Chapul for their research.\nAs organic waste production continues to place a massive burden on energy and carbon emissions, there is an increasing need for more efficient and sustainable processing methods. And BSFL's digestive processes can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"Finding a use for this is important, but if you're going to market frass as a fertiliser, you need to regulate it, which takes time,\" says Shanmugam. \"And to make these regulations you need research.\"\nThe US National Organic Program does not include insects as an acceptable additive as of now. This makes it a challenge to share this technique with farmers who use organic practices, though teams like Chapul Farms are in conversations with regulators to increase education around it and usher in its inclusion.\nUnlike chemical fertilisers, which often deplete soil over time, frass promotes biodiversity within the soil by introducing a diverse microbial community. This boosts soil resilience, natural plant defence, improves its ability to retain water, and reduces the need for costly synthetic inputs. In sharp contrast, synthetics can wreck soil biodiversity, beneficial bacteria and the soil's natural micro-ecosystem, leaving it dependent on increasingly expensive inputs. They also have intensive fossil-fuel requirements, and reduce soil's carbon carrying capacity.\n\"We recently saw even more of a push for our government to get projects funded that support domestic fertiliser production,\" says Aly Moore, Chief Communications Officer of Chapul Farms. \"We realise how many health issues are caused by the reduced nutrient density in crops, and all the pesticides used. And on the cost factor, farmers will not only need less fertiliser over time, but also fewer pesticides.\"\nThis can all contribute to cost savings and be more incentive for farmers, especially at a time when fertiliser prices are sky high and supply is unreliable. Prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. With the US being the world's third-largest fertiliser importer, American farmers felt the brunt of this impact; making it not just a fertiliser issue, but also one of food security.\n\"In the two years leading up to 2023, there was an 8% reduction in global fertiliser consumption, because people were priced out of the market,\" says Michael Place, Chief Technology Officer at Chapul Farms. \"There were supply disruptions and even unavailability. And FPEP emerged from this sort of emergency.\"\nSoil microbes present an exciting frontier for regenerating soil health, yet less than 1% of total microbes in soil have been cultivated. Frass provides an opportunity to pivot from the reductionist methods of treating soils that perpetuated the soil crisis in the first place, all while bolstering food and agricultural security.\nFarmers will eventually need less frass to maintain the same levels of soil productivity, as the microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health and resiliency by improving biodiversity.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 A 2,000-year-old method to water crops\n\u2022 The ignored potential of human poo\nFarmers who have begun using frass in their fields are already reporting promising results.\u00a0Casteel is in the midst of facilitating trials to assess the impact of frass on her crops. While the statistical outcome of the study is still in progress, she has already witnessed perceptible changes.\n\"Anecdotally, what I can tell you is that in the trials that I've done both with grapevines and in my vegetable farm, the produce itself comes up faster, it has better cellular structure,\" says Casteel. \"So if you actually cut the leaf and put it under the microscope, the cells grow more densely and they have figure lipid membranes. And what that means is that the plant from day one has more structural integrity,\" she says.\nThe FPEP funds will support construction and equipment for BSFL facilities located in Oregon and North Dakota. The projects anticipate yielding 10,000 tons of frass per location per year and will generate 59 new jobs, upon its opening which is expected to be in 2026.\u00a0\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the nascent insect agriculture industry is the tunnel vision around insects for protein production which has overshadowed the benefits of frass in soil health. While protein from BSFL is a lucrative and fast-growing market, frass remains an underutilised resource in insect agriculture.\nThe global insect protein market was valued at nearly $1 billion in 2022 (\u00a3805m), while global frass was valued at $96 million (\u00a377m) in 2023, and frass's projected growth is substantially higher. Plus, according to the Chapul Farms team, insect farms produce twice as much frass as larvae.\u00a0\n\"I think farmers have historically been convinced that insects are problems, and they just don't want to talk about adding more problems to their situation,\" says Casteel. \"But when our farms become more complex, you start to see an exponential rollout of ecological returns.\"\u00a0\nIn addition, insects are keystone species, meaning entire ecosystems would drastically change or collapse without them \u2013 and our world would \"grind to a halt\", as the biologist Dave Goulson\u00a0wrote in the Guardian newspaper.\u00a0\n\"Ultimately, at its core, we cannot survive without insects,\" says Pat Crowley, CEO of Chapul Farms. \"Natural ecosystems cannot flourish... without the insects as a part of them. And that's one of our biggest premises. It's not as simple as: insects will solve the biggest trends in global agricultural health.

This included Chapul Farms, an Oregon-based project development company that's reweaving insects back into American agriculture to eliminate food waste, restore soil health, and produce high-quality animal feed.\nBacked by the Fertilizer Production and Expansion Program (FPEP), the bipartisan support of the use of insects in agriculture highlights the growing recognition of BSFL's potential \u2013 for both waste reduction and for enhancing soil health through the production of high quality domestic fertiliser.\nBut despite the bug's seeming superpowers, the widespread application of BSFL remains limited. The question is: why? And how can companies like Chapul Farms, now equipped with federal support, change that?\nBSFL can consume nearly any kind of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. Facilities like Chapul Farms utilise its voracious appetite to process large quantities of waste, with the larvae consuming up to\u00a0four times their own body waste in organic matter everyday. This happens in a fraction of the time required for traditional composting, which can take up to 10 months. The larvae's efficiency allows for a rapid turnover of organic material into nutrient-rich excrement \u2013 or frass.\n\"They can reproduce pretty quickly too,\" says Shankar Ganapathi Shanmugam, Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University. \"And it [BSFL] grows on dead and decaying material, which means that it can survive on waste.\"\nShanmugam is spearheading research on the use of frass as a crop nutrient, which until now has not been studied in the US \u2013 though it has been studied in other parts of the world, notably in multiple countries across\u00a0Europe.\nChapul collaborates with neighbouring farms to exchange waste for frass, creating a circular system. It's a mutually beneficial exchange as the farms receive nutrient-rich soil amendment and Chapul receives the fuel for their operation. And it's doing something significant for insect populations too: helping to repopulate them.\nThis is because insect farming operations create a controlled environment for the bugs to thrive. The frass created from them\u00a0provides essential nutrients\u00a0to plants and fosters a more biodiverse soil, which encourages the growth of native plant and insect species, thus supporting the overall ecosystem.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"We could make compost out of anything but the impact of running it through this insect biology has all of these [positive] implications,\" says Mimi Casteel, an Oregon wine farmer who has been using Chapul's frass. \"It's exciting for so many reasons: it's a portable, pretty low cost investment compared to some other things that we're considering as part of dealing with our massive problems with waste, and soldier flies are replacing a missing layer of diversity.\"\nChapul has worked with local vineyards, researchers and farms to research, educate and promote frass benefits and adoption in the bioregion. TAINABLE, a local soil restoration non-profit, provides laboratory space and farmland to Chapul for their research.\nAs organic waste production continues to place a massive burden on energy and carbon emissions, there is an increasing need for more efficient and sustainable processing methods. And BSFL's digestive processes can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"Finding a use for this is important, but if you're going to market frass as a fertiliser, you need to regulate it, which takes time,\" says Shanmugam. \"And to make these regulations you need research.\"\nThe US National Organic Program does not include insects as an acceptable additive as of now. This makes it a challenge to share this technique with farmers who use organic practices, though teams like Chapul Farms are in conversations with regulators to increase education around it and usher in its inclusion.\nUnlike chemical fertilisers, which often deplete soil over time, frass promotes biodiversity within the soil by introducing a diverse microbial community. This boosts soil resilience, natural plant defence, improves its ability to retain water, and reduces the need for costly synthetic inputs. In sharp contrast, synthetics can wreck soil biodiversity, beneficial bacteria and the soil's natural micro-ecosystem, leaving it dependent on increasingly expensive inputs. They also have intensive fossil-fuel requirements, and reduce soil's carbon carrying capacity.\n\"We recently saw even more of a push for our government to get projects funded that support domestic fertiliser production,\" says Aly Moore, Chief Communications Officer of Chapul Farms. \"We realise how many health issues are caused by the reduced nutrient density in crops, and all the pesticides used. And on the cost factor, farmers will not only need less fertiliser over time, but also fewer pesticides.\"\nThis can all contribute to cost savings and be more incentive for farmers, especially at a time when fertiliser prices are sky high and supply is unreliable. Prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. With the US being the world's third-largest fertiliser importer, American farmers felt the brunt of this impact; making it not just a fertiliser issue, but also one of food security.\n\"In the two years leading up to 2023, there was an 8% reduction in global fertiliser consumption, because people were priced out of the market,\" says Michael Place, Chief Technology Officer at Chapul Farms. \"There were supply disruptions and even unavailability. And FPEP emerged from this sort of emergency.\"\nSoil microbes present an exciting frontier for regenerating soil health, yet less than 1% of total microbes in soil have been cultivated. Frass provides an opportunity to pivot from the reductionist methods of treating soils that perpetuated the soil crisis in the first place, all while bolstering food and agricultural security.\nFarmers will eventually need less frass to maintain the same levels of soil productivity, as the microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health and resiliency by improving biodiversity.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 A 2,000-year-old method to water crops\n\u2022 The ignored potential of human poo\nFarmers who have begun using frass in their fields are already reporting promising results.\u00a0Casteel is in the midst of facilitating trials to assess the impact of frass on her crops. While the statistical outcome of the study is still in progress, she has already witnessed perceptible changes.\n\"Anecdotally, what I can tell you is that in the trials that I've done both with grapevines and in my vegetable farm, the produce itself comes up faster, it has better cellular structure,\" says Casteel. \"So if you actually cut the leaf and put it under the microscope, the cells grow more densely and they have figure lipid membranes. And what that means is that the plant from day one has more structural integrity,\" she says.\nThe FPEP funds will support construction and equipment for BSFL facilities located in Oregon and North Dakota. The projects anticipate yielding 10,000 tons of frass per location per year and will generate 59 new jobs, upon its opening which is expected to be in 2026.\u00a0\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the nascent insect agriculture industry is the tunnel vision around insects for protein production which has overshadowed the benefits of frass in soil health. While protein from BSFL is a lucrative and fast-growing market, frass remains an underutilised resource in insect agriculture.\nThe global insect protein market was valued at nearly $1 billion in 2022 (\u00a3805m), while global frass was valued at $96 million (\u00a377m) in 2023, and frass's projected growth is substantially higher. Plus, according to the Chapul Farms team, insect farms produce twice as much frass as larvae.\u00a0\n\"I think farmers have historically been convinced that insects are problems, and they just don't want to talk about adding more problems to their situation,\" says Casteel. \"But when our farms become more complex, you start to see an exponential rollout of ecological returns.\"\u00a0\nIn addition, insects are keystone species, meaning entire ecosystems would drastically change or collapse without them \u2013 and our world would \"grind to a halt\", as the biologist Dave Goulson\u00a0wrote in the Guardian newspaper.\u00a0\n\"Ultimately, at its core, we cannot survive without insects,\" says Pat Crowley, CEO of Chapul Farms. \"Natural ecosystems cannot flourish... without the insects as a part of them. And that's one of our biggest premises. It's not as simple as: insects will solve the biggest trends in global agricultural health. And at the same time, I think it's one of the biggest levers that we have in making agriculture a more resilient, ecosystem-based model.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From fiery festivals to nature's most dazzling \"sky-dance\", interest in the night skies is booming, with \"noctourism\" poised to be a major travel trend in 2025.\nInterest in the night skies is booming. Booking.com recently named \"noctourism\" as a\u00a0top travel trend for 2025, with their survey of more than 27,000 travellers finding that around two-thirds have considered going to \"darker sky destinations\" to experience things like starbathing (lying down and looking at the night skies) and witnessing once-in-a-lifetime cosmic events.\u00a0\n\"The cool thing about night adventures is you see so many different sides to a destination, by just staying up late or rising early,\" says Stephanie Vermillon, author of the new book 100 Nights Of A Lifetime: The World's Ultimate Adventures After Dark. \"Our senses are heightened, and there are things you see at night that you don't see any other time, so everything feels exciting and new.\"\u00a0\nIt was a 2010 trip to Morocco that sparked Vermillon's interest in all things nocturnal. \"I grew up in Dayton, Ohio, which has terrible light pollution,\" she tells the BBC. \"Then I went to the Sahara Desert and camped under the stars \u2013 I saw the Milky Way and two dozen shooting stars that night. I went home, took an astronomy class and later started hunting Northern Lights, which got me curious about what else happens around the world after dark.\"\u00a0\nVermillon believes that major events such as the April 2024 total solar\u00a0eclipse\u00a0or the 2024-2025 peak in aurora activity has led to a \"bump\" in the number of people wanting to experience dark skies. There are also now more than 200 Dark Sky Reserves across the globe. \"The great thing about the night sky is the perspective it gives you \u2013 it's humbling and grounding,\" she says. \"You can experience pure awe.\"\nStarry skies and aurora borealis might be the headline acts, but there's plenty more to do after dark in cities or out in nature. \"You see a city so differently at night,\" Vermillon says. \"I think of it as a city letting its hair down \u2013 it's more relaxed. I've also done night safaris, where it's more about listening than just seeing, and I've seen water sparkling with bioluminescence, which looks like magic. Everything at night has a little extra sparkle.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nHere are five of Vermillon's favourite after-dark experiences, from fiery cultural festivals to nature's greatest sky dance.\nLucky travellers in the right place at the right time can witness one of the most unforgettable experiences on Earth: the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights. Created by charged particles from the Sun colliding with the Earth's atmosphere, the main activity occurs above Earth's magnetic poles, with Iceland right in the thick of the action. During the Northern Lights season (September to April), colourful displays streak across the skies for more than 100 nights, as long as cloud cover doesn't impinge. \"I've never felt goosebumps from nature more than when I'm watching the Northern Lights,\" says Vermillon. \"You're watching nature dance. It's the most magical thing.\"\nStrong storms can be seen with the naked eye, though many photographers also create wondrous images using long exposures on cameras. Witnessing or capturing the aurora usually means wrapping up in thick clothing and waiting for hours on a bracing hillside or glacier, far from towns or cities. But there's a warmer alternative: kicking back in Iceland's naturally heated pools. The land of fire and ice straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with geothermal energy from far below ground creating more than 700 hot springs and pools. \"You can see the Northern Lights in warmth and comfort,\" advises Vermillon. \"The water's often over 100F (38C), so you can see your breath and your hair is frosting, but the water heats you from your core. I got out of the water in a swimsuit to check my camera and I wasn't cold at all.\"\u00a0\nVermillon particularly recommends Ion Adventure Hotel in Selfoss for outdoor pools overlooking lava fields and snow-capped mountains, noting their Northern Lights Bar that serves a Sweet Black Death cocktail; and Heydalur, a guesthouse on a horse farm in the craggy Westfjords, where shaggy white ponies amble around the open-all-night hot pools.\nLocated far out in the North Sea, the Shetland Islands are part of Scotland. But the islands are also geographically and culturally close to Scandinavia. The annual Up Helly Aa festival, which takes place on the last Tuesday of January in Shetland's capital, Lerwick, is a fiery, boozy spectacle that celebrates the island's Viking heritage. Vikings settled here during the 8th and 9th Centuries and lived as farmers for around 600 years before the islands came under Scottish rule in the 15th Century.\u00a0\nAfter months of preparation, the midwinter celebration's main event is a torch-lit procession where around 1,000 \"guizers\" (local men) wearing Viking gear and other eye-catching costumes march through the streets, bringing with them a replica Viking longship that will later be set on fire in a grand spectacle. Afterwards, locals fill community halls and pubs for dancing, music and drinking into the early hours of the morning.\n\"So many cultural festivals are ancient, but this one started around 200 years ago, so it's relatively new,\" says Vermillon. \"They created it as an ode to their Viking heritage. It's cool to see that pride in where people come from. Up Helly Aa's also special for the visuals: night, darkness and fire.\"\nSmaller Up Helly Aa events also also take place across the islands from January to March.\nShetland's northerly location \u2013 closer to the Arctic Circle than London \u2013 means there's a decent chance of seeing the aurora in the winter months, known locally as the \"mirrie dancers\", from mirr, whichmeans \"to shimmer\".\nThe remote Atacama region in northern Chile is the driest nonpolar desert on Earth. With high elevations and an average of 300 clear, cloud-free nights a year, it's a renowned location for professional astronomers. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), one of the most powerful telescope systems anywhere on Earth, was constructed here to study the universe's great mysteries.\u00a0\n\"Atacama has the clearest night skies I've ever seen, and clear skies for as many nights in a row as I've ever had,\" says Vermillon.\u00a0 \u00a0\nAll this means that \"there's a community of entrepreneurs who have created incredible experiences around stargazing\", says Vermillon, including astrophotography tours and archaeoastronomy sessions featuring Indigenous stories about the cosmos, as well as private observatories where experts teach tourists about Southern Hemisphere constellations and more.\nVisiting just before, during or after a new Moon is recommended for the darkest skies and most dramatic starscapes. \"You see a blanket of stars, more stars than you've ever seen in your lifetime, with skies that are darker and more pinpricked than I've ever seen,\" says Vermillon. \"But the landscape around you also makes you feel like you're out there among the stars \u2013 you look around and you feel like you're on Mars or on the Moon. NASA uses parts of Atacama to test for their missions for life on Mars because Atacama has such 'martian' landscapes. Atacama really is next-level.\"\n\"Reading the morning newspaper\" is how wildlife guides across Africa refer to seeing animal tracks and other signs of activity that show what happened during the night, including scuffles or hunts. But taking a night safari means wildlife-lovers can watch, or listen to, the \"news\" for themselves.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n\u2022\u00a0Five of the world's most beautiful climbing locations\n\u2022 Australia\u2019s answer to the Northern Lights\u00a0\nNight-time is when many creatures are most active, especially predators such as lions and leopards, who often rest during the heat of the day, and Vermillon recommends heading to Zambia to experience it. \"Zambia has so many opportunities for night safaris,\" she says, picking out South Luangwa National Park, Lower Zambezi National Park and Kafue National Park (Zambia's oldest and largest national park) for chances to see big cats, elephants and other remarkable creatures. \"You often see leopards lazing in trees by day, but to actually see a leopard stalking around at night, when there are so few people or vehicles, is so different,\" Vermillon says. \"I like watching hyenas at night because you really see their 'creepy' character. I remember watching hyena circling a lion, trying to steal its prey \u2013 incredible.\"\u00a0\nPlenty of other animals are on the move after dark. \"I love bush babies,\" says Vermillon. \"They have such dramatic features \u2013 big ears and oversized, cartoon-like eyes \u2013 and they're a pretty common night-safari find because they're most active at night to avoid predators. I also love night drives for owls. With day safaris, so much is about seeing, but at night the pressure is off and it's more about listening, too, which is a less appreciated part of the safari experience. I love that period around 02:00 where you wake up in camp to hyena laughs or lion roars. You're, like, \"Woah, where am I?\". When you're out on night safaris, it's like you're out there among that. You're watching and listening as the animal kingdom does its thing.\"\nThe smells of Taiwan's food markets might hit you before the sights and sounds as dozens of stalls cook up delicacies, sending smoke and steam from grills, pots and pans drifting into the night air. There are more than 100 night markets across the country, with cooks selling xiaochi, the Chinese word for \"snacks\", to locals and visitors.\nMany of the markets are open from late afternoon into the early hours of the morning or even sunrise, but they're particularly busy when local temples finish their services. \"The majority of Taiwan's temples are Taoist and Buddhist,\" explains Vermillon. \"The night markets usually have a historic temple in the market or right next to it and the vendors popped up around these gathering areas to sell goods and snacks. Over time, they grew into what they are today. People head there after the service to hang out and eat together. In the US, markets can feel touristy, weird or artificial, but I feel like these markets were built to serve a purpose: the community. The markets are built there authentically for people to gather after the temples but it's a cool experience for tourists, too.\"\nThere are more than 30 night markets in the capital, Taipei, including\u00a0Shilin Night Market, the largest and most popular; and Raohe Night Market, among Taipei's oldest, dating to 1987.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Almost every market has a different dish they're known for,\" says Vermillon. \"The oyster omelette is a staple at Shilin Night Market. Raohe Night Market is known for its Fuzhou black pepper bun: a crispy pork bun topped with a black pepper sauce and onions.\" Brave travellers might also want to keep an eye, or nose, out for the fried \"stinky tofu\", a pungently aromatic fermented bean curd dish that is \"very common in the after-hours markets\".\nThe buzzing markets, which also selling clothing, art, crafts and other souvenirs, can get crowded. Be prepared to queue at the best stalls for speciality dishes.\u00a0\n100 Nights of a Lifetime: The World's Ultimate Adventures After Dark by Stephanie Vermillon is published by National Geographic.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993.\nIt sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993.\nBut the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell.\nEven today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book \u2013 based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible \u2013 demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters \u2013 like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 \u2013 or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.\u00a0\nThis space mirror idea was taken up again by German physicists during World War Two. At the Nazi weapons research centre in Hillersleben, scientists worked on a design to build a terrifying reflective orbiting weapon called the Sonnengewehr or Sun gun in German. In 1945, Time magazine reported that captured German scientists had told US Army interrogators that the Sonnengewehr was meant to act as a death ray, refocusing light from the Sun to set fire to cities or boil away water in lakes. Despite facing evident scepticism from their US interrogators as they handed over their technical drawings, the German scientists had believed that their Sun gun could be operational in 50 years, the chief of Allied technical intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel John Keck, told reporters at the time.\nIn the 1970s, another German\u2010born rocket engineer, Dr Krafft Ehricke, again began looking at the concept. Ehricke had been a member of Germany's V-2 rocket team during World War Two. At the end of the war, he surrendered to the US and was recruited as part of Operation Paperclip, wherein 1,600 scientists, engineers and technicians deemed to be valuable were shielded from prosecution, spirited out of Germany, and allowed to continue their work in the US.\nEhricke became part of the US space programme, and in the 1970s he returned to the idea of building a mirror in space. In 1978, he wrote a paper detailing how giant orbiting mirrors could illuminate the night sky, enabling farmers to plant or harvest 24 hours a day, or could be used to deflect sunlight down onto solar panels on Earth to be converted into electricity on demand. He called this idea Power Soletta. Ehricke, a space-travel enthusiast from childhood and a long-time proponent of colonising other planets, died in 1984 without seeing Power Soletta come to fruition. But he would get his long-desired space flight posthumously when his cremated remains were launched into Earth's orbit in 1997 along with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s counterculture psychologist Timothy Leary.\u00a0\nThroughout the 1980s, Nasa looked repeatedly at the concept of generating solar power by harnessing sunlight with an orbiting mirror system called Solares, but despite government interest the project was never able to secure funding. However, in Russia the idea of solar mirrors took root.\u00a0\nAt the time, a Russian scientist called Vladimir Syromiatnikov was investigating whether large reflective solar sails could be attached to a spaceship. Syromiatnikov was a pioneering figure in space engineering breakthroughs. He had worked on the Vostok rocket, the world's first crewed spacecraft that took Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. He also developed an ingenious spacecraft docking mechanism, the Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS). This was used in July 1975 in the Apollo-Soyuz test project, the first joint space flight by the then Cold War enemies, the US and the USSR, in which a US module carrying three astronauts successfully linked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule carrying two cosmonauts in orbit. His APAS was later used to enable US shuttles to dock with the Russian Mir space station and is still used for docking at the International Space Station.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov thought that if solar sails were attached to a spacecraft they could use the Sun in a similar fashion to how ships' sails use the wind. If the reflective sails could be angled correctly then photons, particles of energy coming from the Sun, could bounce off their mirror-like surfaces and gently propel the craft forward through space without it having to burn any fuel.\nHowever, in Russia during the post-Soviet era, getting funding for ambitious space projects like Syromiatnikov's was difficult unless they could demonstrate a clear economic goal. So Syromiatnikov decided to repurpose his concept. He thought that reflective solar sails on a spacecraft in orbit could act as a mirror, with the craft's thrusters used to angle the sails and keep them in sync with the Sun's position. That mirror could be used to beam down light on Russia's polar regions where the days are extremely short in the winter, illuminating areas shrouded in darkness. The extra sunlight would extend the working day and increase the productivity of farmlands. He also envisioned that the bonus sunshine could reduce the cost of electrical lighting and heating for the area and add to the wellbeing of people in the region.\nThis turned out to be an idea that the government could get behind. And so, funded by the Space Regatta Consortium, a group of Russian state-owned companies and agencies, and overseen by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Syromiatnikov began work on making the Znamya space mirror a reality.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nThe first prototype built, Znamya 1, wasn't actually sent into space, but remained on Earth to be tested so that Syromiatnikov could iron out any technical problems. Znamya 2 was to be the first to go into orbit. Its mirror was made from thin sheets of aluminised Mylar, a lightweight highly reflective material which was thought to be sturdy enough to survive the hostile conditions in space. It was designed to unfurl in eight sections into a circular shape from a rotating central drum mechanism and stay in that form through centrifugal force.\u00a0\n\"During the flight the reflector is wrapped tightly around the body of the craft, and to open it the craft will have to spin round rapidly forcing it out like an umbrella,\" explained the BBC's Bellingham to TV viewers in 1992. \"The trick is that at this height the 20m-wide reflector will then be able to capture the Sun's rays which normally bypass the Earth and reflect them down onto the dark side of our planet.\"\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov's plan was to have multiple Znamya launches, each one with a larger mirror that burned up as it came back to Earth. Russian engineers would be able to study how Znamya's thin reflective sheets performed when they were activated in space, and perfect his design. This would lead to the launch of a permanent Znamya with a massive 200m-wide reflector that would stay in orbit around Earth.\nThe ultimate ambition was to have a grid of up to 36 of these giant mirrors in space with the ability to pivot, enabling them to keep the reflected light targeted on the same spot. A single reflector could be used to light up a peculiar area. \"On a clear night the space reflector could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium, bringing some light relief to the long winter nights,\" said Bellingham. Or multiple reflectors could focus light together to bring greater brightness or illuminate a bigger region. It was estimated that the combined space mirror grid would be able to reflect light 50 times brighter than the Moon and illuminate an area up to 50 miles (90km) across.\u00a0\nOn 27 October 1992, the project was ready, and the crewless spacecraft Progress M-15 launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Znamya 2 on board. After the cargo supply craft docked with the Russian space station, Mir's crew fitted the drum containing the folded reflective solar sheets into position on the Progress spacecraft. Znamya 2 was due to be trialled towards the end of the year, but its deployment was delayed while the Mir crew conducted tests for other upcoming missions. On 4 February 1993, they were finally ready to put the plan into action.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Training for the Apollo 11 Moon mission\n\u2022\u00a0Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\n\u2022\u00a0The 'alien invasion' that scared the US\nThe autonomous Progress spacecraft undocked, and once it was at a distance of some 150m from Mir, it began to rotate, unfurling the mirror like a giant fan which caught the Sun's rays and beamed them back down to Earth.\nThe reflected light had a luminosity roughly equivalent to a full moon and created a spotlight about three miles (5km) wide on Earth. At a speed of five miles per second (8km per second) the patch of light raced from southern France through Switzerland, Germany, and Poland across to western Russia. The crew on Mir were able to see a faint beam of light as it swept through Europe, and despite much of the continent being covered in clouds that day, some people on the ground reported witnessing it as a flash of light. After a few hours, the space mirror deorbited and burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere over Canada.\u00a0\nBack in Russia, the Znamya 2 experiment was hailed as a technical success \u2013 but it also demonstrated some significant challenges for the project. Znamya 2's reflected light had proved much less intense than expected and too diffused to provide practical illumination for a large area on Earth. It had also been tricky maintaining Znamya 2's stability in orbital conditions, and its spotlight's rapid journey across the Earth's surface and fleeting visibility made its real-world uses seem limited.\nBut the mission had provided encouraging results and valuable insights, so Syromiatnikov ploughed ahead with his planned follow-up experiment, Znamya 2.5. This time it would have a 25m mirror, reflecting a luminosity of between five and 10 full moons, and shining a spot of light that would cover an area five miles (8km) wide. The intention was to control the direction of the reflected light beam so it could target a spot on the Earth for several minutes at a time as Znamya 2.5 revolved around the Earth. Two cities in North America were picked to be illuminated by the mirror's sun ray during what would be a 24-hour experiment, as well as several in Europe.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov was heartened by the progress his team was making, and the launch was planned for October 1998. \"We are pioneers in the field,\" he told The Moscow Times in July 1998. \"If the experiment goes according to plan, we propose to send dozens more craft into space in the future on a permanent basis.\"\nBut even before Znamya 2.5 left the ground, Russian space officials began receiving complaints. Astronomers were worried that the mirror would pollute the night sky with light, dazzling their telescopes and obscure their view of the stars. The Royal Astronomical Society went so far as to protest to the Director General of the Space Regatta Consortium about the experiment. Ecologists also raised concerns that its artificial light might cause confusion to animals and plants, disrupting wildlife and nature cycles.\u00a0\nDespite these misgivings, there was considerable global attention and excitement about the Znamya project's potential implications. \"Think what it will mean for the future of mankind,\" Syromiatnikov told The Moscow Times. \"No more electricity bills, no more long, dark winters. This is a serious breakthrough for technology.\" And so, the Znamya 2.5's launch went ahead as planned, and with Mission Control monitoring from Moscow, the larger space mirror was primed to deploy on 5 February 1999.\nAt first everything went as planned; the folded-up space mirror had been attached to Progress, which undocked from Mir without a hitch. It smoothly moved into position away from the space station, Progress's thrusters were commanded to fire, and it began to spin to unfurl the foil mirror. Unfortunately, at the same time an extra command was sent to Progress by mistake, telling it to deploy the antenna it used to communicate for docking manoeuvres. As the antenna extended, Znamya 2.5's thin reflective sheets immediately became caught up in it.\nMission Control in Moscow watched in dismay as footage of the tangled mirror beamed back from Mir, and frantic commands were sent to retract the antenna. But by this time, several yards of foil had already become wrapped around it, tearing the mirror in several places. Realising that they were in danger of ripping the reflective sheets further, the commands were paused. A second desperate attempt to spin the mirror free was tried an hour later, but to no avail.\nCrestfallen, Mission Control recognised that the Znamya 2.5's torn and crumpled mirror could never be unfurled, and allowed it to fall to Earth still attached to the Progress craft. It burnt up in the atmosphere the following day over the Pacific Ocean. \"The mood here is very depressed,\" Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for the Mission Control in Moscow, told the BBC at the time.\u00a0\nIts fall to Earth did not just destroy Znamya 2.5 but the future of Syromiatnikov's idealistic space mirror project. His planned Znamya 3 with a 70m reflecting surface, which was meant to launch in 2001, could not secure funding and was never built. Syromiatnikov, widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding space engineers of his generation, died in 2006, his dreams of solar sails and mirrors unrealised.\u00a0\n\"The failure was especially painful because of the huge worldwide interest that the experiment aroused,\" Lyndin told the BBC in 1999. \"We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programmes \u2013 to do something first and boast about it only after.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993.\nIt sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993.\nBut the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell.\nEven today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one.

        "article_text": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993.\nIt sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993.\nBut the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell.\nEven today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book \u2013 based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible \u2013 demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters \u2013 like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 \u2013 or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.\u00a0\nThis space mirror idea was taken up again by German physicists during World War Two. At the Nazi weapons research centre in Hillersleben, scientists worked on a design to build a terrifying reflective orbiting weapon called the Sonnengewehr or Sun gun in German. In 1945, Time magazine reported that captured German scientists had told US Army interrogators that the Sonnengewehr was meant to act as a death ray, refocusing light from the Sun to set fire to cities or boil away water in lakes. Despite facing evident scepticism from their US interrogators as they handed over their technical drawings, the German scientists had believed that their Sun gun could be operational in 50 years, the chief of Allied technical intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel John Keck, told reporters at the time.\nIn the 1970s, another German\u2010born rocket engineer, Dr Krafft Ehricke, again began looking at the concept. Ehricke had been a member of Germany's V-2 rocket team during World War Two. At the end of the war, he surrendered to the US and was recruited as part of Operation Paperclip, wherein 1,600 scientists, engineers and technicians deemed to be valuable were shielded from prosecution, spirited out of Germany, and allowed to continue their work in the US.\nEhricke became part of the US space programme, and in the 1970s he returned to the idea of building a mirror in space. In 1978, he wrote a paper detailing how giant orbiting mirrors could illuminate the night sky, enabling farmers to plant or harvest 24 hours a day, or could be used to deflect sunlight down onto solar panels on Earth to be converted into electricity on demand. He called this idea Power Soletta. Ehricke, a space-travel enthusiast from childhood and a long-time proponent of colonising other planets, died in 1984 without seeing Power Soletta come to fruition. But he would get his long-desired space flight posthumously when his cremated remains were launched into Earth's orbit in 1997 along with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s counterculture psychologist Timothy Leary.\u00a0\nThroughout the 1980s, Nasa looked repeatedly at the concept of generating solar power by harnessing sunlight with an orbiting mirror system called Solares, but despite government interest the project was never able to secure funding. However, in Russia the idea of solar mirrors took root.\u00a0\nAt the time, a Russian scientist called Vladimir Syromiatnikov was investigating whether large reflective solar sails could be attached to a spaceship. Syromiatnikov was a pioneering figure in space engineering breakthroughs. He had worked on the Vostok rocket, the world's first crewed spacecraft that took Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. He also developed an ingenious spacecraft docking mechanism, the Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS). This was used in July 1975 in the Apollo-Soyuz test project, the first joint space flight by the then Cold War enemies, the US and the USSR, in which a US module carrying three astronauts successfully linked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule carrying two cosmonauts in orbit. His APAS was later used to enable US shuttles to dock with the Russian Mir space station and is still used for docking at the International Space Station.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov thought that if solar sails were attached to a spacecraft they could use the Sun in a similar fashion to how ships' sails use the wind. If the reflective sails could be angled correctly then photons, particles of energy coming from the Sun, could bounce off their mirror-like surfaces and gently propel the craft forward through space without it having to burn any fuel.\nHowever, in Russia during the post-Soviet era, getting funding for ambitious space projects like Syromiatnikov's was difficult unless they could demonstrate a clear economic goal. So Syromiatnikov decided to repurpose his concept. He thought that reflective solar sails on a spacecraft in orbit could act as a mirror, with the craft's thrusters used to angle the sails and keep them in sync with the Sun's position. That mirror could be used to beam down light on Russia's polar regions where the days are extremely short in the winter, illuminating areas shrouded in darkness. The extra sunlight would extend the working day and increase the productivity of farmlands. He also envisioned that the bonus sunshine could reduce the cost of electrical lighting and heating for the area and add to the wellbeing of people in the region.\nThis turned out to be an idea that the government could get behind. And so, funded by the Space Regatta Consortium, a group of Russian state-owned companies and agencies, and overseen by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Syromiatnikov began work on making the Znamya space mirror a reality.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nThe first prototype built, Znamya 1, wasn't actually sent into space, but remained on Earth to be tested so that Syromiatnikov could iron out any technical problems. Znamya 2 was to be the first to go into orbit. Its mirror was made from thin sheets of aluminised Mylar, a lightweight highly reflective material which was thought to be sturdy enough to survive the hostile conditions in space. It was designed to unfurl in eight sections into a circular shape from a rotating central drum mechanism and stay in that form through centrifugal force.\u00a0\n\"During the flight the reflector is wrapped tightly around the body of the craft, and to open it the craft will have to spin round rapidly forcing it out like an umbrella,\" explained the BBC's Bellingham to TV viewers in 1992. \"The trick is that at this height the 20m-wide reflector will then be able to capture the Sun's rays which normally bypass the Earth and reflect them down onto the dark side of our planet.\"\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov's plan was to have multiple Znamya launches, each one with a larger mirror that burned up as it came back to Earth. Russian engineers would be able to study how Znamya's thin reflective sheets performed when they were activated in space, and perfect his design. This would lead to the launch of a permanent Znamya with a massive 200m-wide reflector that would stay in orbit around Earth.\nThe ultimate ambition was to have a grid of up to 36 of these giant mirrors in space with the ability to pivot, enabling them to keep the reflected light targeted on the same spot. A single reflector could be used to light up a peculiar area. \"On a clear night the space reflector could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium, bringing some light relief to the long winter nights,\" said Bellingham. Or multiple reflectors could focus light together to bring greater brightness or illuminate a bigger region. It was estimated that the combined space mirror grid would be able to reflect light 50 times brighter than the Moon and illuminate an area up to 50 miles (90km) across.\u00a0\nOn 27 October 1992, the project was ready, and the crewless spacecraft Progress M-15 launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Znamya 2 on board. After the cargo supply craft docked with the Russian space station, Mir's crew fitted the drum containing the folded reflective solar sheets into position on the Progress spacecraft. Znamya 2 was due to be trialled towards the end of the year, but its deployment was delayed while the Mir crew conducted tests for other upcoming missions. On 4 February 1993, they were finally ready to put the plan into action.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Training for the Apollo 11 Moon mission\n\u2022\u00a0Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\n\u2022\u00a0The 'alien invasion' that scared the US\nThe autonomous Progress spacecraft undocked, and once it was at a distance of some 150m from Mir, it began to rotate, unfurling the mirror like a giant fan which caught the Sun's rays and beamed them back down to Earth.\nThe reflected light had a luminosity roughly equivalent to a full moon and created a spotlight about three miles (5km) wide on Earth. At a speed of five miles per second (8km per second) the patch of light raced from southern France through Switzerland, Germany, and Poland across to western Russia. The crew on Mir were able to see a faint beam of light as it swept through Europe, and despite much of the continent being covered in clouds that day, some people on the ground reported witnessing it as a flash of light. After a few hours, the space mirror deorbited and burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere over Canada.\u00a0\nBack in Russia, the Znamya 2 experiment was hailed as a technical success \u2013 but it also demonstrated some significant challenges for the project. Znamya 2's reflected light had proved much less intense than expected and too diffused to provide practical illumination for a large area on Earth. It had also been tricky maintaining Znamya 2's stability in orbital conditions, and its spotlight's rapid journey across the Earth's surface and fleeting visibility made its real-world uses seem limited.\nBut the mission had provided encouraging results and valuable insights, so Syromiatnikov ploughed ahead with his planned follow-up experiment, Znamya 2.5. This time it would have a 25m mirror, reflecting a luminosity of between five and 10 full moons, and shining a spot of light that would cover an area five miles (8km) wide. The intention was to control the direction of the reflected light beam so it could target a spot on the Earth for several minutes at a time as Znamya 2.5 revolved around the Earth. Two cities in North America were picked to be illuminated by the mirror's sun ray during what would be a 24-hour experiment, as well as several in Europe.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov was heartened by the progress his team was making, and the launch was planned for October 1998. \"We are pioneers in the field,\" he told The Moscow Times in July 1998. \"If the experiment goes according to plan, we propose to send dozens more craft into space in the future on a permanent basis.\"\nBut even before Znamya 2.5 left the ground, Russian space officials began receiving complaints. Astronomers were worried that the mirror would pollute the night sky with light, dazzling their telescopes and obscure their view of the stars. The Royal Astronomical Society went so far as to protest to the Director General of the Space Regatta Consortium about the experiment. Ecologists also raised concerns that its artificial light might cause confusion to animals and plants, disrupting wildlife and nature cycles.\u00a0\nDespite these misgivings, there was considerable global attention and excitement about the Znamya project's potential implications. \"Think what it will mean for the future of mankind,\" Syromiatnikov told The Moscow Times. \"No more electricity bills, no more long, dark winters. This is a serious breakthrough for technology.\" And so, the Znamya 2.5's launch went ahead as planned, and with Mission Control monitoring from Moscow, the larger space mirror was primed to deploy on 5 February 1999.\nAt first everything went as planned; the folded-up space mirror had been attached to Progress, which undocked from Mir without a hitch. It smoothly moved into position away from the space station, Progress's thrusters were commanded to fire, and it began to spin to unfurl the foil mirror. Unfortunately, at the same time an extra command was sent to Progress by mistake, telling it to deploy the antenna it used to communicate for docking manoeuvres. As the antenna extended, Znamya 2.5's thin reflective sheets immediately became caught up in it.\nMission Control in Moscow watched in dismay as footage of the tangled mirror beamed back from Mir, and frantic commands were sent to retract the antenna. But by this time, several yards of foil had already become wrapped around it, tearing the mirror in several places. Realising that they were in danger of ripping the reflective sheets further, the commands were paused. A second desperate attempt to spin the mirror free was tried an hour later, but to no avail.\nCrestfallen, Mission Control recognised that the Znamya 2.5's torn and crumpled mirror could never be unfurled, and allowed it to fall to Earth still attached to the Progress craft. It burnt up in the atmosphere the following day over the Pacific Ocean. \"The mood here is very depressed,\" Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for the Mission Control in Moscow, told the BBC at the time.\u00a0\nIts fall to Earth did not just destroy Znamya 2.5 but the future of Syromiatnikov's idealistic space mirror project. His planned Znamya 3 with a 70m reflecting surface, which was meant to launch in 2001, could not secure funding and was never built. Syromiatnikov, widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding space engineers of his generation, died in 2006, his dreams of solar sails and mirrors unrealised.\u00a0\n\"The failure was especially painful because of the huge worldwide interest that the experiment aroused,\" Lyndin told the BBC in 1999. \"We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programmes \u2013 to do something first and boast about it only after.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nHe joined Manchester United at the age of seven.\nTwenty years, 426 appearances, 138 goals and five trophies later, Marcus Rashford has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nIt will seem strange to see Rashford - the boy from Wythenshawe, United through and through - wearing another team's strip.\nAs recently as November, the idea seemed fanciful.\nHow did we get here?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIn public, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim tried to counter the view that he wanted to jettison Rashford.\nBut United insiders believe the former Sporting boss felt it would be better for everyone if the forward was no longer around.\nEven towards the back end of last week, there was still hopeful talk of a resolution on Rashford's part. Now the reality is sinking in. Amorim has got his way.\nWhat has been very difficult to pinpoint, even though Amorim has given some frank interviews, is the detailed reasoning why the coach was so willing to let him leave.\nIt was all sparked when Amorim dropped Rashford for the Manchester derby on 15 December.\nThree days earlier, the forward had been substituted 11 minutes into the second half of what looked like being an embarrassing Europa League defeat by Czech side Viktoria Plzen.\nRasmus Hojlund came on to replace him and scored two goals to turn the match into a 2-1 win.\nRashford has been omitted from 11 of 12 squads since.\nThe one time he did make a squad - the 2-0 home Premier League defeat by Newcastle on 30 December - he was left on the bench. Afterwards, Amorim was asked why.\nWhen he had to address the subject again before Thursday's Europa League win over Romanian side FCSB, Amorim seemed as if he was starting to get irritated.\nThere is no doubt he has used the Rashford situation as a test of his strength. Sir Alex Ferguson, an illustrious predecessor, may well have approved.\n\"If the coach has no control, he will not last,\" Ferguson explained in a case study for Harvard Business School, published in the weeks after his retirement in 2013.\n\"You have to achieve a position of comprehensive control. Players must recognise that as the manager, you have the status to control events. Before I came to United, I told myself I wasn't going to allow anyone to be stronger than I was. Your personality has to be bigger than theirs.\"\nAmorim's latest comments on the Rashford saga were not as polished but the sentiment was the same.\n\"You [the media] want to make it personal,\" said Amorim. \"I have nothing against Marcus but I have to make the same rules for everybody.\"\nIt was more or less the same message Amorim delivered at the Etihad Stadium in dropping Rashford and forward Alejandro Garnacho for the Manchester derby win over City.\nIn various forms, it has been repeated at least half a dozen times in the interim.\n\"It's important, the performance in training, the performance in the games, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with your team-mates, the way you push your team-mates, everything is important in the context of beginning something, when we want to change a lot of things,\" Amorim outlined. \n\"It's the small details. When people in our club are losing their jobs, we have to put the standards really high.\"\nRashford scored three times in Amorim's first two league games, but hadn't been on the field for the last 12 matches\nRashford responded to that forceful assertion by using a visit to his old school to tell football writer Henry Winter he was ready for \"a new challenge\".\nThat was widely interpreted to mean the player wanted to leave. But sources close to Rashford explained that, as they understood it, he was voicing a general feeling of frustration rather than a desire to try something new.\nThey say he felt he was being eased out of a club he remained attached to - a club he felt he knew far better than those running it.\nClub sources say Rashford has trained well. Unlike Jadon Sancho, who fell out with former United boss Erik ten Hag, again over standards, Rashford was not banished to a different area of the Carrington training ground and told to change on his own.\nWhile Rashford's body language has not always presented the most positive image, recent open training showed a different side.\nDuring the 15-minute sessions broadcast before the Europa League matches against Rangers and FCSB, Rashford was expressive and light-hearted.\nWhen Amorim 'ran the gauntlet' through the first-team squad to mark his 40th birthday, Rashford was among those in the line, smiling after the United boss had charged through.\nThis video can not be played\nMarcus Rashford's best Premier League goals\nIt has never been plain sailing for Rashford at United.\nA succession of managers have felt at times they were not getting the most out of a player with blinding speed, excellent balance and an eye for goal.\nFor the 2022-23 season, the first under Ten Hag, Rashford was diligent, going to the United States for personal sessions to ensure he was ready to go when the real preparations began.\nThe reward was a career-high 30 goals. It is a strike rate no-one else in the United squad can match and is the chief reason why representatives spent time visiting some of European football's biggest clubs - Barcelona, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund - gauging interest and trying to work out what kind of a deal was possible before the transfer window closed.\nBut was the goals output confirmation of Rashford's talent or the exception amid more mediocre returns in recent times?\nThe season before, he found the net twice in his final 28 appearances. Since August 2023, he has scored 15 in total. The drop-off is alarming. Even sources close to the 27-year-old accept he is not playing well.\nHowever, despite missing the past 11 games, he is still United's joint-fourth highest scorer this season with seven, the same as \u00a372m signing Hojlund, who has played four more games.\nOnly Amad Diallo (six), Bruno Fernandes (five) and Hojlund (four) have scored more goals under Amorim than Rashford (three), who has only been on the pitch in 35% of the new head coach's games at United.\nUnited's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney has told Rashford in private he should leave.

Now the reality is sinking in. Amorim has got his way.\nWhat has been very difficult to pinpoint, even though Amorim has given some frank interviews, is the detailed reasoning why the coach was so willing to let him leave.\nIt was all sparked when Amorim dropped Rashford for the Manchester derby on 15 December.\nThree days earlier, the forward had been substituted 11 minutes into the second half of what looked like being an embarrassing Europa League defeat by Czech side Viktoria Plzen.\nRasmus Hojlund came on to replace him and scored two goals to turn the match into a 2-1 win.\nRashford has been omitted from 11 of 12 squads since.\nThe one time he did make a squad - the 2-0 home Premier League defeat by Newcastle on 30 December - he was left on the bench. Afterwards, Amorim was asked why.\nWhen he had to address the subject again before Thursday's Europa League win over Romanian side FCSB, Amorim seemed as if he was starting to get irritated.\nThere is no doubt he has used the Rashford situation as a test of his strength. Sir Alex Ferguson, an illustrious predecessor, may well have approved.\n\"If the coach has no control, he will not last,\" Ferguson explained in a case study for Harvard Business School, published in the weeks after his retirement in 2013.\n\"You have to achieve a position of comprehensive control. Players must recognise that as the manager, you have the status to control events. Before I came to United, I told myself I wasn't going to allow anyone to be stronger than I was. Your personality has to be bigger than theirs.\"\nAmorim's latest comments on the Rashford saga were not as polished but the sentiment was the same.\n\"You [the media] want to make it personal,\" said Amorim. \"I have nothing against Marcus but I have to make the same rules for everybody.\"\nIt was more or less the same message Amorim delivered at the Etihad Stadium in dropping Rashford and forward Alejandro Garnacho for the Manchester derby win over City.\nIn various forms, it has been repeated at least half a dozen times in the interim.\n\"It's important, the performance in training, the performance in the games, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with your team-mates, the way you push your team-mates, everything is important in the context of beginning something, when we want to change a lot of things,\" Amorim outlined. \n\"It's the small details. When people in our club are losing their jobs, we have to put the standards really high.\"\nRashford scored three times in Amorim's first two league games, but hadn't been on the field for the last 12 matches\nRashford responded to that forceful assertion by using a visit to his old school to tell football writer Henry Winter he was ready for \"a new challenge\".\nThat was widely interpreted to mean the player wanted to leave. But sources close to Rashford explained that, as they understood it, he was voicing a general feeling of frustration rather than a desire to try something new.\nThey say he felt he was being eased out of a club he remained attached to - a club he felt he knew far better than those running it.\nClub sources say Rashford has trained well. Unlike Jadon Sancho, who fell out with former United boss Erik ten Hag, again over standards, Rashford was not banished to a different area of the Carrington training ground and told to change on his own.\nWhile Rashford's body language has not always presented the most positive image, recent open training showed a different side.\nDuring the 15-minute sessions broadcast before the Europa League matches against Rangers and FCSB, Rashford was expressive and light-hearted.\nWhen Amorim 'ran the gauntlet' through the first-team squad to mark his 40th birthday, Rashford was among those in the line, smiling after the United boss had charged through.\nThis video can not be played\nMarcus Rashford's best Premier League goals\nIt has never been plain sailing for Rashford at United.\nA succession of managers have felt at times they were not getting the most out of a player with blinding speed, excellent balance and an eye for goal.\nFor the 2022-23 season, the first under Ten Hag, Rashford was diligent, going to the United States for personal sessions to ensure he was ready to go when the real preparations began.\nThe reward was a career-high 30 goals. It is a strike rate no-one else in the United squad can match and is the chief reason why representatives spent time visiting some of European football's biggest clubs - Barcelona, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund - gauging interest and trying to work out what kind of a deal was possible before the transfer window closed.\nBut was the goals output confirmation of Rashford's talent or the exception amid more mediocre returns in recent times?\nThe season before, he found the net twice in his final 28 appearances. Since August 2023, he has scored 15 in total. The drop-off is alarming. Even sources close to the 27-year-old accept he is not playing well.\nHowever, despite missing the past 11 games, he is still United's joint-fourth highest scorer this season with seven, the same as \u00a372m signing Hojlund, who has played four more games.\nOnly Amad Diallo (six), Bruno Fernandes (five) and Hojlund (four) have scored more goals under Amorim than Rashford (three), who has only been on the pitch in 35% of the new head coach's games at United.\nUnited's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney has told Rashford in private he should leave.

        "article_text": "This ancient snack is synonymous with Tibetan New Year and will soon be prepared by millions of families.\nAt the entrance of the Kemgun Gumba monastery in Lukla, Nepal, an indigo-blue sign reads \"dining\". Inside, nearly a dozen women and a few men are hard at work, hunched over long tables, deftly mixing, rolling and slicing dough into thin rectangular strips. Each strip is slit in the middle, and one side of the dough is pulled into a ribbon-like bow. The rhythmic pounding of dough punctuates the crackle of oil sizzling in a large vessel outside, as boys and girls transform the doughy strips into deep-fried khapse (kha zas\u00a0in Tibetan), a sweet, crunchy snack central to Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists.\n\"Kha means 'mouth', and sey means 'snack',\" said chef Yeshi Jampa, co-author of the book Taste Tibet and founder of the eponymous Taste Tibet restaurant in Oxford. \"It's a symbol of [Tibetan] New Year,\" or Losar, he added.\nEvery year, millions of Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, India and elsewhere celebrate Losar (lo\u00a0means \"year\" and\u00a0gsar means \"new\"). The 15-day festival (which starts 28 February 2025) occurs on the first day of the Tibetan Lunar calendar and celebrates renewal and new beginnings. The first three days of the festival are considered the most important when followers visit monasteries, offer ceremonial scarves, receive blessings from Rinpoches (respected Tibetan teachers or lamas) and prepare special dishes with friends and family \u2013 especially khapse.\nEating khapse on Losar is thought to bring warmth, peace and tranquillity in the new year, and preparing it is both an art and a labour-intensive process. The dough (made of wheat flour, butter, sugar and oil with an optional egg) is kneaded, rolled and shaped into designs like flowers, knots and braids before being and fried in ghee (clarified butter).\nAccording to Geshema Delek Dolma, a nun at Dolma Ling Nunnery in northern India's Himachal Pradesh state, the history of khapse is intertwined with early Bon rituals \u2013 the indigenous religion practised across the Tibetan plateau before the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th Century CE \u2013 where blood offerings were made to deities.\n\"[Instead] of animal sacrifice, the custom evolved into offering khapse, which was sometimes coloured red as a symbolic gesture,\" Dolma said. \"The practice eventually spread to the other two provinces [Amdo and Kham] of\u00a0Tibet.\"\nKhapse-making is a communal activity.Itrequires many hands to prepare the honey-golden pastries in large quantities so it can be distributed to friends, family and across the community. So in the days ahead of Losar, family members come together to prepare large batches of khapse.\n\"It depends on how much quantity [of khapse] you have to make,\" said Kanchhi Maya Sherpa, who runs the Hotel Sherwi Hyul in Kathmandu. \"It's impossible for one [or] two people to make it as we need to knead the mixture together for a long time. Working together in the Gumba [monastery] is community work.\"\nFollowers first offer khapse to the deities as part of their religious practice, and afterwards, the crunchy treat is shared with others, including the poor, as a means of charity. \"This is always the tradition because Tibetans believe in the service of others before self,\" said Jampa.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Chhurpi: The world's hardest cheese?\n\u2022 The world's higest train line\n\u2022 After 100 hours in Tibet, I knew it was time to leave\nAs Jamyang Norbu, author of the book Echoes From Forgotten Mountains, notes on his blog, the first piece of khapse isn't actually eaten or offered. Instead, it's customary to shape the dough in a scorpion-shaped cookie, fry it and then place it outside the kitchen until \"the 15th day of the New Year to ward off bad luck and possible accidents that could take place during the [khapse]-making\".\n\"Traditionally, it was believed that making khapse could predict success for the upcoming year,\" explained Dolma. For example, oil spilling during the frying process was considered a bad omen. Jampa recalled an accident from his childhood that ruined his family's New Year celebrations. \"[It meant] evil,\" he said, noting how preparing the snack is steeped in cultural beliefs.\nKhapse recipes and the shapes the snack takes vary across regions and families. In Tibet's Markam County, where Jampa grew up, khapse was traditionally sweetened with organic honey from their beehives instead of sugar. Khapse made with honey \"makes the biscuit a little softer\", he explained. \"The sweetness of honey-made khapse arrives more slowly.\" In contrast, recipes that call for sugar have a crunchier texture.\n\"Different parts of Tibet mould khapse differently [and] in different shapes,\" Jampa said. \"I am from Kham. In my village, we make less ornate\u00a0khapse, known as\u00a0kong-chen \u2013 a narrow rectangular piece of dough with a cut in the middle through which one side of the\u00a0khapse\u00a0is pulled through.\" Another style, the hrug-hrug, \"are basically just small rectangles or triangles of dough that require no further work\", Jampa explained.\nKhapse is also deeply connected to Buddhist rituals. During Losar, flowers, fruits, grains, nuts, salt, butter and water are placed on the altar, as offerings to deities, alongside stacks of khapse arranged in towers called derga.\n\"Derga khapses are different shapes, compared to the khapses that we eat,\" my Tibetan friend, Tenzin Diki, told me. \"We add khapse in the shape of a crescent moon and a sun on the derga. We also add beautiful kharu (smaller, ornately designed pieces of khapse) on the derga, and decorate it with chhurpi [traditional cheese], sweets [and] rock sugar.\"\nToday, these fried cookies have evolved in style and shape and are eaten throughout the year. Khapse is sold year-round at stores in Kathmandu and many families prepare it as a snack outside of Losar. A quick online search for \"khapse\" or \"khapsey\" shows legions of home chefs and food bloggers experimenting with moulding the cookies and preparing them with additional ingredients like banana, beetroot, spinach and more.\n\"These days, people have modernised khapse, using their creativity, adding motifs to shape it differently,\" Sherpa explained. \"The shapes now depend on how much creativity one has. You can make it in any shape you want.\"\nYet, not everyone embraces these innovations. \"We have to keep traditional things traditional,\" said Jampa. \"[Khapse] is a special ceremony snack, a symbol of family effort and [it] reminds us that it is something special.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This ancient snack is synonymous with Tibetan New Year and will soon be prepared by millions of families.\nAt the entrance of the Kemgun Gumba monastery in Lukla, Nepal, an indigo-blue sign reads \"dining\". Inside, nearly a dozen women and a few men are hard at work, hunched over long tables, deftly mixing, rolling and slicing dough into thin rectangular strips. Each strip is slit in the middle, and one side of the dough is pulled into a ribbon-like bow. The rhythmic pounding of dough punctuates the crackle of oil sizzling in a large vessel outside, as boys and girls transform the doughy strips into deep-fried khapse (kha zas\u00a0in Tibetan), a sweet, crunchy snack central to Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists.\n\"Kha means 'mouth', and sey means 'snack',\" said chef Yeshi Jampa, co-author of the book Taste Tibet and founder of the eponymous Taste Tibet restaurant in Oxford. \"It's a symbol of [Tibetan] New Year,\" or Losar, he added.\nEvery year, millions of Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, India and elsewhere celebrate Losar (lo\u00a0means \"year\" and\u00a0gsar means \"new\"). The 15-day festival (which starts 28 February 2025) occurs on the first day of the Tibetan Lunar calendar and celebrates renewal and new beginnings. The first three days of the festival are considered the most important when followers visit monasteries, offer ceremonial scarves, receive blessings from Rinpoches (respected Tibetan teachers or lamas) and prepare special dishes with friends and family \u2013 especially khapse.\nEating khapse on Losar is thought to bring warmth, peace and tranquillity in the new year, and preparing it is both an art and a labour-intensive process. The dough (made of wheat flour, butter, sugar and oil with an optional egg) is kneaded, rolled and shaped into designs like flowers, knots and braids before being and fried in ghee (clarified butter).\nAccording to Geshema Delek Dolma, a nun at Dolma Ling Nunnery in northern India's Himachal Pradesh state, the history of khapse is intertwined with early Bon rituals \u2013 the indigenous religion practised across the Tibetan plateau before the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th Century CE \u2013 where blood offerings were made to deities.\n\"[Instead] of animal sacrifice, the custom evolved into offering khapse, which was sometimes coloured red as a symbolic gesture,\" Dolma said. \"The practice eventually spread to the other two provinces [Amdo and Kham] of\u00a0Tibet.\"\nKhapse-making is a communal activity.Itrequires many hands to prepare the honey-golden pastries in large quantities so it can be distributed to friends, family and across the community. So in the days ahead of Losar, family members come together to prepare large batches of khapse.\n\"It depends on how much quantity [of khapse] you have to make,\" said Kanchhi Maya Sherpa, who runs the Hotel Sherwi Hyul in Kathmandu. \"It's impossible for one [or] two people to make it as we need to knead the mixture together for a long time. Working together in the Gumba [monastery] is community work.\"\nFollowers first offer khapse to the deities as part of their religious practice, and afterwards, the crunchy treat is shared with others, including the poor, as a means of charity. \"This is always the tradition because Tibetans believe in the service of others before self,\" said Jampa.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Chhurpi: The world's hardest cheese?\n\u2022 The world's higest train line\n\u2022 After 100 hours in Tibet, I knew it was time to leave\nAs Jamyang Norbu, author of the book Echoes From Forgotten Mountains, notes on his blog, the first piece of khapse isn't actually eaten or offered. Instead, it's customary to shape the dough in a scorpion-shaped cookie, fry it and then place it outside the kitchen until \"the 15th day of the New Year to ward off bad luck and possible accidents that could take place during the [khapse]-making\".\n\"Traditionally, it was believed that making khapse could predict success for the upcoming year,\" explained Dolma. For example, oil spilling during the frying process was considered a bad omen. Jampa recalled an accident from his childhood that ruined his family's New Year celebrations. \"[It meant] evil,\" he said, noting how preparing the snack is steeped in cultural beliefs.\nKhapse recipes and the shapes the snack takes vary across regions and families. In Tibet's Markam County, where Jampa grew up, khapse was traditionally sweetened with organic honey from their beehives instead of sugar. Khapse made with honey \"makes the biscuit a little softer\", he explained. \"The sweetness of honey-made khapse arrives more slowly.\" In contrast, recipes that call for sugar have a crunchier texture.\n\"Different parts of Tibet mould khapse differently [and] in different shapes,\" Jampa said. \"I am from Kham. In my village, we make less ornate\u00a0khapse, known as\u00a0kong-chen \u2013 a narrow rectangular piece of dough with a cut in the middle through which one side of the\u00a0khapse\u00a0is pulled through.\" Another style, the hrug-hrug, \"are basically just small rectangles or triangles of dough that require no further work\", Jampa explained.\nKhapse is also deeply connected to Buddhist rituals. During Losar, flowers, fruits, grains, nuts, salt, butter and water are placed on the altar, as offerings to deities, alongside stacks of khapse arranged in towers called derga.\n\"Derga khapses are different shapes, compared to the khapses that we eat,\" my Tibetan friend, Tenzin Diki, told me. \"We add khapse in the shape of a crescent moon and a sun on the derga. We also add beautiful kharu (smaller, ornately designed pieces of khapse) on the derga, and decorate it with chhurpi [traditional cheese], sweets [and] rock sugar.\"\nToday, these fried cookies have evolved in style and shape and are eaten throughout the year. Khapse is sold year-round at stores in Kathmandu and many families prepare it as a snack outside of Losar. A quick online search for \"khapse\" or \"khapsey\" shows legions of home chefs and food bloggers experimenting with moulding the cookies and preparing them with additional ingredients like banana, beetroot, spinach and more.\n\"These days, people have modernised khapse, using their creativity, adding motifs to shape it differently,\" Sherpa explained. \"The shapes now depend on how much creativity one has. You can make it in any shape you want.\"\nYet, not everyone embraces these innovations. \"We have to keep traditional things traditional,\" said Jampa. \"[Khapse] is a special ceremony snack, a symbol of family effort and [it] reminds us that it is something special.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From Nubian Markets to the National Center for Afro-American Artists, a local tour guide offers his picks for the best places to see Boston's Black culture\nBoston is a city of neighbourhoods, and if you wander off the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail that passes through 16 significant sites in US history, you'll find extraordinary stories tucked in every nook and corner. Getting visitors to explore the city's varied cultural districts has long been a goal of Collin Knight, who founded Live Like a Local Tours in 2019. As a native of Roxbury, the neighbourhood that's the beating heart of Boston's Black community, he's working to highlight the city's rich African American culture while also acknowledging Boston's history of racial tensions.\u00a0\nThough Boston is perhaps most famous for its strong Irish roots, the city's Black history runs deep. Prior to the US Civil War, Boston was one of the most important stops on the Underground Railroad. The first chartered branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People civil rights organisation was founded here in 1911. Malcolm X moved to Boston 30 years later, followed by Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who considered the city his \"second home\" and fell in love with his would-be wife, Coretta Scott King, here. Today, 25 percent of Boston's population is Black \u2013 twice the percentage of the Black population in the US.\u00a0\n\"When we look at downtown, the city's Eurocentric history is being glorified each and every day. They're not really talking about Native Americans and African Americans and their plight within this country and Boston's connection to slavery,\" Knight says. \"I'm trying to figure out how we can tell the whole history of Massachusetts in the city of Boston instead of just telling one part.\"\u00a0\nHere are Knight's suggestions of the five best places in Boston to experience the city's vibrant modern-day Black culture, as well as the ties to its past.\n1.\u00a0The National Center for Afro-American Artists\u00a0\n\"The National Center for Afro-American Artists (NCAAA) houses art from some of the most prominent African American artists that have lived in the Boston area or are from the Boston area. A lot of people don't know much about it,\" Knight says. \"Dr Barry Gaither has been the curator of that museum since 1968. It was created by Dr Elma Lewis, who was the grande dame of the arts within the Boston area for many years. She was very well known for providing arts and culture to young people of colour within Boston, and Roxbury specifically.\"\u00a0\nKnight's must-see experiences within the museum include seeing the narrative paintings of Roxbury legend Allan Crite, known as the \"Dean of African American artists\" in New England, thanks to his nearly 90-year career. Another highlight, says Knight, is the ASPELTA exhibit displaying artefacts from Nubia. The exhibit features scores of 2,600-year-old objects recovered by archaeologists from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard University, including a fully-accurate recreation of the interior of a Nubian tomb. \"It's pretty incredible,\" Knight says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://ncaaa.org/\nAddress: 300 Walnut Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-442-8614\nFacebook:@themuseum_ncaaa\n\n2. Nubian Markets\u00a0\nThis sprawling new grocery store, halal butcher shop and fast-casual cafe, which opened in Roxbury in spring 2023, celebrates the food of the African diaspora. Its shelves are stocked with hard-to-find produce and vegetable items, and more than 30 Black-owned brands. \"It's absolutely incredible when you think about it: the halal approach, the restaurant/supermarket approach and the fact that it's a Black-owned supermarket in the middle of Roxbury,\" Knight says, noting that, historically, most grocery stores in the neighbourhood had been white-owned or run by white conglomerates.\u00a0\n\"This is a very powerful thing for us as Black people,\" Knight added. \"It's not something that we've ever had in our own community\u2026 They are focused on supporting other local businesses and other vendors of colour across the country.\"\nCuts of lamb, beef, and goat sold at the shop are raised following Islamic standards to feed the city\u2019s growing Muslim population, and many products on its shelves, sauces and spice mixes, are produced by local artisans like Cameroon native Paulette Ngachoko, founder of Hapi African Gourmet. In the cafe, menu items range from ginger beef and injera bowls to pea fritters and lamb couscous. \"I'm just excited about everything they're doing,\" Knight says.\nWebsite: https://www.nubianmarkets.com/\nAddress: 2565 Washington Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-608-4940\nInstagram: @nubianmarkets\n3. Comfort Kitchen\nThis cosy Black-, immigrant- and woman-owned restaurant opened in January 2023 in Dorchester's Uphams Corner neighbourhood. It was nearly a decade in the making and comes with its own dose of history: it's housed inside a 1912-built building that is on the National Register of Historic Places.\u00a0\n\"I love the owners over there. You think about the vibe that's in there, you think about the menu and how it's connected to the African diaspora,\" Knight says. \"[The building] was a comfort station [public restroom] for people travelling from the Dorchester area to the South Shore.\"\u00a0\nInside the former bathroom, the chic 30-seat space has curved pale-pink banquettes that are an Instagram favourite. Cocktails feature Equiano, an Afro-Caribbean rum produced in Mauritius and Barbados, or pay tribute to Black engineering pioneer Lewis Latimer, who worked alongside Alexander Graham Bell to develop the telephone in Boston in the 1880s. (Non-alcoholic drinks include a take on Tootsie, a Ghanaian fermented beer or a baobab mocktail.) For dinner, munch on jackfruit sliders, jerk roasted duck or za'atar brown butter trout.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.comfortkitchenbos.com/\nAddress: 611 Columbia Road, Dorchester\nPhone: 1-617-329-6010\nInstagram: @comfortkitchenbos\n4. Wally's Cafe and Jazz Club\u00a0\nWally's is an institution in Boston's South End neighbourhood, and when founder Joseph Walcott opened the club in 1947, he was the first African American nightclub owner in New England. Walcott got his start by drawing \u2013 and often driving \u2013 musicians up from New York City and created one of the few spaces in Boston during the time of segregation where anyone of any race could mingle. Today his grandchildren run the space, which hosts music 365 nights a year, often drawing from talented students at Berklee School of Music, the New England Conservatory and other nearby institutions. It's considered the oldest jazz club in the city.\u00a0\n\"What most people don't realise is there were jazz joints and juke joints up and down Massachusetts Avenue. That is the last of a dying breed that we had all over [the area] back in the day.\u00a0All of the greats came to play,\" says Knight \u2013 among them Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday. Check the schedule for their funk, jazz, and salsa offerings, which run from 17:00 to 01:00 nightly.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://wallyscafe.com/\nAddress: 427 Massachusetts Ave., South End\nPhone: 1-617-828-1754\nInstagram: @wallyscafejazzclub\n5. The Embrace\u00a0\nThis new, massive bronze sculpture was unveiled on Boston Common this year, celebrating Boston's civil rights legacy and commemorating the period that Dr Martin Luther King Jr lived in Boston. King attended theology school at Boston University in the 1950s and met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who was attending the New England Conservatory of Music, while living in the city.\nThe sculpture, by artist Hank Willis Thomas, is an abstract depiction based on a photo of the couple embracing after King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. It also recognises a moment in April 1965 when the leader stood on the park before a crowd of 22,000 and called for Boston to live up to its ideals and create a more equitable city.\u00a0\nWhile the sculpture alone \"is a really beautiful piece to tell that history, I think, more importantly, if you look at the grounds of The Embrace, you see all of these names [of people who marched alongside King and helped expand his ideas],\" Knight says. \"It's really about all of the local community advocates that have made a difference within the Roxbury community and the Boston community at large. So, I think it's an incredible tribute to Dr Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King, but it's also a tribute to our city as a whole, to talk about the Black histories of our city, of our neighbourhoods, and have it be in the middle of the Boston Common.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.embraceboston.org/memorial\nAddress: Boston Common, 139 Tremont Street\nInstagram: @embracebos\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published on 17 June 2023 and has been updated, including the removal of one business which has since closed, Soleil restaurant.\n---\u00a0\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u00a0called \"The Essential List\".

        "article_text": "From Captain America: Brave New World to Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, these are the films to stream and watch at the cinema this month.\nThere are plenty of films about The Beatles, but Becoming Led Zeppelin is the first ever authorised documentary about the band that took over their mantle as one of the world's biggest and most influential rock groups. An intimate account of the foursome's pre-Zep careers and their early years together, the film is constructed from jovial interviews with the three surviving members, singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones, while a 1971 interview with John Bonham provides the late drummer's perspective. \"It's the personal confidences that stand out\" in this \"fascinating\" film, says Jonathan Romney in Uncut. \"A rich vein of anecdotes is found in Page and Jones's busy history as session players, with Jones particularly emerging as an affable raconteur with a juicy portfolio of anecdotes.\" James Bond trivia alert: as jobbing musicians, both Page and Jones were in Abbey Road Studios when Shirley Bassey recorded the theme song for Goldfinger.\nReleased on 5 February in the UK and Ireland, and on 7 February in the US, Canada, Australian, Spain and Sweden\nArmand is a provocative and weirdly comic Norwegian drama written and directed by Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, the grandson of two Scandinavian film legends, Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann. Renate Reinsve, the star of The Worst Person in the World, plays a famous actress who is summoned to her six-year-old son's school after he has been accused of sexually assaulting a classmate. Ushered into a room with the school's senior teachers and the alleged victim's parents, she is subjected to \"one of the most harrowing PT meetings ever witnessed\", says Jo-Ann Titmarsh in HeyUGuys. And as secret connections and shady agendas emerge, \"there is plenty of violence lurking beneath the surface of this middle-class tale\". The winner of the prize for best first feature film at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Armand is \"troubling, entertaining and at times confounding\".\nReleased on 7 February in the US, on 21 February in Spain, and on 28 February in Turkey\nI'm Still Here is already one of the stand-out successes of this year's awards season, having been nominated for the best picture, best international feature, and best actress Oscars. A Brazilian political thriller directed by Walter Salles (Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries), it tells the true story of Rubens and Eunice Paiva and their children. In 1971, they are living happily by the beach in Rio de Janeiro, but Rubens (Selton Mello), a former congressman, has been campaigning against the military dictatorship. When he is removed from his house by a team of policemen, it is up to his wife (the Oscar-nominated Fernanda Torres) to ask where he has been taken \u2013 and to keep asking, even when all hope seems lost. A longstanding family friend of the Paivas, Salles has made a \"deeply poignant\" drama, says Jessica Kiang in Variety, and his \"deeply invested film-making is remarkable in its grace and naturalism\".\nReleased on 14 February in the US, and on 21 February in the UK, Ireland and Spain\nThe classic Looney Tunes characters have featured in some of the greatest animated short films ever made, but they haven't been in any feature-length cartoons: instead, they've popped up in such animated/ live-action hybrids as Space Jam and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. But now, at last, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig star in their own 91-minute animation, a full nine decades after the characters made their debuts. The idea is that Daffy and Porky (both voiced by Eric Bauza) get a job in a bubblegum factory where they uncover an alien plot to take over the world. \"It's not consistently hilarious but it is consistently imaginative, sometimes even breathtaking,\" says William Bibbiani in The Wrap. \"The animation style evokes favourable comparisons to Max Fleischer and Don Bluth, with jaw-dropping backgrounds and fluid, energetic, expressive movement. It's the prettiest animated movie Warner Bros has released since The Iron Giant.\"\nReleased on 12 February in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and on 28 February in the US and India\nInspired by a Stephen King short story, The Monkey stars Theo James as a pair of twin brothers with a cursed wind-up toy monkey: ever since they were children, the toy has somehow caused people to die in extravagantly gory ways. The film is written and directed by Osgood Perkins, who made last year's creepy horror hit, Longlegs, but he promises that his follow-up is completely different. While Longlegs was infused with a gloomy atmosphere of dread and despair, The Monkey revels in the silliness of its premise. \"It's deliberately comedic,\" Perkins said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's feeling more like an old John Landis movie or a Joe Dante movie or a Robert Zemeckis movie. I saw an opportunity to make a wry, absurdist comedy about death... For me, the movie is a smile from top to bottom.\"\nReleased on 21 February in cinemas internationally\nIt's been 24 years since the first Bridget Jones film, and over eight years since the last one, but Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is back again in the fourth comedy to be based on Helen Fielding's bestselling novels. This time Bridget is a single mother dealing with the death of her husband, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth \u2013 who is due to appear in flashbacks). Leo Woodall (One Day) plays her much-younger love interest, Chiwetel Ejiofor is an eligible teacher at her children's school, and Hugh Grant has a cameo as her dastardly former boss, Daniel Cleaver. But will audiences still warm to the bumbling Bridget? Zellweger believes so. \"I think maybe folks recognise themselves in her and relate to her struggles and feelings of self-doubt,\" she said in British Vogue. \"Bridget is authentically herself and doesn't always get it right, but whatever her imperfections, she remains joyful and optimistic, carries on and triumphs in her own way. She seems to make her quirky individuality and shortcomings charming, lovable and acceptable \u2013 and, in turn, she makes us feel lovable and acceptable, too.\"\nReleased on 12, 13 and 14 February in cinemas internationally, and on 13 February on Peacock in the US\nAs a boy in the 1980s, Ke Huy Quan had major roles in two blockbusters, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Goonies, but acting work dried up soon afterwards. Decades on, he made a stunning comeback in the multiverse-spanning Everything Everywhere All at Once, and even won an Oscar for best supporting actor. Now he has his first ever leading role. Love Hurts is an action comedy in which Quan plays a geeky estate agent with a secret past as a gangland enforcer. The film's mix of gentle humour and nifty martial artistry seems ideal for him, but he wasn't sure whether to take the role until he consulted an old friend. \"I was at an event with Steven Spielberg and he was asking me, \u2018Ke, how are you doing?'\" Quan told Empire magazine. \"I said, 'Steven, I'm not doing so well.' Because of all the love and support that I had gotten during that whole award season, I was so worried that whatever I was going to do next, I would disappoint. I told him about this project and kind of pitched it to him. He said, 'Ke, it's great. Do it.'\"\nReleased on 7 February in cinemas internationally\nNow that Chris Evans is no longer playing Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the question is whether audiences will pay to see someone else wielding the character's patented red, white and blue shield. More specifically, will audiences pay to see Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson, who was Captain America's sidekick in earlier Marvel films, and has now been promoted to the title role? Judging by the trailers and the posters, studio executives seem to be hoping that another character will be the film's big draw. Filling in for the late William Hurt, Harrison Ford co-stars as Thaddeus Ross, a former US Army general \u2013 and arch-enemy of the Hulk \u2013 who has just been elected as US president. He hopes to count on the new Captain America's support, but their negotiations are interrupted when Ross is transformed into a bright red version of The Hulk. \"What we liked was this notion of a man who is trying to do the best he can but can't quite outrun the demons of his past,\" the film's producer, Nate Moore, told Entertainment Weekly. \"Turning a guy who hunted Hulks into a Hulk himself makes him more than an antagonist; it makes him a tragic character.\"\nReleased on 14 February in cinemas internationally\nA genre-mashing horror-romance-action film, The Gorge is directed by Scott Derrickson (Doctor Strange, The Black Phone), and it stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller. The concept, as dreamt up by screenwriter Zach Dean, is that two elite snipers are paid to spend a year in separate concrete observation towers on either side of a remote, misty valley. They have no high-tech means of communicating with each other, but they chat and flirt via flashcards and binoculars. The only obstacle in the way of this burgeoning relationship is that the valley is, apparently, \"the door to hell\", and their job is to stop monsters climbing out of it. The Gorge is a Valentine's Day release, and Teller thinks that it's the perfect film for the occasion, whether or not you're in the mood for love. \"Well, I just think it's good alternative programming, as well, to your typical love story,\" he told Screen Rant. \"They meet each other for the first time, and you're going to watch 'em fall in love. But they have to go through some really entertaining, engaging, high-octane, hellacious shit to end up with each other, so that's cool.\"\nReleased on 14 February on Apple TV+\nChristopher Andrews' debut film as writer-director could be the darkest and most brutal thriller about sheep-farming ever made. At its heart are two dysfunctional families with adjacent fields in the rural west of Ireland.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump says that wind farms harm birds and whales. Scientists weigh wind power's impacts on wildlife against those of oil and gas.\nAspen Ellis, a seabird biologist at University of California, Santa Cruz, spent a decade doing field work on remote islands off the coast of the United States. She often lived for months amongst thousands of birds, becoming so immersed in their ways that she even learned to tell which predators were nearby from the birds' calls. But as she added her observations to 40 or 50 years of previous research on these colonies, she noticed a worrying pattern.\n\"Again and again, I just found myself logging the impact of climate change over time,\" she recalls, from rising sea levels that threatened breeding colonies, to fish moving to cooler areas and leaving seabird chicks starving. \"Without addressing this larger issue of climate change, the seabird conversation work we were doing wasn't sufficient to save those populations,\" she adds. She decided to change focus \u2013 and today, studies ways to make clean-energy offshore wind farms safer for birds.\nThe impact of energy production on wildlife has come into the spotlight again amid US President Donald Trump's plan to pivot the country's supply from renewables such as wind, to oil and gas. In his first days in office, Trump revoked former-president Joe Biden's ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling. \"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump promised when he was inaugurated, while putting the brakes on the expansion of wind farms. One of his arguments is that wind farms harm birds and whales. His executive order halting offshore wind farm development cited the importance of marine life as one of the reasons for the decision.\nRenewables beyond the US\nThe US energy policy pivot towards fossil fuels is halting wind power developments for now, even as other nations press ahead with the expansion. China, for example, is home to almost two-thirds of the world's solar and wind power projects in construction.\nAfter China, the UK is the world's next-largest offshore wind market. Scotland's government has described wind power expansion as a \"once in a generation economic opportunity\", with a pipeline of around 40GW of offshore wind capacity in addition to 3GW already in Scottish waters.\nMeanwhile, the fastest-growing renewables sector of any major economy belongs to India. And in almost every country worldwide, wind and solar remain the cheapest way to add new power.\nWhile wind farms can have some adverse effects on local wildlife in the habitats where they are sited, including through noise, Ellis and other scientists specialising in the environmental impact of wind farms challenge the claim that wind power is more damaging to wildlife than fossil fuel extraction. They describe wind energy as a powerful and necessary weapon against climate change, arguing that its impact on wildlife can be understood, managed and reduced. They contrast this with the existential risk posed by fossil fuels driving global warming \u2013 along with the ongoing noise and pollution from oil and gas production.\nThe debate is highlighting one of the most challenging conundrums facing renewable energy projects around the world \u2013 to what degree must they balance the impact they can have on local environments with the global effects of climate change? And how do those wind-power related impacts compare with the local effects of oil and gas drilling?\n\"Fossil fuels, and their effect on climate change, outweigh everything,\" says Beth Scott, a professor in marine ecology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, a nation that has become a wind energy powerhouse. \"Climate change is by far, by far the worst enemy, to all wildlife, and humans.\" Speaking from Aberdeen, she points to her window, at a brewing storm due to batter Scotland later in the day. It's too soon to say if this particular storm has been made stronger by climate change, but the overall picture is clear \u2013 extreme weather is \"only going to get worse\" in a warmer world, she says.\nScott and her colleagues are studying the impact of wind power on the marine ecosystem. While that impact exists \u2013 more on it later \u2013 she also describes wind power especially useful tool in the switch to renewable, climate-friendly energy because it can be built quickly and at scale.\n\"Once you start construction, in less than two years, you can build a 2GW [offshore wind] farm \u2013 the equivalent of a nuclear plant,\" Scott says. Nuclear power plants can take over a decade to construct. \"So, in terms of rapid response to climate change, there's that.\"\nEllis also sees wind power as especially promising. \"There is a lot of consensus [among seabird experts] on the need to move from traditional energy sources to a renewable energy framework, and offshore wind has a really big potential to do that,\" she says. \"We're seeing the industry really boom very quickly, there's a lot of interest in that internationally, there's a lot of capacity for it internationally.\"\nWind farms, both on land and in the sea, do pose a risk to birds, however, including habitat loss and collisions with the turbine or their blades. In Scotland, for example, the northern gannet and the black-legged kittiwake are considered at high risk of collision with wind farms.\u00a0\nSeabirds may also suffer indirect effects, for example if they change their routes to avoid wind farms, and then spend more time and energy finding food. How much seabirds avoid wind farms, and how this affects them, may vary significantly and is still subject to ongoing research. Some, such as the red-throated diver, have been reported to avoid wind farms, while others, such as large gulls, have a mixed response to them, research suggests. Others again, such as cormorants, seek out wind farms to forage and roost there. (Read more about how wind farms can be made safer for birds.)\nIn Scotland, Scott and other scientists are conducting wide-ranging research on the impact of wind farms on the whole food web, including on plankton, using ocean robots and other instruments. Wind power does alter the ecosystem, Scott says, but the impact is not necessarily always negative. Research tracking seals suggests that they now use wind farms as hunting grounds to forage for fish gathering around the turbines, for example, with one seal's tracks showing how the animal made its way through the farm and stopped at different turbines to snack.\nDecades of research from around the world suggests that oil production affects birds, whales and other wildlife in many different ways. Apart from the climate factor, there is the risk of oil spills as well as smaller, chronic leaks, scientists say, which can harm seabirds, whales, dolphins and other wildlife. Dolphins exposed to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for example, suffered health problems including chronic lung disease and abnormal hearts, research has shown.\nKaitlin Frasier, an associate research scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego, and other researchers have studied how the unprecedentedly large and deep offshore oil spill has impacted different whale and dolphin species in the long term. They used acoustic sensors to record the clicks emitted by the animals, and from that, estimated their population density in the area. They found that a decade after the spill, seven of eight monitored species groups had declined, including sperm whales (by up to 31%) and beaked whales (up to 83%).\nBut the sensors also picked up on something else, which you can listen to in the recording below: deafening blasts from oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\"[The Gulf of Mexico] is a really noisy area because of all of the surveys that are associated with drilling, they do these seismic surveys that generate a whole lot of noise as they are looking for the oil pockets and understanding how the oil is moving,\" says Frasier.\nThe noise from oil and gas is largely from seismic surveys deploying airguns, which are towed behind ships and blast compressed air through the water every 10 seconds, Frasier says. \"They're doing this in deep water, 1,000m (3,280ft) or more, and it's really low frequencies, so theses sound waves travel really far in deep water,\" she says. The sound is so powerful that \"you can hear it all the way across the Gulf of Mexico\".\n\"So, they're surveying off of Texas, you'll hear it off of Florida, you'll hear it in Mexican waters. There's no way to escape that sound,\" she says.\nFor whales, dolphins and other marine mammals that rely on sound and echolocation to find their food in dark and murky water, such loud and sudden underwater noise can be deeply disorienting, equivalent to being blinded, as well as being very distressing for them, research has shown.\n\"If you think about a sperm whale, one of the species in our study, a third of the body of the animal is a sound-production device. That's how important sound is to the animal. Their whole life is centred around the use of sound,\" says Frasier.\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, the noise from the airguns as well as vessels may be making it harder for whales and dolphins to forage for food, Frasier suggests. The oil and gas industry, however, maintains that there is no evidence that airgun noise injures or harms marine life, an assertion that environmental groups dispute.\n\"It's not that we think those sounds are directly killing whales, but those whales use sound in their daily life to find food, to communicate with each other,\" Frasier says. \"Imagine if a light was being blasted into your face every 10 seconds \u2013 that would be disruptive as you're trying to go about your day.\"\u00a0\nWind farm construction also involves noise, for example during surveying but also when the pile is hammered into the seabed. Studies have shown that seals and harbour porpoises are affected by the noise from pile-driving, causing them to flee for several miles and affecting their ability to feed.\nBut Frasier highlights that with oil and gas, the surveys happen over a longer time period, not just before but also during extraction.\n\"We see it in all of our recordings,\" she says of the oil-related noise, which she describes as a constant backdrop to the whale sounds. \"It's very heart-wrenching to listen to.\"\nBy comparison, evidence from European offshore wind farms suggests that loud noise from wind farm construction tends to be more temporary and containable, as it happens during the pile-driving phase. In Europe, some countries such as Germany now legally oblige offshore wind farm developers to place devices called bubble curtains around the construction sites to buffer such pile-driving noise, and protect porpoises and other marine animals. (Read about how bubble curtains work, and their effect on wind farm noise).\nOnce the wind farm is in place, it can keep spinning for decades and then be replaced with new turbines on the same land, whereas oil production moves on once one site is exhausted. There is, however, also ongoing noise in offshore wind farms from the spinning turbines and the supply and maintenance vessels. Ship noise \u2013 whether from such maintenance vessels, or shipping generally \u2013 can in turn affect marine mammals such as harbour porpoises.\nLiba Pejchar, a professor and conservation biologist at Colorado State University, and her team have compared the effects of inland wind energy and oil and gas on ecosystems in Colorado and neighbouring Wyoming. These states are home to wind farms, as well as oil and gas fields. One of the aspects they studied was habitat loss and fragmentation, meaning, wildlife habitat being lost or broken up through roads as well as the turbines or oil and gas fields themselves.\nThey found that both onshore wind farms and oil and gas production, caused habitat loss. However, \"we found overall that wind energy resulted in less habitat fragmentation than oil and gas and especially, less impacts over the long term\", she says. \"In the near term, the impacts were often somewhat equivalent, but wind energy is a renewable resource, so once you put in the turbines, they continue to harness that energy for decades to come. Whereas oil and gas have to keep moving, and so those impacts just getting compounded across the landscape.\"\nWhile wind power hazards for birds, such as collisions, are well-known, preliminary research by Pejchar's team suggests oil and gas production can also negatively affect birds and their habitat, and for example, have impacted ferruginous hawks in Wyoming.\nLike the other scientists, Pejchar also highlights how climate change, driven by fossil fuels, is already changing the environment. \"There's a higher frequency of these large, catastrophic fires in Colorado in particular,\" she says. \"Sometimes wildlife can benefit from fire, it's a natural form of disturbance, but the scale of these fires and the intensity and frequency \u2013 there could be complete state changes, where forests can no longer be sustained because fire is moving through them on such a regular basis. So that's going to have a huge impact on wildlife communities.\"\nBoth industries are taking steps to reduce the effect their activities have on the local environments where they operate.\nIn a 2022 study co-led by Ellis, an international group of scientists and also conservation organisations such as American Bird Conservancy developed a process that allows wind farm developers to identify and minimise the risks to seabirds. They recommended measures to reduce or offset the impact that included choosing sites that are less in the way of seabirds' known flight routes or habitats; wind farm developers building alternative nesting sites; and developers funding conservation programmes to boost the species in other habitats.\u00a0\n\"Seabirds are a great case study for this [process], because we have a lot of data about many of these species,\" Ellis says. In addition, \"seabird conservation is very well understood\", she says, both in terms of specific threats to seabirds, such as predators and invasive plants, and also in terms of how to effectively address those threats, for example by removing predators such as rats, and clearing invasive plants. The assessment process outlined in the study could then also be used to reduce the impact of wind power on other species, such as bats and whales, with measures that are appropriate for them, she says.\nRegarding the environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction, some of the most important measures have aimed at reducing oil spills and chronic oil pollution, which can be catastrophic for birds and other wildlife. Monitoring of beached, oiled birds in Europe's North Sea has revealed a sharp decline in the rate of oiled birds, suggesting a decrease in oil pollution and spills as a result of measures such as requiring oil tankers to have double hulls.\nBut the attempts to lessen the local effects of energy infrastructure do little to address the wider context of climate change, the threat of which has led to international agreements to phase down fossil fuels. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are leading many parts of the world to feel the effects of global warming.\nAnd these are beginning to affect the environments where fossil fuels are extracted too.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump says that wind farms harm birds and whales. Scientists weigh wind power's impacts on wildlife against those of oil and gas.\nAspen Ellis, a seabird biologist at University of California, Santa Cruz, spent a decade doing field work on remote islands off the coast of the United States. She often lived for months amongst thousands of birds, becoming so immersed in their ways that she even learned to tell which predators were nearby from the birds' calls. But as she added her observations to 40 or 50 years of previous research on these colonies, she noticed a worrying pattern.\n\"Again and again, I just found myself logging the impact of climate change over time,\" she recalls, from rising sea levels that threatened breeding colonies, to fish moving to cooler areas and leaving seabird chicks starving. \"Without addressing this larger issue of climate change, the seabird conversation work we were doing wasn't sufficient to save those populations,\" she adds. She decided to change focus \u2013 and today, studies ways to make clean-energy offshore wind farms safer for birds.\nThe impact of energy production on wildlife has come into the spotlight again amid US President Donald Trump's plan to pivot the country's supply from renewables such as wind, to oil and gas. In his first days in office, Trump revoked former-president Joe Biden's ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling. \"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump promised when he was inaugurated, while putting the brakes on the expansion of wind farms. One of his arguments is that wind farms harm birds and whales. His executive order halting offshore wind farm development cited the importance of marine life as one of the reasons for the decision.\nRenewables beyond the US\nThe US energy policy pivot towards fossil fuels is halting wind power developments for now, even as other nations press ahead with the expansion. China, for example, is home to almost two-thirds of the world's solar and wind power projects in construction.\nAfter China, the UK is the world's next-largest offshore wind market. Scotland's government has described wind power expansion as a \"once in a generation economic opportunity\", with a pipeline of around 40GW of offshore wind capacity in addition to 3GW already in Scottish waters.\nMeanwhile, the fastest-growing renewables sector of any major economy belongs to India. And in almost every country worldwide, wind and solar remain the cheapest way to add new power.\nWhile wind farms can have some adverse effects on local wildlife in the habitats where they are sited, including through noise, Ellis and other scientists specialising in the environmental impact of wind farms challenge the claim that wind power is more damaging to wildlife than fossil fuel extraction. They describe wind energy as a powerful and necessary weapon against climate change, arguing that its impact on wildlife can be understood, managed and reduced. They contrast this with the existential risk posed by fossil fuels driving global warming \u2013 along with the ongoing noise and pollution from oil and gas production.\nThe debate is highlighting one of the most challenging conundrums facing renewable energy projects around the world \u2013 to what degree must they balance the impact they can have on local environments with the global effects of climate change? And how do those wind-power related impacts compare with the local effects of oil and gas drilling?\n\"Fossil fuels, and their effect on climate change, outweigh everything,\" says Beth Scott, a professor in marine ecology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, a nation that has become a wind energy powerhouse. \"Climate change is by far, by far the worst enemy, to all wildlife, and humans.\" Speaking from Aberdeen, she points to her window, at a brewing storm due to batter Scotland later in the day. It's too soon to say if this particular storm has been made stronger by climate change, but the overall picture is clear \u2013 extreme weather is \"only going to get worse\" in a warmer world, she says.\nScott and her colleagues are studying the impact of wind power on the marine ecosystem. While that impact exists \u2013 more on it later \u2013 she also describes wind power especially useful tool in the switch to renewable, climate-friendly energy because it can be built quickly and at scale.\n\"Once you start construction, in less than two years, you can build a 2GW [offshore wind] farm \u2013 the equivalent of a nuclear plant,\" Scott says. Nuclear power plants can take over a decade to construct. \"So, in terms of rapid response to climate change, there's that.\"\nEllis also sees wind power as especially promising. \"There is a lot of consensus [among seabird experts] on the need to move from traditional energy sources to a renewable energy framework, and offshore wind has a really big potential to do that,\" she says. \"We're seeing the industry really boom very quickly, there's a lot of interest in that internationally, there's a lot of capacity for it internationally.\"\nWind farms, both on land and in the sea, do pose a risk to birds, however, including habitat loss and collisions with the turbine or their blades. In Scotland, for example, the northern gannet and the black-legged kittiwake are considered at high risk of collision with wind farms.\u00a0\nSeabirds may also suffer indirect effects, for example if they change their routes to avoid wind farms, and then spend more time and energy finding food. How much seabirds avoid wind farms, and how this affects them, may vary significantly and is still subject to ongoing research. Some, such as the red-throated diver, have been reported to avoid wind farms, while others, such as large gulls, have a mixed response to them, research suggests. Others again, such as cormorants, seek out wind farms to forage and roost there. (Read more about how wind farms can be made safer for birds.)\nIn Scotland, Scott and other scientists are conducting wide-ranging research on the impact of wind farms on the whole food web, including on plankton, using ocean robots and other instruments. Wind power does alter the ecosystem, Scott says, but the impact is not necessarily always negative. Research tracking seals suggests that they now use wind farms as hunting grounds to forage for fish gathering around the turbines, for example, with one seal's tracks showing how the animal made its way through the farm and stopped at different turbines to snack.\nDecades of research from around the world suggests that oil production affects birds, whales and other wildlife in many different ways. Apart from the climate factor, there is the risk of oil spills as well as smaller, chronic leaks, scientists say, which can harm seabirds, whales, dolphins and other wildlife. Dolphins exposed to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for example, suffered health problems including chronic lung disease and abnormal hearts, research has shown.\nKaitlin Frasier, an associate research scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego, and other researchers have studied how the unprecedentedly large and deep offshore oil spill has impacted different whale and dolphin species in the long term. They used acoustic sensors to record the clicks emitted by the animals, and from that, estimated their population density in the area. They found that a decade after the spill, seven of eight monitored species groups had declined, including sperm whales (by up to 31%) and beaked whales (up to 83%).\nBut the sensors also picked up on something else, which you can listen to in the recording below: deafening blasts from oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\"[The Gulf of Mexico] is a really noisy area because of all of the surveys that are associated with drilling, they do these seismic surveys that generate a whole lot of noise as they are looking for the oil pockets and understanding how the oil is moving,\" says Frasier.\nThe noise from oil and gas is largely from seismic surveys deploying airguns, which are towed behind ships and blast compressed air through the water every 10 seconds, Frasier says. \"They're doing this in deep water, 1,000m (3,280ft) or more, and it's really low frequencies, so theses sound waves travel really far in deep water,\" she says. The sound is so powerful that \"you can hear it all the way across the Gulf of Mexico\".\n\"So, they're surveying off of Texas, you'll hear it off of Florida, you'll hear it in Mexican waters. There's no way to escape that sound,\" she says.\nFor whales, dolphins and other marine mammals that rely on sound and echolocation to find their food in dark and murky water, such loud and sudden underwater noise can be deeply disorienting, equivalent to being blinded, as well as being very distressing for them, research has shown.\n\"If you think about a sperm whale, one of the species in our study, a third of the body of the animal is a sound-production device. That's how important sound is to the animal. Their whole life is centred around the use of sound,\" says Frasier.\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, the noise from the airguns as well as vessels may be making it harder for whales and dolphins to forage for food, Frasier suggests. The oil and gas industry, however, maintains that there is no evidence that airgun noise injures or harms marine life, an assertion that environmental groups dispute.\n\"It's not that we think those sounds are directly killing whales, but those whales use sound in their daily life to find food, to communicate with each other,\" Frasier says. \"Imagine if a light was being blasted into your face every 10 seconds \u2013 that would be disruptive as you're trying to go about your day.\"\u00a0\nWind farm construction also involves noise, for example during surveying but also when the pile is hammered into the seabed. Studies have shown that seals and harbour porpoises are affected by the noise from pile-driving, causing them to flee for several miles and affecting their ability to feed.\nBut Frasier highlights that with oil and gas, the surveys happen over a longer time period, not just before but also during extraction.\n\"We see it in all of our recordings,\" she says of the oil-related noise, which she describes as a constant backdrop to the whale sounds. \"It's very heart-wrenching to listen to.\"\nBy comparison, evidence from European offshore wind farms suggests that loud noise from wind farm construction tends to be more temporary and containable, as it happens during the pile-driving phase. In Europe, some countries such as Germany now legally oblige offshore wind farm developers to place devices called bubble curtains around the construction sites to buffer such pile-driving noise, and protect porpoises and other marine animals. (Read about how bubble curtains work, and their effect on wind farm noise).\nOnce the wind farm is in place, it can keep spinning for decades and then be replaced with new turbines on the same land, whereas oil production moves on once one site is exhausted. There is, however, also ongoing noise in offshore wind farms from the spinning turbines and the supply and maintenance vessels. Ship noise \u2013 whether from such maintenance vessels, or shipping generally \u2013 can in turn affect marine mammals such as harbour porpoises.\nLiba Pejchar, a professor and conservation biologist at Colorado State University, and her team have compared the effects of inland wind energy and oil and gas on ecosystems in Colorado and neighbouring Wyoming. These states are home to wind farms, as well as oil and gas fields. One of the aspects they studied was habitat loss and fragmentation, meaning, wildlife habitat being lost or broken up through roads as well as the turbines or oil and gas fields themselves.\nThey found that both onshore wind farms and oil and gas production, caused habitat loss. However, \"we found overall that wind energy resulted in less habitat fragmentation than oil and gas and especially, less impacts over the long term\", she says. \"In the near term, the impacts were often somewhat equivalent, but wind energy is a renewable resource, so once you put in the turbines, they continue to harness that energy for decades to come. Whereas oil and gas have to keep moving, and so those impacts just getting compounded across the landscape.\"\nWhile wind power hazards for birds, such as collisions, are well-known, preliminary research by Pejchar's team suggests oil and gas production can also negatively affect birds and their habitat, and for example, have impacted ferruginous hawks in Wyoming.\nLike the other scientists, Pejchar also highlights how climate change, driven by fossil fuels, is already changing the environment. \"There's a higher frequency of these large, catastrophic fires in Colorado in particular,\" she says. \"Sometimes wildlife can benefit from fire, it's a natural form of disturbance, but the scale of these fires and the intensity and frequency \u2013 there could be complete state changes, where forests can no longer be sustained because fire is moving through them on such a regular basis. So that's going to have a huge impact on wildlife communities.\"\nBoth industries are taking steps to reduce the effect their activities have on the local environments where they operate.\nIn a 2022 study co-led by Ellis, an international group of scientists and also conservation organisations such as American Bird Conservancy developed a process that allows wind farm developers to identify and minimise the risks to seabirds. They recommended measures to reduce or offset the impact that included choosing sites that are less in the way of seabirds' known flight routes or habitats; wind farm developers building alternative nesting sites; and developers funding conservation programmes to boost the species in other habitats.\u00a0\n\"Seabirds are a great case study for this [process], because we have a lot of data about many of these species,\" Ellis says. In addition, \"seabird conservation is very well understood\", she says, both in terms of specific threats to seabirds, such as predators and invasive plants, and also in terms of how to effectively address those threats, for example by removing predators such as rats, and clearing invasive plants. The assessment process outlined in the study could then also be used to reduce the impact of wind power on other species, such as bats and whales, with measures that are appropriate for them, she says.\nRegarding the environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction, some of the most important measures have aimed at reducing oil spills and chronic oil pollution, which can be catastrophic for birds and other wildlife. Monitoring of beached, oiled birds in Europe's North Sea has revealed a sharp decline in the rate of oiled birds, suggesting a decrease in oil pollution and spills as a result of measures such as requiring oil tankers to have double hulls.\nBut the attempts to lessen the local effects of energy infrastructure do little to address the wider context of climate change, the threat of which has led to international agreements to phase down fossil fuels. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are leading many parts of the world to feel the effects of global warming.\nAnd these are beginning to affect the environments where fossil fuels are extracted too. The Gulf of Mexico, for example, has been in the grip of a climate-change-fuelled marine heatwave, which can make hurricanes more intense.\nAlongside the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels, the intensity of extracting the oil in the Gulf of Mexico has an additional climate impact from the release of large quantities of methane \u2013 an even more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over a 20 year period.\nAlthough the global supply of renewable power is surging, and demand for oil, gas and coal are all predicted to peak this decade, the race to build energy infrastructure that doesn't harm wildlife looks set to be a challenge for years to come.\nHow the energy industry responds will be felt in habitats around the world.\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Angelababy has called Hong Kong home since she was a young girl. Here are her local insider picks, from shopping on Hollywood Road to hiking Dragon's Back.\nThe very name Hong Kong immediately conjures up luxury boutiques, wild nightlife, street food and spectacular architecture. We asked Hong Kong-based Hollywood actress and model Angelababy (Yeung Wing) to help us get to the heart of this dynamic place with so much to offer.\nThe SpeciaList\nChinese actress Angela Yang Ying, better known by her stage name Angelababy, moved to Hong Kong with her family at the age of 13 where she launched a meteoric modelling and film career. She went on to star in Mojin: The Lost Legend film, which, was on its release the highest-grossing Chinese-language IMAX film in China, and has starred in several Hollywood blockbusters. In 2016, she was named one of Forbes 30 Under 30.\nThe mega-famous actress and model \u2013 known for starring in the Chinese gameshow\u00a0Running Man\u00a0as well as various high-profile action films \u2013 has lived here since the age of 13, when her father's job brought the family from their native Shanghai.\n\"When I first arrived in Hong Kong, I was impressed by its skyline and harbour views,\" reminisces Angelababy. \"It's a very dynamic city. I felt that living here would be fun.\"\nThe future model soon found her new home was an exciting blend of cultures as well as modern and traditional architecture. \"Hong Kong is a real mix of East and West,\" explains Angelababy, about the former British colony. \"This is particularly evident in street names, most of which are directly translated from English and sound quite interesting.\"\nHong Kong's cultural celebrations include epic festivities like Lunar New Year in January when Victoria Harbour's sky is lit up with fireworks, the centuries old\u00a0Cheung Chau Bun Festival in May when competitors scramble up a tower of steamed buns filled with lotus paste and the thrilling Victoria Harbour river races of the Dragon Boat Festival in June. \"It's the culture that makes the city so special,\" says Angelababy.\nHere are Angelababy's favourite ways to explore Hong Kong.\nTo find the real Hong Kong, Angelababy recommends looking no further than a cha chaan teng\u00a0(tea restaurant). \"Tea houses are deeply rooted in Hong Kong's culinary culture. Traditional Hongkongers enjoy going to tea houses for lunch with family or friends.\"\nWhere to watch the Lunar New Year fireworks\nVisitors who want to watch the Lunar New Year fireworks (30 January 2025) in style could try this tip from Angelababy: \"Book a hotel like the Rosewood Hong Kong, The Peninsula Hong Kong or Regent Hong Kong,\" she says. \"At these hotels you can see the view of the fireworks and you can have your own private fireworks show.\"\nLocals and expats alike sit huddled around tables in these old-school cafes, which are decorated with whirling fans and patterned floor tiles. These iconic Hong Kong spots are known for serving European treats with an Asian twist, so expect cups of strong Hong Kong milk tea made with condensed or evaporated milk, flaky egg tarts and pineapple buns with a cracked surface resembling its spiky namesake fruit. \"If you're working on movies in Hong Kong, everybody stops at 15:15 for afternoon tea [and] we'll all enjoy an egg tart or a pineapple bun,\" says Angelababy. The actress has been hoping to try the newly renovated historic tea house Lin Heung Lau; originally established in the 1920s. \"So many friends say it's very good, but because it\u2019s so busy and hard to get a table, I haven't tried it yet,\" she says. \"But I know it will be worth it. You just have to see the videos.\"\nWebsite: https://linheunglau.shop/\nAddress: 160-164 Wellington Street, Central District, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 21160670\nInstagram: @linheunglau/?hl=en\nAnother culinary custom synonymous with Hong Kong culture is dim sum; a traditional Chinese brunch where a dazzling variety of small, savoury bites in bamboo baskets are wheeled through the restaurant on carts, to be shared with the whole table. \"[It's] quality time with family,\" says Angelababy. \"It's not just about filling the stomach; it's an experience.\" Hongkongers tuck into baskets of stewed, roasted or steamed dumplings such as char siu bao (doughy balls of sweet roast pork); siu mai (open-topped steamed dumplings); or soup dumplings filled with richly flavourful broth, which they wash down with tea.\nRide the Ding Ding\nAngelababy said that one of the most fun ways to travel around Hong Kong is on the double-decker tram that has been running since 1904. The super-skinny vintage tram can be found on Hong Kong Island. \"We call it the Ding Ding,\" says Angelababy. The name comes from the sound of the bell ringing twice that lets people know the tram is leaving.\nDim sum, which translates to \"touch the heart\" is believed to have originated in the port city of Ghangzhou and was brought by traders to Hong Kong in the 19th Century. It is now served across the city in five-star hotels and in tea houses. \"Hongkongers have a diverse palate, and dim sum encompasses a wide variety of dishes, perfectly catering to everyone's [tastes],\" says Angelababy. \"I believe the flavours of Hong Kong dim sum are unique; no matter how people from other countries try to imitate them, they seem unable to replicate those tastes.\"\nAngelababy loves to stop for dim sum at Lung Keen Heen in the newly renovated Four Seasons Hong Kong overlooking Victoria Harbour. \"I do prefer a window seat, but I don't mind any seat actually,\" she says. \"As long as I can get a table to dine there, I\u2019ll be happy.\"\u00a0Her picks: baked pineapple buns with barbecued pork and pine nuts along with a seasonal soup.\nWebsite: https://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong\nAddress: 4th floor, Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, 8 Finance Street, Central, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 3196 8882\nInstagram: @fshongkong/?hl=en\nHollywood Road was recently dubbed the second coolest street in the world by Time Out for its long history and constantly changing offerings. This historic street running between the Central and Sheung Wan neighbourhoods is filled with landmarks such as the 19th-Century Taoist Man Mo Temple, Michelin-starred restaurants, antique shops and galleries. Angelababy recommends a visit to G.O.D (Goods of Desire), which has quirky home buys. \"I love to stop at Hong Kong's creative art hub PMQ,\" she says, referencing the seven-storey 1950s former \"Police Married Quarters\", where the police and their families lived. \"There are many local designers' studios and workshops at PMQ. It's a very interesting place for creative exploration. [I\u2019ll visit] PMQ's [Night] Market, which has many small items, vintage goods and snacks.\"\nWebsite: https://www.pmq.org.hk/\nAddress: 35 Aberdeen Street\nPhone: +852 28702335\nInstagram:\u00a0@pmqhkdesign \u00a0\nHong Kong's hilly and mountainous terrain makes it great for outdoor sport. \"If I have visitors in Hong Kong, I will take them hiking,\" says Angelababy. \"That\u2019s one of the special things about Hong Kong. There are not that many cities where you can go hiking in nature in 30 or 40 minutes. You can just [pick up a bottle of] water and go.\"\nAngelababy recommends holidaymakers pull on their hiking shoes and hit Dragon's Back Mountain at Shek O Country\u00a0Park; a curvy mountain trail that overlooks Tai Tam Bay. \"It's not a hard walk and it comes with panoramic views,\" she says.\nDragon\u2019s Back Mountain can be found on the south-eastern corner of Hong Kong Island. The trek begins with a gentle walk that leads hikers through the forest, along the ridge of the mountain to Dragon's Back Viewing Point where people can see Stanley, Tai Tam Bay and Lamma Islands. \"You feel miles away from the city at Dragon\u2019s Back. I feel so relaxed when I'm there,\" says Angelababy. \"I [go] for a walk over Dragon\u2019s Back and then down to the white-sand beach of Big Wave Bay.\"\nWebsite: https://www.discoverhongkong.com/seasia/explore/great-outdoor/dragon-s-back-a-scenic-hike-from-shek-o-to-big-wave-bay.html\nAddress: Shek O Country Park\nPhone: +852 91878641\nInstagram:\u00a0@discoverhongkong\nHong Kong is home to 263 islands, including Lantau Island \u2013 known as \"the lungs of Hong Kong for its great swaths of indigenous forest \u2013 and the idyllic Lamma Island; a popular escape from the chaos of the mainland. Angelababy's Hong Kong island pick is the tranquil island of Tai O.\nHome to the Tanka boat people, Tai O's Venice-like canal is lined with 200-year-old fishermen\u2019s stilt houses. The fishermen on this island are famous for producing the island's salty shrimp paste used to add flavour and umami to many curries and sauces. Visitors can observe the fishermen puttering around the island in colourful sampan boats with their fresh daily catch.\nRecently, film crews have taken a shine to the historic island with its vintage shophouses; one even appeared on the Netflix show Restaurants on the Edge. But Angelababy loves heading to Tai O to see the island\u2019s famous pink dolphins. Despite their name, these beautiful, endangered creatures are actually white, only appearing pink due to the blood vessels that run close to the surface of their skin.\n\"I used to visit the island when I was young,\" she says. \" Now I take my son to see the pink dolphins. Last time, we arrived Tai O at 10:00 and then took a 30-minute boat tour out to sea to look for dolphins. I think you need some luck to see them, but not much. If you\u00a0go there in the good weather, you\u2019ve got a good chance.\"\nWebsite: https://www.discoverhongkong.com\nAddress: Tai O island\nPhone: +852 2508 1234\u00a0\nInstagram: @discoverhongkong\nProud mum Angelababy recommends that visitors check out Hong Kong Disneyland on Lantau Island or Hong Kong\u2019s own Ocean Park. First opened in the 1970s, this zoological theme park with more than 80 attractions has become one of the biggest theme parks in the world. \"It\u2019s really good for families,\" says Angelababy, who also enjoyed visiting as a teenager. \"The park has two parts.

        "article_text": "Winter isn't all bad \u2013 these \"sublime\" landscapes of the frozen North from the turn of the 20th Century offer us a way into resilience \u2013 and an \"acceptance of the seasonality of life\".\nWith its bare trees, long nights and icy temperatures, it's perhaps unsurprising that, culturally in the Northern Hemisphere, we seem so conditioned to complain about winter. Yet, as the author Katherine May points out in her 2020 book Wintering, winter is also a valuable time for rest and retreat. \"Winter offers us liminal spaces to inhabit,\" she writes. Its \"starkness\", she argues, re-sensitises us, and \"can reveal colours that we would otherwise miss\".\nFor Nordic countries, where, in some regions, the season can last more than six months, making peace with winter is a necessity, with concepts such as the Norwegian friluftsliv\u00a0(embracing the natural world) and the Danish hygge (hunkering down with simple comforts) offering fresh perspectives on cold weather.\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, the frozen North \u2013 with its vast fjords, mystical boreal forests and radiant light \u2013 became a powerful muse for artists such as Hilma af Klint, Edvard Munch and Harald Sohlberg. These artists immersed themselves in these cold climates, and developed a specifically Nordic style of painting imbued with their emotional responses to the landscape. Around 70 of these intensely atmospheric, expressionist works by artists from Scandinavia, Finland and Canada are being showcased in a new exhibition, Northern Lights, a cross-Atlantic collaboration that debuts at the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, before travelling to New York's Buffalo AKG Art Museum in August.\nIt was natural that these painters should be drawn to these wintery scenes, Ulf K\u00fcster, the exhibition's curator, tells the BBC. \"In Nordic landscapes, snow is a very dominant factor of life from October to late April\u2026 It's just this massive presence of white and nature and wilderness and vastness that really defines this landscape, and I think these painters have found a very interesting response to that.\" This burst of Nordic landscape painting was also a response to the changes that the painters perceived as a result of population growth and industrialisation. \"There was a big desire in the late 19th Century to return to pure nature and the simple life,\" explains K\u00fcster. \"You had these highly industrialised countries and pollution, and the pureness of white snow must have been quite a contrast.\" \u00a0\nMany of these northern regions were comparatively untouched by change, and featured vast, unpopulated vistas that were inherently painterly. Even today, Norway has a population of just 5.5 million, but a length of around 1,600km; while around three-quarters of Finland is still forested. To convey this scale, these paintings often adopt unconventional compositions where the view appears to stretch beyond the canvas. They are \"boundless\", says K\u00fcster. \"They don't have borders\". This is reinforced by the bird's-eye view adopted in works such as View from Pyynikki Ridge (1900) by the Finnish artist Helmi Biese. \"It's as if the artists have used a drone,\" remarks K\u00fcster.\nThe height and scope of these unpopulated views also convey a sense of isolation and loneliness. Harald Sohlberg, whose luminescent 1914 version of Winter Night in the Mountains is widely considered to be the national painting of Norway, wrote: \"The longer I stood gazing at the scene, the more I seemed to feel what a solitary and pitiful atom I was in an endless universe\u2026 It was as if I had suddenly awakened in a new, unimagined and inexplicable world\u2026 Above the white contours of a northern winter stretched the endless vault of heaven, twinkling with myriads of stars. It was like a service in some vast cathedral.\"\u00a0\nIt was this search for solitude that doubtless drew the Swedish artist Anna Boberg to the Norwegian archipelago of Lofoten, a remote location steeped in Viking folklore and, according to her 1901 memoir, \"the apotheosis of Arctic beauty and wilderness\". It was here, dressed head-to-toe in seal and reindeer fur, that she produced her Northern Lights (1901) painting, most likely sketched en plein air. In a commanding scene that speaks to the Romantic notion of \"the sublime\", prismatic streaks of light descend from the heavens dwarfing the snowy landscape.\nBoberg's awe when confronted with this dazzling wintry world with its unique light is clear. \"What really drove these people was to find a response to the extremities of nature \u2013 the very essence of snow, winter and ice.\" explains K\u00fcster. To achieve this, they would \"get as close to nature as possible\", he says. Far from hiding from the harsh winter, Boberg and her contemporaries immersed themselves in the landscape. \"They are painters who really wanted to paint the experience, to feel the extreme temperature and the snow blindness,\" says K\u00fcster. Munch, he continues, had outdoor studios, and would leave his paintings outside \"just to let nature test them\", while some of the Canadian painters would paddle out on to lakes and paint from their canoes. \u00a0\nInland, the boreal forest embodied the enchanting duality of these landscapes, which were both beautiful and barbaric. The dark, primeval forests became an emblem of foreboding in Nordic folklore and myth \u2013 places where you could get lost, and that concealed unknown dangers. The Nordic winter landscape fed the fairytales of the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. \"Below them the wind blew cold, wolves howled, and black crows screamed as they skimmed across the glittering snow,\" he writes in The Snow Queen (1844). \"But up above, the moon shone bright and large.\"\nThis storybook quality can be seen in Winter Moonlight (1895) by the Swedish painter Gustaf Fjaestad. Here, his clever use of pointillism makes the snow appear to glitter, while the hand-like branches of the dense, drooping trees look poised to come alive. In The Lair of the Lynx (1908), Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a Finn, also revels in this tantalising, darker side to the landscape, inviting us to scan the canvas for the dark places beasts may be lurking, and to follow their tracks in the snow.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eight nature books to change your life\n\u2022\u00a0The climate warnings in 19th-Century paintings\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nNotable, also, is the power and movement he gives to the snow as it winds in thick layers around the trees. \"The brushwork of this painting meticulously reacts to the layers of snow,\" says K\u00fcster. \"It's snowing, then it's freezing, there might be some sun and there's a little thaw, and then there's freezing again and more snow comes on top.\" The painter is clearly entranced by the snow, the layers of paint telling the snow's story. The visual effect, observes K\u00fcster, is \"like a sort of wedding cake\".\nAs well as drawing inspiration from the landscape's mythical associations, these artists participated in their own myth-making, expressing \u2013 through their own strong emotional responses to these unspoilt regions \u2013 an often idealised view of the Nordic winter. Some, such as Edvard Munch, nevertheless hinted at the changes threatening these serene expanses. During the winter of 1900, he stayed in Nordstrand on the banks of the Oslofjord. Here he painted his now-famous rendition of its serene waters reflecting a magnificent sky of pink, blue and yellow. But this picturesque, swirling scene, foregrounded by pines, is interrupted by a bulbous trail of white paint, denoting, not snow this time, but, as the title makes clear, Train Smoke.\n\"When we look back at the landscape works of Gallen-Kallela and Biese, we are reminded of how much of the environment has changed in the intervening century,\" writes Anna-Maria Pennonen in her essay Changing Landscapes in the exhibition catalogue. \"The Baltic Sea no longer freezes every winter, and the period when the ground is covered with snow in Helsinki can be very short, perhaps only a few weeks instead of months.\" As for the magnificent boreal forest, it continues to be threatened by logging and agriculture.\nRecognising the mutability of these environments now adds a powerful new dimension when a modern audience engages with these 100-year-old works. \"They ask us to think about the enchanting image of the forest in relation to its past and current transformation, as well as in relation to our own part therein,\" writes Helga Christoffersen in the catalogue. The works invite feelings of nostalgia and melancholy, and our appreciation that they are endangered only amplifies their beauty and psychological intensity.\nDanish artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen, born in 1987, addresses this issue of climate change in Boreal Dreams (2024), an interactive, immersive work and online experience, commissioned for Northern Lights. The work uses virtual reality to connect past, present and future boreal ecosystems. It takes visitors on a journey into five imagined futures for the boreal forest, marrying technology with environmental data to create a visceral experience of nature. Yet, however bleak the future seems, raw nature \u2013 \u00a0these works suggest \u2013 can offer something transcendent. \"We like to think that it's possible for life to be one eternal summer,\" writes May in Wintering. \"But life's not like that.\" By confronting and reframing winter, as these artists do, we can accept the seasonality of life, and cope better with the dark periods of our life. \"Winter had blanked me, blasted me wide open,\" she declares. \"In all that whiteness, I saw the chance to make myself new again.\"\u00a0\nNorthern Lights is at the Fondation Beyeler in Riehen/Basel in Switzerland until 25 May and at Buffalo AKG Art Museum, Buffalo, New York, from 1 August 2025 to 12 January 2026.

While the violent onset of the 1999 Kargil war between Pakistan and India unfolded around him, Hussain and his family escaped south to the remote Suru Valley.\nAfter India claimed victory later that year and displaced families returned home, Hussain listened as his bedridden grandfather asked the family to visit an old property, originally built by Hussain's great-grandfather, near Kargil's bazaar to make sure it had survived the war. When Hussain's uncles cracked through an old rusty latch and peered through the hand-carved wooden doors, they discovered wooden crates stamped with names of cities around the world. Making space on the dusty floor, the family began to lay out silks from China, silver cookware from Afghanistan, rugs from Persia, turquoise from Tibet, saddles from Mongolia and luxury soaps and salves from London, New York and Munich.\u00a0\nThey had found an abandoned treasure trove \u2013 a collection that would soon become recognised as one of the finest family-owned collections of Silk Road artefacts in India and a discovery that would change the course of Hussain's life.\nThat was 25 years ago. Today, centuries after it provided a crucial-yet-harrowing thoroughfare for Silk Road traders, the Himalayan mountain pass of Zoji La connecting Kashmir to Ladakh is still known as one of the most dangerous roads in the world. On a recent visit, my palms began to sweat as our 4x4 groaned its way higher up the mountainside. I glanced nervously out the window towards a glaciated peak at eye level, and the valley floor more than 1,000m below. No matter how close I pressed my nose against the window, I could not find the edge of the dirt road; just air and a long way to fall. In the front passenger seat, Hussain texted one of the many enterprises he runs with his family, including two hotels, two museums, a conservation NGO and a tour guide service. This was a regular commute for him, and one that his family had braved for centuries.\nI first met Hussain in 2023 while searching for snow leopards in eastern Ladakh. While sipping pink Kashmiri noon chai in a snow flurry at 4,265m, he told me stories of his own remarkable connection to the Silk Road. His flashbacks began with war, flirted with buried treasure and ended in reconciliation. As an archaeologist enamored with mountain history, I needed to learn more, so two years later, I found myself on the Zoji La in the footsteps of Silk Road traders who, like us, hoped to make it to the historic trading hub of Kargil before nightfall.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe mountainous region of Ladakh is situated in the westernmost corner of the Himalayas amongst the disputed borders of India, Pakistan and China. Towering peaks, steep glacial valleys and sweeping alpine plateaus dominate the landscape. Fields of barley blanket sandy floodplains; blindingly white apple and apricot blossoms paint the shores along the Indus River; and on the ridges above, snow leopards and Himalayan brown bears move like wraiths as they search for their next meal. Because of its location at the crossroads of commerce and conquest, modern Ladakh is home to a blend of cultures including Tibetan Buddhists, Muslims and a number of tribal communities.\nThe Silk Road refers to one of the world's largest overland trade routes \u2013 a network that spanned 6,400km connecting Europe to far East Asia. Although named for the Chinese silks that the Roman elite imported during the 1st Century AD, the cross-continental trade system was established much earlier. Once constructed, the network helped transport ideas, religions, commodities and currencies across the ancient world. While the connection between Europe and East Asia was severed in 1453 when the Ottomans boycotted China, segments of the Silk Road continued to exist regionally in places like Ladakh well into the 20th Century.\nA few days after our hair-raising crossing of Zoji La, Hussain and I sat at a small cafe in central Kargil eating dal and sipping masala chai. As the Islamic call to prayer echoed around the mountains of the Zanskar Range and wood smoke drifted in from a nearby bakery, Hussain explain why his family decided to protect and share their great-grandfather's treasure.\nSilk Road Kargil\nThe best way to experience Kargil's Silk Road history is to drive there along the ancient route from Leh or Srinagar. In Kargil, hundreds of artefacts displayed at the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum provide a detailed history of the route's fabled past. Just outside of town, stone-carved Greco-Buddhist-style buddhas from to 5th Century showcase the region's past connections to Central Asia and Mediterranean. For an in depth experience, Roots Ladakh offers a 10-day Silk Road expedition that follows the fabled route from Srinagar to Leh via Zoji La and Kargil.\nAt first, Hussain's family was unsure of what to do with the ancient items. In 2002, Florida Atlantic University anthropologists Dr Jacqueline Fewkes and Nasir Khan heard rumours of the collection and travelled to meet Hussain and his relatives. Recognising the artefacts' importance, the anthropologists encouraged the family to preserve the items for future generations. With Hussain's two uncles serving as the director and curator, the family opened the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum in central Kargil where visitors can explore hundreds of Silk Road artefacts ranging from 18th-Century Ladakhi sheep-horn bows to 19th-Century Chinese copper water pipes. To Fewkes, it is the personal anecdotes and family connection to the collection that makes this museum unique and important.\n\"The Munshi Aziz Bhat [museum] doesn't have to, and should not, be the British Museum or the Smithsonian because it offers its own perspective that is invaluable to both local and global audiences,\" Dr Fewkes told me, \"The stories [here] are focused on identities that are significant to the descendants \u2026 family and local histories provide an alternative understanding about the past than national or international narratives that you would see in larger museums in India or abroad.\"\nWhile his uncles run the day-to-day operations at the museum, Hussain focuses on research and retracing his family history \u2013 a heritage he hopes can provide an opportunity to attract visitors and more importantly, help his community reconcile with a difficult past.\n\"I think it's very important that everybody try to preserve their own family histories,\" added Hussain's uncle, Ajaz Munshi. \"In the age of modernisation, we are often going away from our roots, and we must try to keep our legacies intact.\"\nBorn in Leh in 1866, Hussain's great-grandfather, Munshi Aziz Bhat, travelled to Kargil after finishing school in Skardu (modern-day Pakistan). At that time, Kargil was known as an important hub on the Treaty Road \u2013 a branch of the old Silk Road that connected China to Central Asia via Kashmir.\n\"Kargil has always been tied to many parts of the world,\" Hussain told me. \"Its name literally means 'a place to stop [between kingdoms]'.\" A successful accountant, Bhat moved to Kargil where he started a small trade outpost that, by 1920, had grown into seven shops, an inn for travellers and a stable for the many camels, horses and yaks used by long-distance traders who had travelled for up to three months from places like Lhasa or Yarkand. At its height, Bhat's hub housed traders and goods moving between Central Asia, mainland India, China, Europe and the Americas.\n\"I found it interesting to discover how truly globalised this area was during that time,\" Hussain said. \"This region was really cosmopolitan then.\"\nBut Bhat's business was not to last. In 1948 the borders between India and Pakistan closed when the countries were partitioned, essentially shuttering all long-distance trade in and out of Kargil. Bhat retired as one of the last-known traders along one of the final sections of the Silk Road to close, dying later that year. \"When my great-grandfather closed the building,\" Hussain said, \"the rooms remained under lock and key for almost half a century.\"\u00a0\nThe following day while hiking on a ridge above the Mushkoh Valley, Hussain and I passed rings of rocks and an occasional sandbag that remained from the Kargil war. Since the conflict ended, this area located just a few kilometers from the de facto border with Pakistan, retains a lingering reputation amongst Indians as being war-torn and dangerous.\n\"In Kargil and other places impacted by war, I think there is an identity crisis and lack of pride,\" Hussain explained. \"I think tourism is a great tool to help because when people from the outside come to your community and appreciate your heritage, history and culture, it can help your pride return.\"\nHussain and his brother Tafazzul launched Roots Ladakh in 2013, a travel company focusing on the natural and cultural heritage of Kargil. While most visitors to Ladakh stay near the capital Leh to see Buddhist monasteries and search for snow leopards, Hussain hopes to slowly invite more people to his home.\n\"Our vision is to change the preconceived notion about our region as a warzone through the lens of heritage,\" he explained, poking at a fresh snow leopard track in the mud. \"I reminisce a lot about my ancestors and the interesting people they must have met. Kargil today is a transit location, just like in the past, and I feel like I am continuing that legacy by hosting travellers and guests.\"\nFollowing the old Silk Road, Hussain and I snaked our way up the Suru Valley towards the isolated Buddhist kingdom of Zanskar. Turning a corner, I saw three elderly women walking beneath the tongue of a massive glacier, carrying large stacks of hay on their backs. They were preparing for winter while chatting and walking to their homes, which were several steep kilometers away. Hussain offered them and their goods a ride. As the women climbed in, one asked what news Hussain had from the outside world.\nJust as his great-grandparents had done, Hussain turned towards his multicultural band of weary travellers and began to relay stories of politics, trade and faraway lands.\u00a0\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From the return of HBO's holiday-resort satire to a political thriller starring Robert De Niro and the latest violent period drama from Peaky Blinders creator Stephen Knight.\nAfter Jane Austen died, in 1817, her sister, Cassandra, destroyed many of her letters, guarding her privacy and setting generations of Janeites' and scholars' hair on fire. Miss Austen, based on Gill Hornby's bestselling novel, imagines what might have been behind all that. The series is wonderfully cast, with Keeley Hawes as Cassandra. It begins years after Jane's death, when Cassandra visits Isabella Fowle (Rose Leslie), \u00a0the niece of her long-dead fianc\u00e9, with the secret purpose of trying to find letters from Jane that might be in the vicarage. In flashbacks, Synnove Karlsen is the younger Cassandra and Patsy Ferran the young Jane. Max Irons and Alfred Enoch are also in the cast, because an Austen story always needs romance. Hawes teased the show in an interview with the Guardian, saying: \u201cIt feels like a classic costume drama, in the vein of Colin Firth in\u00a0Pride and Prejudice. Modern takes like Bridgerton are brilliant, but this feels like part of the Austen canon, so her fans will be pleased.\" The Austen industry is in overdrive this year, the 250th anniversary of her birth, but few projects are as tempting as this.\nMiss Austen premieres 2 February on BBC in the UK and 4 May on PBS in the US\nKaitlyn Dever, who has been great at comedy (Booksmart) and drama (2019 miniseries Unbelievable), takes on a bit of both in this fictional version of a true story. She plays Belle Gibson, an Australian influencer and con woman, who falsely said she had brain cancer and was curing it with natural ingredients and lifestyle, turning that lie into a financial empire selling apps and cookbooks. The show goes beyond her to include four other women in her orbit. One of them is under her spell, another becomes a business rival. The series is set in the early 2010s, at the dawn of Instagram, and tackles the rise of social media influencers. You can guess at its appeal. The show seems to echo the Netflix hit Inventing Anna, with Julia Garner as Anna Delvey, who masqueraded as an heiress, and was convicted of grand larceny and theft of services for her cons.\nApple Cider Vinegar premieres 6 February on Netflix internationally\nLaverne Cox stars in one of the last projects executive produced by the comedy legend Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at 101. She plays Desiree, a New York art gallery owner whose business collapses, and who returns home to Mobile, Alabama after 23 years away. Putting a new gender spin on some old sitcom tropes, the premise is that her father, Harry (comedian George Wallace), a car-wash owner she hasn't spoken to in all that time, has no idea that the child he thought of as his son has transitioned. Desiree moves into her old room, and the odd-couple, city-girl-in-a-small-town jokes begin, including one that has Harry putting money in a \"Pronoun Jar\" whenever he accidentally calls Desiree \"son\". Cox has been a staple of red carpet awards coverage lately. However this series turns out, it's probably time to remember how good she was in Orange is the New Black.\nClean Slate premieres 6 February on Amazon Prime\nThis drama about the decades-long aftershocks from a high-school soccer team's plane crash is another show returning after such a long gap, almost two years, that you need a refresher course before watching. Last season, as if being stranded in the woods and resorting to cannibalism when they were teenage girls wasn't enough, the adult versions of the characters faced life-or-death horror at the isolated location where Lottie (Simone Kessell) has formed a cult. As the adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey, the show's anchor) says in the third season trailer, \"Someone wants us dead\". Whoever it is already got poor Natalie in season two. The back-and-forth in time continues, with the main cast returning, including Lauren Ambrose as the adult Van, and Liv Hewson as her younger self, Christina Ricci as adult Misty, always up to something suspicious, and Elijah Wood as Walter, her demented citizen-sleuth colleague. Hilary Swank makes some guest appearances in the present day timeline. All we know so far is that she is already drenched in blood.\nYellowjackets premieres 14 February on Paramount Plus with Showtime in the US and Paramount Plus in the UK\nSeason three of Mike White's mordant social satire is set at the White Lotus resort in Thailand, and now there are snakes and monkeys along with the usual emotional upheaval. Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the spa manager at the Hawaii White Lotus in the first season, returns to take a training course at the new location. This time the guests include three old friends on a girls' trip, played by Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb, along with Jason Isaacs and Parker Posey as a married couple. Lalisa Manobal, better known as Lisa from the South Korean group Blackpink, plays Mook, a health and wellness counsellor at the resort, where health and wellness are undoubtedly in short supply.\u00a0\nThe White Lotus premieres 16 February on HBO and Max in the US and 17 February on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK\nThis political thriller starring Robert De Niro is intriguing and timely. When a cyberattack hits the US, causing devastation and deaths, former president George Mullen (De Niro) is called in to head a commission investigating the source, working against a barrage of problems and forces: big tech, Wall Street, rival political factions and a world of disinformation. Connie Britton plays Mullen's former chief of staff and Jesse Plemons is a former aide with political ambitions of his own. Joan Allen plays Mullen's wife, and Lizzy Caplan their daughter, a member of Congress. The plot deals with the slippery nature of truth itself. \"That's the spine of my character in the show,\" De Niro has said. \"Don't dodge anything. Don't play games. Be honest about what's going on so that the public knows what's going on.\" Angela Bassett plays the US president in casting that would have landed very differently if the US election had gone another way.\nZero Day premieres 20 February on Netflix internationally\nIn this animated family series from Pixar, eight members of a middle-school co-ed softball team, the Portland Pickles, are preparing for a championship game, with Will Forte as the voice of Coach Dan. Each episode focuses on a different character, from the school-age players to parents and coaches, and looks at their individual hopes, fears and insecurities, in a show whose message is to consider other people's points of view. There was recently a flutter of attention to the series for an extraneous reason, though, after word emerged that lines of dialogue identifying one character as transgender had been cut. Chanel Stewart, the 18-year-old trans actress who voices that character, told Deadline she was \"very disheartened\", and that \"I was excited to share my journey to help empower other trans youth\". In a statement, Disney said, \"When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we realize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.\"\nWin or Lose premieres 19 February on Disney+\nSteven Knight, the creator of Peaky Blinders, is right in his wheelhouse with another period piece about a criminal gang inspired by real-life stories, this time set in Victorian London and the world of illegal bare-knuckle boxing. Hezekiah (Malachi Kirby of Small Axe) and his friend Alec (Francis Lovehall, also of Small Axe) are Jamaicans who have come to London and who try to seek their fortunes as boxers. Hezekiah finds himself taken up and exploited by Mary Carr, the leader of the all-female band of robbers known as The Forty Elephants. Erin Doherty, who played Princess Anne as a young woman in The Crown, is far from that role as Carr. Stephen Graham stars as a boxer named Sugar Goodman, determined to defend his turf from the upstart Hezekiah. The stalwart Graham has played plenty of gritty characters, in Peaky Blinders and recently in Blitz, but had to bulk up for this role. \"Five meals a day, loads of protein, ice baths, I became like a proper athlete,\" he told Empire.\nA Thousand Blows premieres 21 February on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\nDavid Attenborough's nature documentaries have proven there is an apparently bottomless appetite for the genre. This variation stands apart because it has Tom Hanks narrating, with a sense of wonder. The series is an ambitious 10-part look at the Americas, with each episode focusing on a different area, ranging from Canada to Patagonia, the Atlantic coast to the Amazon. The production was epic, with 180 expeditions that took five years, making it what is likely the most expensive non-fiction show Universal Studios has ever done. Universal co-produced the show with the BBC, which also produces the Attenborough series. The music is composed by Oscar-winner Hans Zimmer, whose movie scores include Gladiator and Dune. But the soundtrack here also includes animal sounds, waves, and Hanks luring viewers in by saying, \"A wandering salamander. To find a mate he sets out on an extraordinary journey.\"\nThe Americas premieres 23 February on NBC in the US and in 2025 on BBC One in the UK\nAs Taylor Sheridan's prequel to his mega-hit series Yellowstone returns, the presence of either Harrison Ford or Helen Mirren might be enough to make you want to watch, and despite the near-death of Ford's character in season one, this series still has both. They are back as Jacob and Cara Dutton, who are enduring an especially hard winter on that familiar Montana ranch, not to mention the threat from an evil land-baron played by Timothy Dalton. Meanwhile, their nephew Spencer (Brandon Sklenar), is heading back from his African safari to help out, and Spencer's wife, Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer), an aristocrat from the UK, is trying to get across the Atlantic to her new home on the range (culture shock awaits). Ford growls in the teaser trailer, \"This ranch is under attack. Our whole way of life is under attack,\" which is pretty much an all-purpose Dutton line, available to use in any Yellowstone iteration.\n1923 premieres 23 February in the US and 24 February in the UK on Paramount+\nSuits, which ran on cable channel USA Network from 2011 to 2019, turned out to be an ideal show to binge. When the series about a firm of high-powered New York lawyers landed on Netflix, it became one of the most streamed series of 2023. We may never know how much that had to do with one of its stars being Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex. We do know that she is not in this spinoff set on the opposite coast. Neither is the rest of that cast (so far), with the exception of some guest appearances by Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter. The main character now is Ted Black (Stephen Amell), a former federal prosecutor in New York now running a powerful Los Angeles firm specialising in criminal and entertainment law. Aaron Korsh, the creator of Suits, also created the LA version. At first it was a different series, about Hollywood agents, which NBC passed on. He reconfigured that idea to exist in the same universe as Suits, and here we are.\nSuits LA premieres 23 February on NBC in the US\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

In a statement, Disney said, \"When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we realize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.\"\nWin or Lose premieres 19 February on Disney+\nSteven Knight, the creator of Peaky Blinders, is right in his wheelhouse with another period piece about a criminal gang inspired by real-life stories, this time set in Victorian London and the world of illegal bare-knuckle boxing. Hezekiah (Malachi Kirby of Small Axe) and his friend Alec (Francis Lovehall, also of Small Axe) are Jamaicans who have come to London and who try to seek their fortunes as boxers. Hezekiah finds himself taken up and exploited by Mary Carr, the leader of the all-female band of robbers known as The Forty Elephants. Erin Doherty, who played Princess Anne as a young woman in The Crown, is far from that role as Carr. Stephen Graham stars as a boxer named Sugar Goodman, determined to defend his turf from the upstart Hezekiah. The stalwart Graham has played plenty of gritty characters, in Peaky Blinders and recently in Blitz, but had to bulk up for this role. \"Five meals a day, loads of protein, ice baths, I became like a proper athlete,\" he told Empire.\nA Thousand Blows premieres 21 February on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\nDavid Attenborough's nature documentaries have proven there is an apparently bottomless appetite for the genre. This variation stands apart because it has Tom Hanks narrating, with a sense of wonder. The series is an ambitious 10-part look at the Americas, with each episode focusing on a different area, ranging from Canada to Patagonia, the Atlantic coast to the Amazon. The production was epic, with 180 expeditions that took five years, making it what is likely the most expensive non-fiction show Universal Studios has ever done. Universal co-produced the show with the BBC, which also produces the Attenborough series. The music is composed by Oscar-winner Hans Zimmer, whose movie scores include Gladiator and Dune. But the soundtrack here also includes animal sounds, waves, and Hanks luring viewers in by saying, \"A wandering salamander. To find a mate he sets out on an extraordinary journey.\"\nThe Americas premieres 23 February on NBC in the US and in 2025 on BBC One in the UK\nAs Taylor Sheridan's prequel to his mega-hit series Yellowstone returns, the presence of either Harrison Ford or Helen Mirren might be enough to make you want to watch, and despite the near-death of Ford's character in season one, this series still has both. They are back as Jacob and Cara Dutton, who are enduring an especially hard winter on that familiar Montana ranch, not to mention the threat from an evil land-baron played by Timothy Dalton. Meanwhile, their nephew Spencer (Brandon Sklenar), is heading back from his African safari to help out, and Spencer's wife, Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer), an aristocrat from the UK, is trying to get across the Atlantic to her new home on the range (culture shock awaits). Ford growls in the teaser trailer, \"This ranch is under attack. Our whole way of life is under attack,\" which is pretty much an all-purpose Dutton line, available to use in any Yellowstone iteration.\n1923 premieres 23 February in the US and 24 February in the UK on Paramount+\nSuits, which ran on cable channel USA Network from 2011 to 2019, turned out to be an ideal show to binge. When the series about a firm of high-powered New York lawyers landed on Netflix, it became one of the most streamed series of 2023. We may never know how much that had to do with one of its stars being Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex. We do know that she is not in this spinoff set on the opposite coast. Neither is the rest of that cast (so far), with the exception of some guest appearances by Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter. The main character now is Ted Black (Stephen Amell), a former federal prosecutor in New York now running a powerful Los Angeles firm specialising in criminal and entertainment law. Aaron Korsh, the creator of Suits, also created the LA version. At first it was a different series, about Hollywood agents, which NBC passed on.

        "article_text": "From the return of HBO's holiday-resort satire to a political thriller starring Robert De Niro and the latest violent period drama from Peaky Blinders creator Stephen Knight.\nAfter Jane Austen died, in 1817, her sister, Cassandra, destroyed many of her letters, guarding her privacy and setting generations of Janeites' and scholars' hair on fire. Miss Austen, based on Gill Hornby's bestselling novel, imagines what might have been behind all that. The series is wonderfully cast, with Keeley Hawes as Cassandra. It begins years after Jane's death, when Cassandra visits Isabella Fowle (Rose Leslie), \u00a0the niece of her long-dead fianc\u00e9, with the secret purpose of trying to find letters from Jane that might be in the vicarage. In flashbacks, Synnove Karlsen is the younger Cassandra and Patsy Ferran the young Jane. Max Irons and Alfred Enoch are also in the cast, because an Austen story always needs romance. Hawes teased the show in an interview with the Guardian, saying: \u201cIt feels like a classic costume drama, in the vein of Colin Firth in\u00a0Pride and Prejudice. Modern takes like Bridgerton are brilliant, but this feels like part of the Austen canon, so her fans will be pleased.\" The Austen industry is in overdrive this year, the 250th anniversary of her birth, but few projects are as tempting as this.\nMiss Austen premieres 2 February on BBC in the UK and 4 May on PBS in the US\nKaitlyn Dever, who has been great at comedy (Booksmart) and drama (2019 miniseries Unbelievable), takes on a bit of both in this fictional version of a true story. She plays Belle Gibson, an Australian influencer and con woman, who falsely said she had brain cancer and was curing it with natural ingredients and lifestyle, turning that lie into a financial empire selling apps and cookbooks. The show goes beyond her to include four other women in her orbit. One of them is under her spell, another becomes a business rival. The series is set in the early 2010s, at the dawn of Instagram, and tackles the rise of social media influencers. You can guess at its appeal. The show seems to echo the Netflix hit Inventing Anna, with Julia Garner as Anna Delvey, who masqueraded as an heiress, and was convicted of grand larceny and theft of services for her cons.\nApple Cider Vinegar premieres 6 February on Netflix internationally\nLaverne Cox stars in one of the last projects executive produced by the comedy legend Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at 101. She plays Desiree, a New York art gallery owner whose business collapses, and who returns home to Mobile, Alabama after 23 years away. Putting a new gender spin on some old sitcom tropes, the premise is that her father, Harry (comedian George Wallace), a car-wash owner she hasn't spoken to in all that time, has no idea that the child he thought of as his son has transitioned. Desiree moves into her old room, and the odd-couple, city-girl-in-a-small-town jokes begin, including one that has Harry putting money in a \"Pronoun Jar\" whenever he accidentally calls Desiree \"son\". Cox has been a staple of red carpet awards coverage lately. However this series turns out, it's probably time to remember how good she was in Orange is the New Black.\nClean Slate premieres 6 February on Amazon Prime\nThis drama about the decades-long aftershocks from a high-school soccer team's plane crash is another show returning after such a long gap, almost two years, that you need a refresher course before watching. Last season, as if being stranded in the woods and resorting to cannibalism when they were teenage girls wasn't enough, the adult versions of the characters faced life-or-death horror at the isolated location where Lottie (Simone Kessell) has formed a cult. As the adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey, the show's anchor) says in the third season trailer, \"Someone wants us dead\". Whoever it is already got poor Natalie in season two. The back-and-forth in time continues, with the main cast returning, including Lauren Ambrose as the adult Van, and Liv Hewson as her younger self, Christina Ricci as adult Misty, always up to something suspicious, and Elijah Wood as Walter, her demented citizen-sleuth colleague. Hilary Swank makes some guest appearances in the present day timeline. All we know so far is that she is already drenched in blood.\nYellowjackets premieres 14 February on Paramount Plus with Showtime in the US and Paramount Plus in the UK\nSeason three of Mike White's mordant social satire is set at the White Lotus resort in Thailand, and now there are snakes and monkeys along with the usual emotional upheaval. Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the spa manager at the Hawaii White Lotus in the first season, returns to take a training course at the new location. This time the guests include three old friends on a girls' trip, played by Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb, along with Jason Isaacs and Parker Posey as a married couple. Lalisa Manobal, better known as Lisa from the South Korean group Blackpink, plays Mook, a health and wellness counsellor at the resort, where health and wellness are undoubtedly in short supply.\u00a0\nThe White Lotus premieres 16 February on HBO and Max in the US and 17 February on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK\nThis political thriller starring Robert De Niro is intriguing and timely. When a cyberattack hits the US, causing devastation and deaths, former president George Mullen (De Niro) is called in to head a commission investigating the source, working against a barrage of problems and forces: big tech, Wall Street, rival political factions and a world of disinformation. Connie Britton plays Mullen's former chief of staff and Jesse Plemons is a former aide with political ambitions of his own. Joan Allen plays Mullen's wife, and Lizzy Caplan their daughter, a member of Congress. The plot deals with the slippery nature of truth itself. \"That's the spine of my character in the show,\" De Niro has said. \"Don't dodge anything. Don't play games. Be honest about what's going on so that the public knows what's going on.\" Angela Bassett plays the US president in casting that would have landed very differently if the US election had gone another way.\nZero Day premieres 20 February on Netflix internationally\nIn this animated family series from Pixar, eight members of a middle-school co-ed softball team, the Portland Pickles, are preparing for a championship game, with Will Forte as the voice of Coach Dan. Each episode focuses on a different character, from the school-age players to parents and coaches, and looks at their individual hopes, fears and insecurities, in a show whose message is to consider other people's points of view. There was recently a flutter of attention to the series for an extraneous reason, though, after word emerged that lines of dialogue identifying one character as transgender had been cut.

        "article_text": "Historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela explores life, love and death on Earth's second-tallest peak in the new season of Extreme.\nStraddling the border of Pakistan and China in the Karakoram mountain range, K2 is often referred to as the \"savage mountain\". Towering 8,611m and reaching into the heavens like a snowcapped pyramid, K2 is the world's second-tallest mountain (topped only by Everest) and arguably the hardest to climb. In Peak Danger, the second season of BBC's Extreme podcast, host and historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela chronicles the harrowing tale of newlyweds Cecilie Skog and Rolf Bae, who scaled K2 in 2008 \u2013 and found themselves in a disaster that would see 11 climbers lose their lives in two days.\nFor Skog, the allure of the mountains came early. She was born surrounded by formidable peaks and explains that even as a child, she often found herself drawn to the alpine heights all around her. Like many climbers, she called the rush of scaling mountains \"addictive\".\n\"I grew up in \u00c5lesund, a little town on the west coast of Norway, and surrounding this little town is mountains everywhere. It is really beautiful there,\" Skog says on the podcast. \"These mountains, they should have given it with, like a warning sign: 'this is really addictive.'\"\nWhile climbing mountains all over the world, Skog also found love and married climber Rolf Bae. After years of honing their skills, the couple decided their honeymoon would be the perfect opportunity to venture to Asia and attempt to scale K2. Their journey started in Pakistan at the Baltoro Glacier, a near-mythical landscape home to six peaks over 7,900m. The beautiful, nearly untouched scenery is one draw, but it is accompanied by the thrill of high altitude, steep cliffs and breathtaking ascents \u2013 and the always-present spectre of cheating death.\n\"If you are going to take on K2, you got to be at the top of your game. That is why it is known, in climbing circles, as 'the mountaineer's mountain,'\" Petrzela says. That reputation was something Skog and Bae were well aware of, as well as the inevitable possibility of facing a life-or-death emergency.\n\"The most important thing cannot be to summit; the most important thing has to be to come back home alive,\" Skog says in the podcast.\nUpon their arrival to the Karakoram Range, Skog and Bae joined some 30 hopeful, optimistic climbers from far-flung countries such as Serbia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and South Korea, as well as a team of Nepalese and Pakistani porters. They were experienced and knowledgeable about the conditions, the dangers and the possibility of inclement weather. Avalanches, rockfall and unpredictable blizzards weren't unheard of \u2013 but there was another sign: a memorial at the beginning of the journey dedicated to those who had lost their lives while attempting to scale K2.\n\"When you arrive, you see a huge pile of brown, weathered rocks, all stacked on top of one another. It is adorned with crisscrossing flags, and pictures of fallen climbers,\" Petrzela says.\nThe memorial isn't enough to deter climbers, nor is the low oxygen level and bitingly cold temperatures.\n\"What I experienced was: 'why am I here\u2026 am I in the right place?' I questioned myself. I questioned my motivation for being there,\" fellow climber Dr Eric Meyer says on the podcast. \"And then you start to reflect on\u2026 is it worth the risk?\"\nListen to the whole Extreme story\nPeak Danger is season 2 of Extreme, the BBC podcast about those who chase the impossible, who strive for superhuman status and refuse to accept that life has any limits. Historian and podcaster Natalia Mehlman Petrzela returns with a sky-high story of human vs nature and surviving against all the odds.\u00a0\nIf you would like to listen to the full podcast series, search for Extreme wherever you get your podcasts.\u00a0\nIt has never been easier for intrepid travellers to challenge themselves and face K2. Petrzela explains on the podcast that a cottage industry has materialised and offers all the necessities for anyone hoping to be among the few who can say they've summited the mountain. However, that commercialisation has led to concerns over climbers' safety and the sometimes-laissez-faire approach to what is undoubtedly a very dangerous trek.\n\"There is no rulebook to mountain climbing. No international association telling you what or how to climb. And there is nothing to stop anyone from making mountaineering into big business. Nowadays, for the right price, you too can buy your way onto the slopes of an 8,000m peak,\" Petrzela says. While there is no association overseeing all climbers, there is the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (or UIAA), which \"developed standards for over 25 types of safety equipment, including helmets, harnesses and [crampons]\".\nAs the group faced a few unexpected challenges \u2013 including a curious case of missing equipment \u2013 Skog explains that the prospect of turning around did enter her mind, but she was still drawn to the peak. \"[I thought] we should turn around, because this is crazy. But again... we are looking up and we can see the summit there. We are so close,\" Skog says. \"The closer you get to the summit, the harder it is to turn around.\"\n\"It is like a kind of compulsion, an inexorable force pulling them further and further up the mountain,\" Petrzela says.\nIn what would later be known as the 2008 K2 disaster \u2013 coming after a similar 1986 tragedy that saw five people die on the mountain \u2013 a massive ice avalanche swept away climbers' rope lines, causing many to fall from an especially treacherous section of the mountain known as the \"Bottlekneck\". The incident killed 11 climbers, including Bae. Even the ones lucky enough to make it off K2 were dealing with frostbite and other injuries. Survivors, Petrzela explains, felt \"shellshocked, like a soldier returning from war.\"\nThe names of the climbers were added to the makeshift memorial at basecamp. Reports would call the incident \"one of the worst tragedies in Himalayan history\".\nMore like this: \n \u2022\u00a0The big climate moments to look out for in 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Why some of the world's borders are changing\n\u2022\u00a0The mountaineers collecting hard-to-reach data\nStill, Skog continued adventuring \u2013 partly, she says, to feel the same sense of wonder she shared with her husband. She enlisted friends to trek across Greenland and, later, she completed an unassisted crossing of Antarctica. She has even returned to the Himalayas, though her new perspective has shifted everything, even summit fever.\n\"I did not have the same feeling being there. I felt that this does not belong to me anymore,\" she says.\n*This article is adapted from a script by Natalia Mehlman Petrzela and Leigh Meyer.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela explores life, love and death on Earth's second-tallest peak in the new season of Extreme.\nStraddling the border of Pakistan and China in the Karakoram mountain range, K2 is often referred to as the \"savage mountain\". Towering 8,611m and reaching into the heavens like a snowcapped pyramid, K2 is the world's second-tallest mountain (topped only by Everest) and arguably the hardest to climb. In Peak Danger, the second season of BBC's Extreme podcast, host and historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela chronicles the harrowing tale of newlyweds Cecilie Skog and Rolf Bae, who scaled K2 in 2008 \u2013 and found themselves in a disaster that would see 11 climbers lose their lives in two days.\nFor Skog, the allure of the mountains came early. She was born surrounded by formidable peaks and explains that even as a child, she often found herself drawn to the alpine heights all around her. Like many climbers, she called the rush of scaling mountains \"addictive\".\n\"I grew up in \u00c5lesund, a little town on the west coast of Norway, and surrounding this little town is mountains everywhere. It is really beautiful there,\" Skog says on the podcast. \"These mountains, they should have given it with, like a warning sign: 'this is really addictive.'\"\nWhile climbing mountains all over the world, Skog also found love and married climber Rolf Bae. After years of honing their skills, the couple decided their honeymoon would be the perfect opportunity to venture to Asia and attempt to scale K2. Their journey started in Pakistan at the Baltoro Glacier, a near-mythical landscape home to six peaks over 7,900m. The beautiful, nearly untouched scenery is one draw, but it is accompanied by the thrill of high altitude, steep cliffs and breathtaking ascents \u2013 and the always-present spectre of cheating death.\n\"If you are going to take on K2, you got to be at the top of your game. That is why it is known, in climbing circles, as 'the mountaineer's mountain,'\" Petrzela says. That reputation was something Skog and Bae were well aware of, as well as the inevitable possibility of facing a life-or-death emergency.\n\"The most important thing cannot be to summit; the most important thing has to be to come back home alive,\" Skog says in the podcast.\nUpon their arrival to the Karakoram Range, Skog and Bae joined some 30 hopeful, optimistic climbers from far-flung countries such as Serbia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and South Korea, as well as a team of Nepalese and Pakistani porters. They were experienced and knowledgeable about the conditions, the dangers and the possibility of inclement weather. Avalanches, rockfall and unpredictable blizzards weren't unheard of \u2013 but there was another sign: a memorial at the beginning of the journey dedicated to those who had lost their lives while attempting to scale K2.\n\"When you arrive, you see a huge pile of brown, weathered rocks, all stacked on top of one another.

        "article_text": "The Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by Soviet troops on 27 January 1945. Anita Lasker, a Jewish teenager, managed to survive there simply because the camp orchestra needed a cello player.\nNow aged 99, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch is the last remaining survivor of the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz. At the age of 19, she was interviewed by the BBC on 15 April 1945, the day of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen death camp where she had been transferred six months earlier. Interviewed in German, the language she grew up speaking, she said: \"First, I would like to say a few words about Auschwitz. The few who have survived are afraid that the world will not believe what happened there.\"\nWarning: This article contains graphic details of the Holocaust \n\nShe continued: \"A doctor and a commander stood on the ramp when the transports arrived, and sorting was done right before our eyes. This means they asked for the age and health condition of the new arrivals. The unsuspecting newcomers tended to report any ailments, thereby signing their death sentences. They particularly targeted children and the elderly. Right, left, right, left. To the right was life; to the left, the chimney.\"\nWhen she first arrived at the Auschwitz unloading platform known as the ramp, her casual comment that she played the cello was enough to change the direction of her life. \"Music was played to accompany the most terrible things,\" she said.\nThe then Anita Lasker barely spoke German in public again for 50 years after World War Two, but when she was growing up, her hometown of Breslau was part of Germany. Now known as Wroc\u0142aw, it has been part of Poland since the end of the war. Lasker's mother Edith was a talented violinist and her father Alfons was a successful lawyer. As the youngest of three daughters, she grew up in a happy home where music and other cultural pursuits were encouraged. She knew at an early age that she wanted to be a cellist, but outside the sanctuary of her family home, darker forces were stirring.\nShe recalled on a BBC television documentary in 1996: \"We were the typical assimilated German-Jewish family. We went to a little private school, and I suddenly heard, 'Don't give the Jew the sponge,' and I thought, 'What is all this?'\"\u00a0\nBy 1938, as antisemitism took hold in Nazi Germany, Lasker's parents couldn't find a cello tutor in Breslau who would teach a Jewish child. She was sent to Berlin to study, but had to rush back to her parents after a night of murder and mayhem. On 9 November 1938, the insidious persecution of Jewish people turned violent as Nazis smashed the windows of homes, businesses and synagogues on Kristallnacht\u00a0or \"the night of broken glass\".\u00a0\nBack at home, Lasker's parents continued to instil a love of culture in their children, as \"nobody can take that away from us\". Her eldest sister Marianne escaped in 1939 on the Kindertransport, the mission which took thousands of children to safety in Britain just before the war. By 1942, even as \"the world was falling to pieces\", her father still had Anita and her sister Renate discussing sophisticated works such as Friedrich Schiller's tragic play Don Carlos. However, it was \"obvious what was going to happen\", she said.\nIn April 1942, the dreaded order came for her parents to report to a certain location within 24 hours. \"We walked through Breslau, not just my parents but a whole column of people, to this particular point and said goodbye. That was the end. I only understood what my parents must have gone through when I became a parent myself. By then, one had already started to suppress the luxury of feelings.\"\nAnita and Renate were sent to a Jewish orphanage, but they soon hatched a plan to escape from Nazi Germany. Posing as women on their way home to unoccupied France, they set off with two friends for Breslau railway station clutching forged papers. The plan failed and they were arrested by officers of the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police force. Anita served about 18 months in jail on charges of forgery, aiding the enemy and attempted escape, but at least she was relatively safe there. \"Prison is not a pleasant place to be in, but it's not a concentration camp,\" she said. \"Nobody kills you in a prison.\"\u00a0\nIn 1943, because of overcrowding in Breslau prison, any remaining Jewish people were relocated to concentration camps. Anita was put on a train to be taken to Auschwitz, and Renate was sent two weeks later. Anita arrived in the camp at night to find a terrible scene: \"I remember it was very noisy and totally bewildering. You had no idea where you were. Noisy with the dogs, people screaming, a horrible smell... You'd arrived in hell, really.\"\u00a0\nUpon arrival, she was tattooed and shaved by Auschwitz prisoners who were eager for any news about the war. \"I said, 'Look, I can't tell you too much because I've been in prison for a long time,' and casually mentioned that I played the cello. And this girl said, 'Oh, that is very good. You might be saved.' The situation was unbelievable, really. I was naked, I had no hair, I had a number on my arm, and I had this ridiculous conversation. She went and got Alma Ros\u00e9, who was the conductor of the orchestra, so I became a member of the famous Women's Orchestra.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nAlma Ros\u00e9 was a niece of composer Gustav Mahler, while her father was leader of the Vienna Philharmonic. The violinist ran the camp orchestra with fearsome professionalism, according to Lasker: \"She succeeded in making us so worried about what we were going to play and whether we were playing well that we temporarily didn't worry about what was going to happen to us.\"\nUsing instruments stolen from other people who had been brought to the camp, the orchestra played its limited repertoire of military music. \"Our job was to play marches for the columns that worked outside the camp when they marched out, and in the evening when they came back in,\" she said.\u00a0\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's\u00a0Desert Island Discs\u00a0in 1996, Lasker said that while Ros\u00e9 set \"enormously high standards\", she did not think it was because of a fear of being murdered if they failed to play well. \"It was an escape somehow into excellence,\" she said. \"Somehow you come to terms with the fact that eventually they're going to get you, but whilst they haven't got you, you just carry on. I think one of the ingredients of survival was to be with other people. I think anybody on their own really didn't have a chance.\"\u00a0\nRos\u00e9 did not survive the war, dying of suspected botulism in April 1944. Lasker said: \"I think we owe our lives to Alma. She had a dignity which imposed itself even on the Germans. Even the Germans treated her as if she were a member of the human race.\"\nThe music stopped in October 1944 when the women were transferred to Belsen, a concentration camp where there was no orchestra. Conditions there were unimaginably awful. Lasker said: \"It wasn't actually an extermination camp \u2013 it was a camp where people perished. There were no gas chambers there, no need for gas chambers \u2013 you just died of disease, of starvation.\"\u00a0\nThe liberation of Belsen by British troops in April 1945 saved her life. \"I think another week and we probably wouldn't have made it because there was no food and no water left,\" she said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The man who saved 669 children from the Nazis\n\u2022\u00a0Anne Frank's father on his daughter's diary\n\u2022\u00a0How WW2's D-Day began with a death-defying mission\nAfter the war, Anita and Renate contacted their sister Marianne in the UK, and in 1946 they both settled in Britain. Renate went on to work as an author and journalist, moving to France with her husband in 1982. She died in 2021, 11 days shy of her 97th birthday. Marianne, the eldest sister who was brought to safety on the Kindertransport, died in childbirth soon after the war. \"Such are the ironies of fate,\" she\u00a0told the Guardian in 2005.\nAnita pursued a career as a successful musician, becoming a founder member of the English Chamber Orchestra. On a visit to Paris, she was put in touch with Peter Wallfisch, a piano student and fellow refugee whom she remembered from her school days in Breslau. They married in 1952 and had two children, cello player Raphael and psychotherapist Maya. While Lasker and her husband communicated with each other in \"a total mixture of languages\", she admitted that \"it would have been totally impossible for me to speak German to my children\".\u00a0\nFor decades, she vowed never again to set foot on German soil, fearing that anyone of a certain age could have been \"the very person who murdered my parents\". With the passage of time, she softened her stance, and by 2018 she was invited to Berlin to address politicians in the Bundestag, the German parliament. She said: \"As you see, I broke my oath \u2013 many, many years ago \u2013 and I have no regrets. It's quite simple: hate is poison and, ultimately, you poison yourself.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

However, it was \"obvious what was going to happen\", she said.\nIn April 1942, the dreaded order came for her parents to report to a certain location within 24 hours. \"We walked through Breslau, not just my parents but a whole column of people, to this particular point and said goodbye. That was the end. I only understood what my parents must have gone through when I became a parent myself. By then, one had already started to suppress the luxury of feelings.\"\nAnita and Renate were sent to a Jewish orphanage, but they soon hatched a plan to escape from Nazi Germany. Posing as women on their way home to unoccupied France, they set off with two friends for Breslau railway station clutching forged papers. The plan failed and they were arrested by officers of the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police force. Anita served about 18 months in jail on charges of forgery, aiding the enemy and attempted escape, but at least she was relatively safe there. \"Prison is not a pleasant place to be in, but it's not a concentration camp,\" she said. \"Nobody kills you in a prison.\"\u00a0\nIn 1943, because of overcrowding in Breslau prison, any remaining Jewish people were relocated to concentration camps. Anita was put on a train to be taken to Auschwitz, and Renate was sent two weeks later. Anita arrived in the camp at night to find a terrible scene: \"I remember it was very noisy and totally bewildering. You had no idea where you were. Noisy with the dogs, people screaming, a horrible smell... You'd arrived in hell, really.\"\u00a0\nUpon arrival, she was tattooed and shaved by Auschwitz prisoners who were eager for any news about the war. \"I said, 'Look, I can't tell you too much because I've been in prison for a long time,' and casually mentioned that I played the cello. And this girl said, 'Oh, that is very good. You might be saved.' The situation was unbelievable, really. I was naked, I had no hair, I had a number on my arm, and I had this ridiculous conversation.

The violinist ran the camp orchestra with fearsome professionalism, according to Lasker: \"She succeeded in making us so worried about what we were going to play and whether we were playing well that we temporarily didn't worry about what was going to happen to us.\"\nUsing instruments stolen from other people who had been brought to the camp, the orchestra played its limited repertoire of military music. \"Our job was to play marches for the columns that worked outside the camp when they marched out, and in the evening when they came back in,\" she said.\u00a0\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's\u00a0Desert Island Discs\u00a0in 1996, Lasker said that while Ros\u00e9 set \"enormously high standards\", she did not think it was because of a fear of being murdered if they failed to play well. \"It was an escape somehow into excellence,\" she said. \"Somehow you come to terms with the fact that eventually they're going to get you, but whilst they haven't got you, you just carry on. I think one of the ingredients of survival was to be with other people. I think anybody on their own really didn't have a chance.\"\u00a0\nRos\u00e9 did not survive the war, dying of suspected botulism in April 1944. Lasker said: \"I think we owe our lives to Alma. She had a dignity which imposed itself even on the Germans. Even the Germans treated her as if she were a member of the human race.\"\nThe music stopped in October 1944 when the women were transferred to Belsen, a concentration camp where there was no orchestra. Conditions there were unimaginably awful. Lasker said: \"It wasn't actually an extermination camp \u2013 it was a camp where people perished. There were no gas chambers there, no need for gas chambers \u2013 you just died of disease, of starvation.\"\u00a0\nThe liberation of Belsen by British troops in April 1945 saved her life. \"I think another week and we probably wouldn't have made it because there was no food and no water left,\" she said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The man who saved 669 children from the Nazis\n\u2022\u00a0Anne Frank's father on his daughter's diary\n\u2022\u00a0How WW2's D-Day began with a death-defying mission\nAfter the war, Anita and Renate contacted their sister Marianne in the UK, and in 1946 they both settled in Britain.

On a visit to Paris, she was put in touch with Peter Wallfisch, a piano student and fellow refugee whom she remembered from her school days in Breslau.

        "article_text": "The Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by Soviet troops on 27 January 1945. Anita Lasker, a Jewish teenager, managed to survive there simply because the camp orchestra needed a cello player.\nNow aged 99, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch is the last remaining survivor of the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz. At the age of 19, she was interviewed by the BBC on 15 April 1945, the day of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen death camp where she had been transferred six months earlier. Interviewed in German, the language she grew up speaking, she said: \"First, I would like to say a few words about Auschwitz. The few who have survived are afraid that the world will not believe what happened there.\"\nWarning: This article contains graphic details of the Holocaust \n\nShe continued: \"A doctor and a commander stood on the ramp when the transports arrived, and sorting was done right before our eyes. This means they asked for the age and health condition of the new arrivals. The unsuspecting newcomers tended to report any ailments, thereby signing their death sentences. They particularly targeted children and the elderly. Right, left, right, left. To the right was life; to the left, the chimney.\"\nWhen she first arrived at the Auschwitz unloading platform known as the ramp, her casual comment that she played the cello was enough to change the direction of her life. \"Music was played to accompany the most terrible things,\" she said.\nThe then Anita Lasker barely spoke German in public again for 50 years after World War Two, but when she was growing up, her hometown of Breslau was part of Germany. Now known as Wroc\u0142aw, it has been part of Poland since the end of the war. Lasker's mother Edith was a talented violinist and her father Alfons was a successful lawyer. As the youngest of three daughters, she grew up in a happy home where music and other cultural pursuits were encouraged. She knew at an early age that she wanted to be a cellist, but outside the sanctuary of her family home, darker forces were stirring.\nShe recalled on a BBC television documentary in 1996: \"We were the typical assimilated German-Jewish family. We went to a little private school, and I suddenly heard, 'Don't give the Jew the sponge,' and I thought, 'What is all this?'\"\u00a0\nBy 1938, as antisemitism took hold in Nazi Germany, Lasker's parents couldn't find a cello tutor in Breslau who would teach a Jewish child. She was sent to Berlin to study, but had to rush back to her parents after a night of murder and mayhem. On 9 November 1938, the insidious persecution of Jewish people turned violent as Nazis smashed the windows of homes, businesses and synagogues on Kristallnacht\u00a0or \"the night of broken glass\".\u00a0\nBack at home, Lasker's parents continued to instil a love of culture in their children, as \"nobody can take that away from us\". Her eldest sister Marianne escaped in 1939 on the Kindertransport, the mission which took thousands of children to safety in Britain just before the war. By 1942, even as \"the world was falling to pieces\", her father still had Anita and her sister Renate discussing sophisticated works such as Friedrich Schiller's tragic play Don Carlos. However, it was \"obvious what was going to happen\", she said.\nIn April 1942, the dreaded order came for her parents to report to a certain location within 24 hours. \"We walked through Breslau, not just my parents but a whole column of people, to this particular point and said goodbye.

        "article_text": "Sweden's long, cold nights might put you off going there in winter, unless, that is, you are in search of that elusive 21st-Century luxury: a good night's sleep.\nThe ferry cuts through the icy Baltic waters as it makes its way around the Stockholm Archipelago. Place names like Skarp\u00f6, Hj\u00e4lm\u00f6\u00a0and G\u00e4lln\u00f6 are painted on rust-red huts lining the jetties. The suffix \"\u00d6\" means island in Swedish, a pictorial representation of a land mass surrounded by sea with two tiny people about to dock.\nI am the only person to disembark at Svarts\u00f6, one of the few islands in the archipelago where accommodation remains open in winter. I make my way along a snowy track to Sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdshotell where I am shown to a cabin on the edge of a forest overlooking the dark expanse of Lake Svarts\u00f6fladen. It feels about as far away from it all as you can get.\nMy room is Swedish simplicity at its most minimal: a bed, a chair and a bedside table. No television, and not much else to distract me from the pristine tranquillity of my surroundings. This is just as well as I am here, primarily, to sleep.\nIn an age of relentless connectivity, sleep has become the ultimate luxury and spawned a new travel trend: sleep tourism, where sleep-deprived travellers are choosing their hotel on the basis of its pillow menu or booking themselves into away-from-it-all sleep retreats with tailored sleep-inducing activities.\nSweden has a different, more natural approach to sleep tourism, however, taking its cue from the landscape and a more traditional way of life. Often associated with bustling, connected cities like Stockholm and Gothenberg, come winter Sweden embraces its sleepy side and is inviting visitors to do the same.\n\"The abundance of accessible nature and large areas of peaceful wilderness, combined with dark nights, cool temperatures and a cultural emphasis on relaxation, makes Sweden an ideal location for sleep tourism,\" explains Christian Benedict, a sleep researcher at Sweden's Uppsala University. \"Studies have shown that technology and the way it impinges on our lives has a significant effect on our sleep, and spending more time in nature is tied to better mental health and fewer sleepless nights.\"\nWell World\nBBC Travel's Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\nWhen I decided to try it for myself, I chose the Stockholm archipelago, a nature-lovers paradise with more than 30,000 islands, many of them uninhabited. Svarts\u00f6 is one of the larger isles but has only around 65 year-round residents. A two-hour ferry ride from Stockholm, in summer it's a popular getaway, luring weekenders and holiday makers with summerhouses, a clutch of restaurants and abundance of nature in which to walk, swim, cycle and kayak.\nIn the winter months, the Sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdshotell is the only accommodation open and its cosy forest cabins, set away from the main building in their own peaceful wooded area, offer the type of peace and quiet that I am after, while not leaving me completely alone in the wilderness.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a city dweller with a restless mind. I often wake several times a night and rise early feeling the need to tackle the long list of things that have kept me awake. Here, on the island in winter, there is little for me to do except hike, read and observe the rhythms of the day in a way I can't when surrounded by the bright lights of a city. \n \n Svarts\u00f6 literally means \"the black island\", referring to the dark granite bedrock, though in winter the name could simply refer to the dark skies that are completely free of city glare. Darkness, long viewed as a metaphor for fear and depression, is embraced in these Nordic regions. Further north in the Arctic Circle, where the polar night blankets the land in darkness for months, far from staying indoors, inhabitants strap on headlamps and explore snowy trails.\nSo I do the same, setting out at dusk past fields of sheep, pigs and goats. I head along the edge of the forest and wander down to the seashore, watching as the sun drops into the water and listening as the noisy drilling of a woodpecker stops, almost as if a switch has been flicked. The surrounding forest falls quiet as the Earth settles down for its own good night's sleep beneath a heavy blanket of snow.\nI find the hotel sauna discreetly tucked between the trees and end the day in classic Scandinavian style, sweating out all the worries that might keep me awake followed by a plunge in the bracing sea.\nAfter a simple dinner of st\u00e5ngkorv (Swedish sausage and kale), I sit by the fire and get talking to a group of kayakers who have paddled here from Stockholm. \"Traditionally, in the darker months, fire was important for warmth and light but also as part of the evening ritual,\" a woman named Marie tells me. \"After dinner people would cosy up around the fire and allow the flicker of flames to sooth away all the stresses of a day's work.\"\nIt works for me. In fact, I find it so soporific that by 20:00 I am ready to retire to my cabin where I hunker down under a duvet and cosy woollen blanket and sleep for an unheard-of 10 hours, waking refreshed to see a sliver of moon above the trees outside.\nIt's easy to think of sleep deprivation as a very 21st-Century problem, but the Swedish legend of the Mara shows that it's as old as the forest. A strange mythical being that was said to torture people in their sleep, causing fear and tight anxiety-ridden chests, Mara gave rise to the word \"nightmare\". But in modern times, technological distractions have replaced mythical creatures as more and more people struggle to get to sleep.\n\"Sweden is one of Europe's most digitalised societies and were early adopters of digitalisation,\" explains Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Cedercreutz, chief commercial officer for Sweden's Scandic Hotels Group. \"Our interest in sleep, and especially the lack of it, can be traced to this and an increased awareness of its impact on our health, which we have set out to counteract with a range of measures. We have blackout rooms, sleep-inducing playlists and wellness areas where mobile phones are banned. If our customers don't sleep, our business as well as their health suffers.\"\nMore like this:\n \u2022 Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n \u2022\u00a0Sweden's wild, animal-free safari\n \u2022\u00a0 The new travel retreats addressing depression and grief\nAround the globe, other, both urban and remote hotels are taking things several steps further.\nLondon's Cadogan Hotel has its own Sleep Concierge service , developed in association with hypnotherapist and sleep expert Malminder Gill, who provides a programme of guided sleep meditation. Mandarin Oriental Geneva has a three-day package, run with a private sleep clinic, that involves studying guests' sleeping patterns and creating individual sleep programmes. In Thailand, amidst the tropical greenery on the Royal Coast, the Civa-Som Hua Hin resort's resident naturopath will guide you through everything from diet to hormones that may be affecting circadian rhythms. Meanwhile, the Carillon Miami Wellness Resort uses electromagnetic and infrared technologies to get guests to sleep.\n\"Our clients were coming to us saying they felt generally depleted, and this often seemed to be down to lack of sleep,\" says Stella Photi, founder of holiday company Wellbeing Escapes. \"We try to incorporate elements of the local cultures into our sleep programmes.\u00a0In Buddhist countries such as Thailand or Sri Lanka we offer mediation and mindfulness. In India, Ayurvedic treatments use locally sourced herbs; and in Italy, guided walks through vineyards are part of a sleep-promoting programme of activities.\"\nIn Sweden, however, it is the experience of being in nature that forms the bedrock of sleep tourism. \"Nature's motto is keep it simple,\" says Jennie Walker, founder of Walkers Naturturer, a nature-guiding business in Sweden's West Coast Archipelago. \"In winter, on the barren outcrops that characterise the Gothenburg Archipelago, there is little vegetation, and the birch and pine trees turn away from the strong west winds. A walk over the boulder fields on a winter's day, perhaps coming across a sunbathing harbor seal on one of the skerries, is the perfect preparation for a good night's rest.\"\nAnd where traditional sleep retreats focus on unwinding before bedtime, in Sweden the focus on sleep begins at dawn with the possibility of pursuing sleep-inducing activities such as hiking, kayaking and forest bathing.\u00a0\nSo, after my mammoth night's sleep, I fuel up with a breakfast of muesli, yoghurt, lingonberry jam and cinnamon buns to hike the Svarts\u00f6 section of the Stockholm Archipelago Trail. This unique 270km long-distance path traverses 20 islands, from Arholma in the north to Landsort in the south.\nOn Svarts\u00f6, the 18km trail takes me around the island, past a large freshwater lake and through the thick snow-carpeted pine forest where I spot the odd red squirrel, follow deer tracks and step over a tree felled by a beaver's gnawing. The whole day is like an extended forest bathing experience, and by the time I head back to my cabin there is little for me to worry about beyond dinner, sitting by the fire and sleeping well \u2013 or \"sov gott\" as they say in the land of sleep.\nAnd I did. It seems that, for me, gentle exercise in peaceful surroundings with few distractions and taking my cue for bed from nature, provides the perfect Circadian reset.\n\"Sleep retreats are not just helping people sleep when they are on holiday,\" says Photi, \"The objective is to allow for a relaxing, holistic and personal approach that will set you up with new sleep, and waking habits, with the aim of bringing about long-lasting change.\"\u00a0\nI'll sleep on that.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

The surrounding forest falls quiet as the Earth settles down for its own good night's sleep beneath a heavy blanket of snow.I find the hotel sauna discreetly tucked between the trees and end the day in classic Scandinavian style, sweating out all the worries that might keep me awake followed by a plunge in the bracing sea.After dinner people would cosy up around the fire and allow the flicker of flames to sooth away all the stresses of a day's work \u2013 MarieAfter a simple dinner of st\u00e5ngkorv (Swedish sausage and kale), I sit by the fire and get talking to a group of kayakers who have paddled here from Stockholm. \"Getty ImagesA sauna is an essential and classic winter experience in Sweden (Credit: Getty Images)In Sweden, however, it is the experience of being in nature that forms the bedrock of sleep tourism. This is just as well as I am here, primarily, to sleep.In an age of relentless connectivity, sleep has become the ultimate luxury and spawned a new travel trend: sleep tourism, where sleep-deprived travellers are choosing their hotel on the basis of its pillow menu or booking themselves into away-from-it-all sleep retreats with tailored sleep-inducing activities.Sweden has a different, more natural approach to sleep tourism, however, taking its cue from the landscape and a more traditional way of life.",

Here are her Dubai picks, from heavenly massages to crystal shopping.\nIn just half a century, the Emirati city of Dubai has gone from a small fishing village on the banks of the Dubai Creek to a thriving metropolis synonymous with over-the-top luxury. It's home to the Burj Khalifa \u2013 the world's tallest tower \u2013 and Deep Dive Dubai \u2013 the world's deepest pool \u2013 and it's now building the $2bn (\u00a31.64bn) mega-mall Dubai Square, the largest in the world.\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nBut even though it plays hard, Dubai doesn't forget to take care of itself; it was recently named the World's Best Spa Destination 2024 at the World Spa Awards.\nTo get to the heart of this burgeoning capital of self-care, we spoke to makeup artist-turned beauty mogul Huda Kattan, who has called Dubai home since 2008.\nThe SpeciaList\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nFor Kattan, who was born and raised in the United States but lived in the UAE for two years as a child, moving to Dubai was a homecoming. \"It's an extremely fast paced, multicultural environment,\" says Kattan, who travels endlessly around the globe for her work as the founder and CEO of Huda Beauty cosmetics. \"It's probably one of the fastest-moving [cities] I've ever seen. When I go to New York, New York is way too slow for me.\"\nKattan, whose brand headquarters is in Dubai, loves hitting the spa in her downtime. \"[It's] the best,\" she says. \"It's about going to the spas, enjoying the massages, doing the hammams, the facials. It's about investing in yourself for sure.\"\nAnd Dubai's foothold in the beauty world is also growing. Dior opened its first spa in the city in 2024 and the five-star Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab hotel with its three-storey spa will open in 2025. \"Dubai is definitely getting a lot more credibility in beauty,\" says Kattan. \"I have big celebrities asking me, 'What is happening in Dubai? What are all the treatments that people are doing?'\"\nBut self-care in Dubai isn't just about spa treatments; its glamorous shops are a strong prescription for retail therapy, while its stunning coastal panoramas refresh mind, body and soul.\nHere are Kattan's favourite ways to indulge in self-care in Dubai.\nKattan experienced her first-ever massage in Dubai 16 years ago and was instantly hooked. \"I'd never had a massage in my life until I moved here,\" she says. \"When I got my first massage, I fell asleep and was snoring and slobbering. I was like, 'What is this? This is the best experience of my life'. I now have them regularly.\"\nVisitors will find a massage to suit every budget, from designer spas to at-home mobile massages. Kattan is a fan of both, but enthuses that those looking to splurge can\u2019t go wrong with the Guerlain Spa at the One&Only The Palm hotel found on the tip of the manmade Palm Jumeriah island.\nThe Guerlain Spa features a leafy Arabic courtyard resplendent with regal fountains and a marble lobby with its own mini Guerlain boutique. Kattan was smitten from the moment she first stepped through the door. \"[It's] like a movie. It's amazing,\" she says.\nKattan usually goes for a deep tissue massage, while her husband, Portuguese businessman Christopher Goncalo, prefers the Thai massage technique. Kattan says she used to enjoy Swedish massages, but now she seeks out a sports massage treatment. \"I don't even want the relaxation anymore. I want them to work me out,\" she says. \u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.guerlain.com/ae/en-ae/guerlain-spa-one-and-only-the-palm-dubai.html \n Address: One&Only The Palm West Crescent, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai\n Phone: +971 4 440 1040\n Instagram: @guerlain/\nHammams \u2013 steam-filled public bathhouses \u2013 have been part of Middle Eastern culture as early as the 7th Century, serving not only as a place to wash off the desert sand, but a space to socialise.\nWhile modern plumbing has since been introduced, getting scrubbed clean in a room full of steam is still a hallmark of the Middle Eastern spa experience.\nTip:\n\"It's a very classy society,\" says Kattan. \"People will not look at you if you are dressed a certain way, but [they might] if you're maybe acting a little loud.\" Kattan says that she also had to take it down a notch: \"I'm American; we're very loud and I learned to adjust.\"\nKattan recommends the Talise Ottoman Spa on the West Crescent of The Palm. \"I went on my birthday. It was just the best experience,\" she says.\nThe cleansing ritual at Talise Ottoman Spa takes place in a domed marble room decorated in mosaics, where clients recline on a heated marble bed to have their skin exfoliated with a kese mitt, then revived with their choice of a honey, lavender and mint mask, or one made with purifying rose or gold.\nAfterwards, visitors can relax in one of the private majlis (cabanas) that surround a pool lit by a glittering chandelier. \"You sit there and they bring you a yogurt drink, dates and apricots,\" says Kattan. \"I was, like, I'm sure I'm in the 1600s and I'm a princess.\"\nWebsite: https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/dubai/jumeirah-zabeel-saray/wellbeing/signature-talise-ottoman-spa\n Address: Jumeirah Zabeel Saray, West Crescent, The Palm Jumeirah, Dubai \n Phone: +971 4 453 0455\n Instagram: @jumeirah \nTo truly indulge her senses, Kattan loves visiting fragrance stores.\nBedouins have been crafting seductive fragrances like heady oud from resinous woods or earthy frankincense from the gum of the Boswellia tree for centuries. \"Abdul\u00a0Samad Al Qurashi is I think the most luxurious, and they do really beautiful fragrances,\" says Kattan of the historic Saudi Arabian fragrance house, known for crafting fine fragrances since 1852. \"And Ajmal has a really beautiful store in Dubai Mall.

Getting in and out of it is a nightmare. I would recommend something more central.\" Kattan says that October and March are still great options for cooler months, but if you still want to go during peak season, Kattan jokes: \"Go to a hotel where you don't need to leave.\"\nKattan's go-to beach experience is SAL on the terrace of the seven-star Burj Al Arab Hotel, overlooking the Persian Gulf. \"It has a beautiful and calm setting with an amazing view.

SAL also offers several poolside dining menus, with treats ranging from chilled starters and Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes to decadent desserts, as well as a luxe cocktail list and full shisha bar.

        "article_text": "Train stations were once the centrepieces of many US cities. After decades of neglect, many places are now reviving them in new, creative ways.\nThe trains don't stop at Union Pacific Depot anymore. So a hotel, the Asher Adams, was built within the former train station in Salt Lake City, Utah, and opened in October 2024. Refreshed with white and gilt detailing and long wooden benches interspersed with plush seats, the resulting space pulls a bit of a mind trick: are you lingering in a lobby or waiting for a train to arrive?\nThe Asher Adams is just one of a spate of recently restored train stations across the US that are being reclaimed as hotels, restaurants, museums and more.\nFrom the late 1800s through the 1920s, many of the US's railway barons built grand train stations. These palaces not only testify to the \"golden age of American railroading\", but serve as a reminder of how the rapid growth of rail travel following the US Civil War helped settle the US West and transform the once-largely rural nation to a coast-to-coast collection of cities. As automobiles and, later, planes became more fashionable than trains, many of these railways consolidated or stopped running, leaving these once-bustling centrepieces of urban life empty.\nSome stations burned down. Others were demolished. But over the past decade, cities have been finding creative ways to breathe new life into the historic structures, helping them regain their cultural cachet while offering travellers an intriguing glimpse into the past.\u00a0\nIn the case of Asher Adams, tearing down the Union Pacific Depot wasn't an option. \"The public had an emotional connection to it,\" recalled Emir Tursic, a partner with HKS Architects, which led the restoration. \"It's part of our cultural heritage.\"\nIt's also one of the oldest buildings in Salt Lake City, he noted. Originally built between 1908 and 1909 as a bustling hub to merge multiple railway lines connecting the American North-west and South-west, the brick-and-sandstone structure hadn't been used for as a railway stop for decades. Instead, part of the structure had been converted into office space ahead of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; another wing became a nightclub. \"The rest was abandoned, especially during the pandemic.\"\nWhat made this structure worth preserving? Aside from its emotional pull and landmarked status, Tursic says its sweeping Second Empire architecture, stained-glass windows, terrazzo floors and two large murals on either side of the hall (including Driving the Golden Spike, depicting the completion of the Transcontinental railroad in 1869).\n\"The craftsmanship simply doesn't exist anymore,\" Tursic said. \"It has a significant value that would be impossible to replace.\"\nTursic also believes these revived spaces offer travellers a unique connection to local culture and history. The Asher Adams, for instance, is named after John Asher and John Adams, two cartographers who first mapped railroad routes throughout the West, and as media in Salt Lake have reported, \"almost everything in [it is] a nod to Utah and railroad history\".\n\"Today's travellers have more intellectual curiosity,\" Tursic explained. While a railway station-turned-hotel may not retain its original function, \"both are related to travel, and this gives us a chance to restore the original character and spirit of the structure. It tells a story in itself: you can sit in the Great Hall and it takes you back.\" Not surprisingly, many visitors immediately take out their phones and start taking photos and videos. \"That's what people are looking for: memorable experiences that are really hard to replicate.\"\nA second reason for the reuse boom: location, location, location.\n\"A lot of towns and cities were built up around their train stations,\" said Glenn NP Nowak, associate professor of architecture at UNLV School of Architecture in Las Vegas, Nevada. As result, many of the structures are located in highly desirable areas. These stations were designed as a \"gateway\" to then-burgeoning locales, where travellers would disembark and get their first impressions of the city. As a result, many boast generously arched entryways or tall columns that strategically frame what are now historic downtowns or other attractions.\n\"You had a sense of arrival,\" said Diana Melichar, president of Melichar Architects in Lake Forest, Illinois, and who has renovated several train stations in smaller communities. \"They were the gateways to these 19th- and 20th-Century cities that were growing. Trains were the mode of transportation [and the message was], this is the grand entry to the town.\"\nPerhaps the most expansive example is the recent transformation of Denver's Union Station into a massive hall encompassing a hotel (The Crawford), restaurants and retail spaces. While trains still whisk passengers from the airport to the hotel and the seasonal Winter Park Express train brings travellers and Denverites up to ski country, Union Station is no longer the robust train hub it was in its heyday.\nIt is, however, an awe-inspiring space. In addition to its enormous scale, it abounds with restored historic details \u2013 antique mirrors; subway tiles; the original ticketing office which has been transformed into a bar; and an old barber shop-turned local ice cream purveyor. Built in 1881 in the wake of the Colorado Gold Rush, the structure was remodelled twice; first by urban preservationist Dana Crawford who spearheaded a $38m revitalisation in 2014, followed by another elegant $11m makeover that was unveiled in July 2024.\n\"[Crawford] had a vision to restore Union Station back to its glory days, when there were 80 trains passing through,\" recalled Ed Blair, area general manager of Sage Hospitality Group, parent company to both the hotel and Union Station. Revived as \"Denver's living room\", the renovation has helped lure tourists and locals back to the city's centre.\nToday, it's a light-filled, multi-storey space, drawing creatives tapping on laptops and sipping locally roasted coffee from Pigtrain. Perhaps the best perch is after dark, from the Cooper Lounge on the second-storey mezzanine, where visitors have a birds-eye view of the 1900s domed-glass chandeliers and Manhattans arrive on shiny silver trays.\nA third reason cited for the boom: sustainability. Most train stations were built for the long haul (pun intended), and to withstand the wear and tear of a steady flow of passengers.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Swiss hotel cut off from the world for 12 hours a day\n \u2022 Europe's stunning high-tech luxury train\n \u2022 A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities\n\"Economically and environmentally, it makes a lot of sense to preserve what you have, instead of tearing something down and building up something new,\" Melichar says. \"If they have good bones, these buildings built of stone or brick will last another century.\"\nOf course, not all train stations are palatial. For example, the former Westfield train station in Westfield, New Jersey, about 22 miles west of New York City, is a modestly sized stone-brick building built in 1892 that sits alongside an active commuter rail. Most recently used as office space, it had fallen into disrepair. After a 2.5-year renovation \u2013 which included removing dead birds from the roof \u2013 it re-opened in October 2024 as the Mexican restaurant Maize Cocina & Cocktails.\n\"We could have gotten a vanilla box, or a turn-key restaurant,\" says Jesa Henneberry, partner and executive chef. \"But we didn't want to tear down history. We wanted to breathe new life into it. I feel good we did that here.\"\nNods to the building's roots are sprinkled throughout the restaurant: wooden banquettes are styled like train station-style benches and cushions made from blue-and-white striped fabric evoke vintage train conductor hats. What was once the luggage room has been transformed into the kitchen and the former waiting room is now part of the bar, where visitors queue for margaritas, not train tickets.\nBest of all, visitors can explore most of these new incarnations for free \u2013 or at least for the small price of a drink or museum ticket, as with the case of Cincinnati's Union Terminal, a dazzling Art Deco landmark now home to the Cincinnati History Museum and the Museum of Natural History & Science.\nBut most importantly, developing these historic spaces is about looking at current-day needs, and overlaying that with what the building has to offer, the pros say. A train station waiting room can be adapted into a unique cultural space \u2013 but only if you have an available train station to adapt.\n\"We like to say that you can't build history,\" said Blair.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "As travellers flock to the English countryside to celebrate the renowned novelist, we asked experts to weigh in on the best Austen-themed festivals, reenactments and balls of the year.\nWith bonnets and boarding passes ready, a brigade of Jane Austen fans from around the world is preparing to bombard Britain, eager to celebrate one of English literature's greatest writers throughout 2025 on her 250th birthday.\nFrom the dashing John Willoughby in Sense and Sensibility to the spirited Emma Woodhouse in the eponymous Emma, Austen's characters have enchanted generations of readers, inspiring yearly pilgrimages to her home county of Hampshire and beyond to trace her footsteps. This year, these journeys take on a celebratory air as travellers flock to the English countryside for literary festivals, reenactments and Regency balls designed to pay tribute to the author.\nHere are the year's most ostentatious events, according to Austen experts \u2013 the ones promising fans an unforgettable birthday bash for a writer who presciently wrote, \"One cannot have too large a party.\"\nAlthough her vivid portrayals of English life now epitomise the extravagance of the Georgian era, Austen's own story began modestly. She was born on 16 December 1775, in the village of Steventon, in Hampshire, England, the seventh child and youngest daughter of clergyman George Austen and his wife Cassandra.\n\"It must have been a bustling household, with the large Austen family and the boys her father tutored,\" said Janet Todd, one of Britain's leading Austen scholars. Although the rectory where the Austens lived was demolished in 1824, St Nicholas Church, where they worshipped, still stands. A dedicated team of volunteers is working to ensure every visit to the historic chapel is memorable.\nNot at all bowing to the idea of being the country cousin to the author's more well-known former towns, like Bath and Chawton, Steventon has organised lively events for June, July and December. Visitors can attend the Jane Austen's Words and Music Chamber concert on 8 June\u00a0 at her family's chapel or join a country fair on 6 June held in the same pump field where the Austen's parsonage home once stood. Then, in remembrance, the church will hold a special Thanksgiving Service for Austen on her birthday on 16 December.\nIn Austen's England, balls were pivotal to social life and courtship among the middle and upper classes. For Zack Pinsent, a 29-year-old tailor known for exclusively wearing Regency-era attire, attending a ball is the ultimate tribute to Austen. This year's calendar is packed with options, from a Regency Week Ball in Alton this June to a Yuletide Birthday Ball in Bath come December. However, Pinsent recommends the Brighton Royal Grand Pavilion Ball on January 25, which he is organising and has already drawn attendees from 16 countries.\n\"Anyone can attend, as long as they have the right outfit,\" said Pinsent, who has secured the Royal Pavilion for the eponymous Regency-inspired event.\nBrighton's Royal Pavilion, built by George IV, Austen's contemporary and admirer, hosted extravagant balls in its heyday. Though there's no evidence Austen ever visited, Pinsent speculates she may have, given Brighton's influence on her imagination. The seaside town even earned a mention in Pride and Prejudice, when Austen wrote of Lydia Bennet: \"At Brighton, she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\"\nAusten set two of her novels, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, in Bath, but her feelings about the resort town remain debated. Her famously dramatic reaction to her family's move there from Steventon \u2013 she allegedly fainted \u2013 hints at reluctance. Still, during her years in Bath (1801-1806), its vibrant social scene, from galas at Sydney Gardens to events at the Assembly Rooms, inspired her work. However, personal tragedy, including her father's death during this time, likely influenced her perception of the city.\n\"The party line is, we don't really know how she felt about Bath,\" said Georgia Delve, director of the Jane Austen Centre Festival (held 12-21 September in Bath). \"But I think in terms of her storyline and the characters, you walk around the city, and it's all written in the stone: you get Bennett Street, you've got Bartlett Street, you've got the Assembly Rooms, you've got the Royal Crescent, you've got the Paragon, you know, great Pulteney Street. All these places come up in her letters and novels.\"\nBath's enduring love for Austen is clear, exemplified by its Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of people in Regency costumes. This year's Austen Festival begins with a grand promenade, drawing fans worldwide.\nBeyond the festival, the Jane Austen Centre is hosting two summer Regency balls, including a Persuasion-themed Nautical Ball on 31 May and a unique Sanditon-inspired event based on Austen's unfinished novel of the same name on 28 June. The event will include dance workshops to master waltzes and cotillions.\nThe port city of Southampton played a role in Austen's life on three occasions \u2013 an often-overlooked fact that the town is hoping to rectify this year. She briefly attended boarding school there, celebrated her 18th birthday at the city's historic Dolphin Hotel, and later stayed there with her brother after departing Bath. To honour the city's deep ties, Southampton plans to display her travel writing desk now through \u200b\u200b23 February at God's House Tower, on loan from the British Library as part of the exhibit In Training for a Heroine. The portable mahogany desk was a gift from her father, and on it, she wrote what she referred to as \"My own darling child,\" the first draft of Pride and Prejudice. Tickets are free, but visitors must reserve a time to see the installation.\nAccording to Todd, much of Austen's enduring appeal lies in her connection to a romanticised England. Hampshire, where she lived, wrote, and set many of her novels, preserved its charm by avoiding industrialisation. This timeless quality makes a visit to the author's former home in Chawton, now called Jane Austen's House, a uniquely transportive experience. After her father's death left Jane, her sister and their mother nearly penniless, with only \u00a3210 a year, according to Todd, Jane's brother Edward eventually moved them into his cottage in 1809. It was here, in this idyllic setting, that Jane refined her six novels.\nMore like this:\n \u2022 What Jane Austen can teach us about resilience\n \u2022 Britain's greatest natural wonders to explore in the wintertime\n \u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\nTo celebrate the writer's 250th birthday, the Jane Austen House hosts a Pride and Prejudice Festival from 23-28 January, featuring Austenmania, a year-long exhibit dedicated to her posthumous cinematic legacy. The site has also launched a permanent exhibition, Jane Austen and the Art of Writing, showcasing her creative process and first editions of her works. \"It's quite moving to be in there with them,\" said 15-year docent Janie McShane of the priceless tomes. For many visitors, that's the real allure, to see how Austen lived, \"to tread,\" McShane said, \"where she tread\".\nAusten was an enthusiastic walker. In a world where a woman's life was nearly always spent supervised or in the company of family and friends, taking a stroll likely meant freedom and escape. \"Austen's characters walk to be themselves and to change,\" writes Rachel Cohen in Austen Years: A Memoir in Five Novels. \nPat Lerew, chair of the Jane Austen Alton Group, says her village will give visitors the same opportunity. Alton is reasonably short stroll from Austen's House. \"We know Jane and her sister walked into Alton two or three times a week to shop or visit with friends,\" Lerew said. \"She would also pick up the coach here to go to London.\" Similarly, the 10-day Jane Austen Regency Week (20-29 June) will include a Regency Day with stalls and entertainment guests can peruse, followed by a ribbon cutting on a new public Jane Austen Garden.\nThe final chapter of Jane's life was tragic. At 41, she fell ill with a mysterious condition that modern experts have speculated may have been Addison's disease or Hodgkin lymphoma. Her deteriorating condition required a move from Chawton cottage to Winchester to seek specialised care. Jane and her sister Cassandra took up residence at No. 8 College Street, a property now owned by Winchester College, a historic boarding school attended by eight of Austen's nephews. This summer, for the first time ever, the school is opening the apartments to the public.\n\"The apartment remains strikingly similar to how it was in Austen's time,\" said Richard Foster, the Fellows' Librarian and Keeper of Collections at the college, who has played a key role in organising the opening. \"Austen describes a neat little drawing room with a bay window overlooking the headmaster's garden, and those features are still intact.\" It was in this space that Austen penned her final poem, and from the same bay window, Cassandra watched her sister's funeral procession \u2013 restricted by 19th-Century customs that barred women from attending.\nTickets for this limited-time opening are available online. Visitors can also honour Austen at her final resting place in the north nave of Winchester Cathedral. Her simple gravestone, devoid of any mention of her literary brilliance, seems almost ironic \u2013 a fact Austen herself might have found darkly amusing. The modest epitaph only nods to the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", a description she might have skewered with her signature wit. After all, as she once wrote, \"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

The site has also launched a permanent exhibition, Jane Austen and the Art of Writing, showcasing her creative process and first editions of her works. \"It's quite moving to be in there with them,\" said 15-year docent Janie McShane of the priceless tomes. For many visitors, that's the real allure, to see how Austen lived, \"to tread,\" McShane said, \"where she tread\".\nAusten was an enthusiastic walker. In a world where a woman's life was nearly always spent supervised or in the company of family and friends, taking a stroll likely meant freedom and escape. \"Austen's characters walk to be themselves and to change,\" writes Rachel Cohen in Austen Years: A Memoir in Five Novels. \nPat Lerew, chair of the Jane Austen Alton Group, says her village will give visitors the same opportunity. Alton is reasonably short stroll from Austen's House. \"We know Jane and her sister walked into Alton two or three times a week to shop or visit with friends,\" Lerew said. \"She would also pick up the coach here to go to London.\" Similarly, the 10-day Jane Austen Regency Week (20-29 June) will include a Regency Day with stalls and entertainment guests can peruse, followed by a ribbon cutting on a new public Jane Austen Garden.\nThe final chapter of Jane's life was tragic. At 41, she fell ill with a mysterious condition that modern experts have speculated may have been Addison's disease or Hodgkin lymphoma. Her deteriorating condition required a move from Chawton cottage to Winchester to seek specialised care. Jane and her sister Cassandra took up residence at No. 8 College Street, a property now owned by Winchester College, a historic boarding school attended by eight of Austen's nephews. This summer, for the first time ever, the school is opening the apartments to the public.\n\"The apartment remains strikingly similar to how it was in Austen's time,\" said Richard Foster, the Fellows' Librarian and Keeper of Collections at the college, who has played a key role in organising the opening. \"Austen describes a neat little drawing room with a bay window overlooking the headmaster's garden, and those features are still intact.\" It was in this space that Austen penned her final poem, and from the same bay window, Cassandra watched her sister's funeral procession \u2013 restricted by 19th-Century customs that barred women from attending.\nTickets for this limited-time opening are available online. Visitors can also honour Austen at her final resting place in the north nave of Winchester Cathedral. Her simple gravestone, devoid of any mention of her literary brilliance, seems almost ironic \u2013 a fact Austen herself might have found darkly amusing. The modest epitaph only nods to the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", a description she might have skewered with her signature wit. After all, as she once wrote, \"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Kate Bush wrote her chart-topping debut single when she was just 18 years old. She told the BBC about the origins of a literary love song that began a unique career in music.\nKate Bush's debut single, Wuthering Heights, was theatrical, undeniably eccentric, and utterly unlike the punk, new wave, prog rock and disco music that dominated the UK charts when it was released 47 years ago this week. And yet the single became an unexpected number one hit in 1978 \u2013 the first song written and performed by a female artist to reach the UK top spot. What makes the single even more idiosyncratic is that its title and story are borrowed from Emily Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel \u2013 but it was actually a television series that spurred Bush to write the song.\n\"Well, I hadn't read the book, that wasn't what inspired it. It was a television series they had years ago,\" she told Michael Aspel in a BBC interview in 1978. As a teenager she had come across the end of an episode of a 1967 BBC adaptation of Bront\u00eb's tale of doomed love. Its startling imagery had captivated her. \"I just managed to catch the very last few minutes where there was a hand coming through the window and blood everywhere and glass. And I just didn't know what was going on and someone explained the story.\"\nBush was just 19 years old when the single was released. Although she may have seemed precocious to the public, she had been writing songs for years. Born in July 1958, the youngest of three children, she grew up in an artistic household in Kent, England. Her father, a doctor, and her mother, a nurse, surrounded their children with music, and encouraged them to learn instruments from an early age. Both of her older brothers were heavily involved in music and poetry, and she would join them performing Irish and English folk songs at home. \"My brothers are very musical, yes. They were really responsible for turning me onto it in the first place. They were always playing music when I was a kid,\" she told Aspel.\nBush began to compose her own songs in her early teens, recording them on homemade demo tapes. One of these tapes found its way via a family friend into the hands of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, who recognised the promise in her songwriting and was particularly taken with the otherworldly quality of her voice. \"I was intrigued by this strange voice,\" he told BBC podcast Profile in 2022. \"I went to her house, met her parents down in Kent, and she played me, God, it must have been 40 or 50 songs.\"\u00a0\nGilmour re-recorded three of Bush's songs with her in his studio for a new demo, and then encouraged Pink Floyd's record label, EMI, to sign her at the age of 16. As Bush was still at school, she spent the first two years of her contract continuing with her studies, while using the record company's advance to enrol in interpretive dance classes with mime artist and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, who had previously taught a young David Bowie.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\n\"I've definitely been influenced by Lindsay Kemp because he's one of my heroes and he was my teacher for a while,\" she told Aspel. \"Marcel Marceau, I admire his stuff, but it is a little too staid for me. It's the art of illusion. It's not really the actual showing of emotion, which is what Lindsay teaches, and for me that's perfect because that's what music in any form of art is about. It's emotion, it's from inside.\"\u00a0\nAt the same time, she was also honing her musical craft. She formed a group called the KT Bush Band and began playing in London pubs while working on songs for her debut album, The Kick Inside. The singer told the BBC that she tended to compose these songs late in the evening. \"It seems to be the time of day that things gather, you know. I wake up about 11pm, I'm sort of sleepy all day, then at 11pm I really wake up.\" One night when she was 18, she sat down at the piano to write a song from the perspective of Bront\u00eb's passionate, conflicted heroine, Catherine Earnshaw, who haunts her lover Heathcliff, both during her life and after she dies. The imagery from the Wuthering Heights TV adaptation \"was just hanging around for years\", she said, \"so I read the book in order to get the research right\".\nThe song's lyrics evoke Catherine's obsessive longing for Heathcliff, her mercurial nature, and the couple's charged, destructive relationship. Bush also wanted to convey Catherine's ghostly presence, so she adopted high-pitched, keening vocals to give the song an eerie, haunting air. \"It was really specifically for that song, it was that high because of the subject matter,\" she said. \"I'm playing Cathy and she was a spirit, and it needed some kind of ethereal effect, and it seemed to be the best way to do it, to get a high register.\"\u00a0\nWuthering Heights, with its lush, sweeping orchestration, its literary sensibilities, and Bush's soaring theatrical delivery, did not strike her record company as an obvious radio hit. EMI instead wanted the rockier sounding James and the Cold Gun, a favourite from her KT Bush Band's pub set, to be the first single from the album. But Bush was adamant that Wuthering Heights should be her debut \u2013 and EMI eventually relented.\u00a0\nTo accompany its release, two music videos were filmed. One was\u00a0studio-based\u00a0and the other was shot\u00a0outside, with Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, standing in for the novel's windswept Yorkshire moors. For the shoots, Bush used the interpretive dance instruction she had received to mesmerising effect. Both videos feature her gazing intensely at the camera, clad in floaty dresses while performing dramatic and emotive dance movements to express the spectral essence of Cathy. Her dance routine was so distinctive that it became something of a cultural touchstone, inspiring both\u00a0comedic homages\u00a0and an\u00a0annual event\u00a0called The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever, at which Bush devotees recreate her performance from the videos.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eartha Kitt: from 'extreme poverty' to stardom\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\n\u2022\u00a0How a child star saved a Hollywood studio\nThe single would prove to be her breakthrough. Within three weeks of being released, it had reached number one, getting a boost from Bush's arresting mime-style performance on the BBC's music chart show,\u00a0Top of the Pops. It knocked Abba's Take a Chance on Me off the UK singles chart's top spot, and stayed there for a month. It also topped the charts in Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Australia. Her album, The Kick Inside, when it was released the following month, sold more than one million copies. She would go on to collect an Ivor Novello award in 1979 for The Man with The Child in His Eyes, released as her second single from the album.\nWuthering Heights marked the start of Bush's innovative, critically acclaimed and shape-shifting musical career. She has now released a total of 10 studio albums, melding diverse influences, complex musical storytelling and new technologies, such as sampling, to spawn hit singles like Hounds of Love and Babooshka. She has also collaborated with artists including Prince and Elton John. Her duet with Peter Gabriel, Don't Give Up, would pick up another Ivor Novello award in 1987.\nIn 2022, Bush reached a whole new generation of fans when her 1985 hit Running Up That Hill started trending on TikTok, after being used in the Netflix series Stranger Things. It gave Bush her first top 10 hit in the US and reached number one in the UK charts, 44 years after her debut single. \"It's just extraordinary,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in 2022. \"It's such a great series. I thought that the track would get some attention. But I just never imagined that it would be anything like this.\"\nAt the time of her appearance on Michael Aspel's show in 1978, she was already working on her second studio album, Lionheart, and preparing to tour her music with what would be a lavish stage show called The Tour of Life. The performances embraced the theatricality of Bush's songs, featuring dance, poetry, mime and magic, with the singer making multiple costume changes and pioneering the use of a headset microphone on stage. \"I've always wanted to be involved in music,\" Bush told Aspel. \"I never thought I would be able to sing them, to sing my songs, but it seems that I have done it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Greenlandic politician and Inuit educator Aleqa Hammond shares her top ways to experience the country, from sampling Greenlandic cuisine to viewing the Northern Lights in Ilulissat.\nAt a staggering 2.16 million sq km, Greenland is the world's largest island \u2013 and its least densely populated. A colossal ice sheet covers roughly 80% of its mass; most of the population (56,000) lives in urban areas along its south-west coast.\u00a0\nThe Specialist\nAleqa Hammond is a politician and former member of the Greenland Parliament. Her political career began in 2005 when she held various ministerial roles, including Minister of Finances and Foreign Affairs. In 2013, she became Greenland's first female Prime Minister.\nBut Greenland still attracts visitors with its stunning natural backdrop of glaciers and icebergs. Adventurers enjoy kayaking, hiking and dog sledding in the vast wilderness. The midnight sun, Northern Lights and colourful villages only add to this Arctic destination's allure.\nWe asked Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister (2013-2014), how to explore this land of contrasts. \"Greenland is so vast and huge and undiscovered in many ways that after the Ilulissat Icefjord received a World Heritage site designation in 2004, it was not recognised by Unesco again for another 13 years,\" she says. \"It has three now, which shows that the country has so much to offer.\"\nIn November 2024, Nuuk International Airport opened in the country's capital. And in 2026, two more international airports will open \u2013 in Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest city, and Qaqortoq, in southern Greenland. As Greenlanders prepare for an influx of visitors, Hammond is optimistic. \"Everybody wants this change because we want to have a stronger economy, and we want to be more self-sufficient.\"\nAccording to the Greenlandic Ministry of Business, Trade, Mineral Resources, Justice and Gender Equality, over the past five years, tourism in Greenland has grown by 46%; primarily due to a surge in demand from travellers eager to explore new destinations after Covid-19 \u2013 particularly those with wide-open spaces. The numbers are expected to rise with the new airports.\nBut \"Greenland does not want mass tourism,\" says Hammond. \"Greenland wants better tourism. We want tourism that's to the benefit of the people of this country, not to overwhelm us. It's going to be a very controlled place, and that makes it special.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hammond's favourite ways to experience Greenland.\nNuuk, Greenland's capital, is home to approximately 20,000 residents. But \"it's very much a metropolitan city\", says Hammond. \"There's museums, there's cafes, there's so many shopping opportunities and concerts, it's so alive.\"\nLocated in Nuuk's Colonial Harbour, the Greenland National Museum & Archives is a fascinating place to delve into the country's history and culture. \"The museum is absolutely worth visiting,\" Hammond says. \"It's well organised and it's doing a lot of archaeological excavations in remote places in Greenland.\"\nThe best of 2025\nGreenland was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list\u00a0here.\nThe museum's exhibitions cover a vast span of Greenland's history, from the first Paleo-Eskimo cultures that arrived thousands of years ago to a period of Norse settlement in the 10th Century and Thule migration in the 13th Century, followed by Danish colonisation in the 18th Century.\nThe museum is also known for its collection of well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies \u2013 the naturally mummified remains of a family from Northern Greenland's Paleo-Eskimo Saqqaq culture, who lived sometime between 2500 BCE to 800 BCE. \"They are the oldest mummies in the world of Inuit heritage,\" says Hammond, who is Inuit as well as a respected Inuit educator and former commissioner of the\u00a0Inuit Circumpolar Council.\u00a0\"These mummies were found in 1972 in the Uummannaq area of North Greenland, where I'm from.\"\nExhibiting the mummies hasn't been without controversy. \"It was a big discussion back then whether they should belong to a museum or not, and a lot of Greenlanders were not very happy that they ended up there,\" Hammond says. \"Today, everybody's satisfied because [of] world interest on how the Inuit have been living and are living, and what cultural heritage we have. This is the oldest proof.\"\nWebsite:\u00a0https://en.nka.gl/\nAddress: Hans Egedesvej 8, Box 145, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 32 26 11\nInstagram:\u00a0@natmus_gl\nWhen it comes to fine dining in Nuuk, one of Hammond's favourites is Restaurant Sarfalik, which is located on the top floor of the upscale Hotel Hans Egede in the city centre. Sarfalik specialises in showcasing the best of Greenlandic cuisine, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced from local hunters and fishermen. A blend of Inuit tradition and survival, cooking techniques include drying, fermenting and smoking.\n\"Using local ingredients is a trend in Greenland,\" Hammond says. \"We have such great resources, and each town has its own open fish and meat market with a choice of musk ox, reindeer, halibut and cod. Everything is there.\"\nSarfalik has an open layout with a cosy brasserie feel, and the menu features traditional Greenlandic fare with a modern twist as well as internationally inspired creations. There's also a tasting menu that allows for sampling various entrees. \"It's not enormous plates, but very beautiful and wonderfully made,\" Hammond says. \"It's a gastronomic experience.\"\nWebsite: https://hhe.gl/restaurant-sarfalik/?lang=en\nAddress: Hotel Hans Egede, Aqqusinersuaq 1 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 34 80 00\nInstagram: @sarfalik\nA significant cultural hub, Nuuk Art Museum features a mix of Greenlandic and international art. \"Because we have many artists in Nuuk, it's very well-visited, and it's a big museum that's absolutely worth a trip,\" says Hammond.\nA gift from Danish-Greenlandic philanthropists Svend and Helene Junge Pedersen to the people of Nuuk, the museum is situated in city centre in a former Adventist church, striking for its high ceilings, wooden beams and stained-glass windows. In addition to exhibitions, the museum also hosts events, workshops and educational programmes, such as an art walk around the city that can be downloaded as a podcast.\nIts primary focus is to showcase the work of Greenlandic artists and the depiction of Greenland in art. This includes a significant number of works by early 20th-Century landscape artist Emanuel A Petersen, known for his romanticised portrayals of Greenlandic nature. The museum's exhibits showcase a variety of media, including paintings, watercolours, drawings and sculptures made from materials like soapstone, ivory and wood.\n\"Greenlandic art is an expression of Inuit culture, which is deeply connected to the land, wildlife and Arctic traditions,\" Hammond says. \"Our spirits, legends, and traditional beliefs are also often depicted, as well as animals important for survival like seals, whales and polar bears.\"\nWebsite: https://www.nuukkunstmuseum.com/\nAddress: Kissarneqqortuunnguaq 5, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 36 60 33\nInstagram: @nuukartmuseum\nDepending on the time of year, the Northern Lights are literally all around. \"It's like trees,\" Hammond says. \"You don't really notice them unless one specific tree is really beautiful. We don't have trees here, but there's a lot of Northern Lights.\"\nTip\nTo view Greenland's Northern Lights, \"from September until February is a perfect time\", says Hammond. \"Greenland has long, dark nights during this period, and clearer skies compared to other seasons. When we know that there's going to be a very good Northern Lights night, we put on a lot of clothes, bring our tea and take a hike around the village. Then we just sit there and enjoy it. And nobody says a word for a very long time, because this beauty is so much more than 1,000 words.\"\nDespite their frequent occurrence, the Northern Lights are also a reminder of Hammond's heritage, so she never takes them for granted.\n\"The Northern Lights have both entertainment and cultural value,\" she says. \"We know who they are \u2013 that's our ancestors, and that's why we love watching them. We honour our ancestors a lot, and we can always see them in our environment. In Greenland, you can see them in the sky.\"\nWitnessing the Northern Lights is especially meaningful at the Ilulissat Icefjord, a deep sea inlet filled with massive icebergs. A Unesco World Heritage site, it is one of the fastest moving and most active glaciers in the world, moving around 40m per day.\n\"It's very easy to walk out to the Icefjord at night because there's a boardwalk and you can take it out to a bench with the best view in the world,\" Hammond says. \"Sit on that bench and you'll be right in front of the icebergs. The Northern Lights give a special light to the icefjord, and the icebergs get another glow, another colour. It's the ultimate Northern Lights experience.\"\nLocated on the west coast, Ilulissat is about 250km north of the Arctic Circle. Historically a fishing village, it is also known for its sled dogs. The Icefjord is a short bus ride from town and the boardwalk is easily accessible as it extends from the car park.\nThe Ilulissat Icefjord Centre is situated on the edge of the icefjord and provides interactive displays, artefacts and scientific data.\nWebsite:\u00a0https://isfjordscentret.gl/en/ilulissat-icefjord-centre/\nAddress: Sermermiut Aqqutaa B 2089, 3952 Ilulissat\nPhone: +299 55 55 88\nInstagram:\u00a0@ilulissat_isfjordscentret\nGreenland is as famous for its epic wildlife as it is for its stunning Northern Lights. Depending on the region, you might see reindeer, musk oxen, polar bears, Arctic foxes and a variety of whales \u2013 including elusive narwhals with their unicorn-like tusks.\nHammond suggests admiring the island's wildlife via both land and sea by combining a city break with an expedition cruise like Adventure Canada, which offers six Greenland itineraries with plans to expand to East Greenland in 2025.\nThe best chance to spot polar bears is in East Greenland because, according to Hammond, \"the big impact of the North Pole ice melting is that they are all going that way\". Arctic wildlife \u2013 both marine and mammal \u2013 can be spotted via a small ship cruise or by hiking the Arctic Circle Trail. Because polar bears are powerful predators, observing them from a ship provides a safe vantage point and minimises risks. Arctic cruises are the best ways to spot marine wildlife, especially whales, seals and walruses.\n\"Fly into Greenland first, and then take your own trip, maybe from Nuuk to Ilulissat or vice versa, and go on from there,\" she says. \"You can come in a few days ahead of time and experience the authentic Greenland for yourself by partaking in activities like hiking before you embark on the cruise. Greenland has incredible hiking trails, and the further you venture into the wilderness, the more likely you are to encounter animals.\"\nWebsite: https://www.adventurecanada.com/\nPhone: +1 800 363 7566\nInstagram: @adventure.canada\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Greenlandic politician and Inuit educator Aleqa Hammond shares her top ways to experience the country, from sampling Greenlandic cuisine to viewing the Northern Lights in Ilulissat.\nAt a staggering 2.16 million sq km, Greenland is the world's largest island \u2013 and its least densely populated. A colossal ice sheet covers roughly 80% of its mass; most of the population (56,000) lives in urban areas along its south-west coast.\u00a0\nThe Specialist\nAleqa Hammond is a politician and former member of the Greenland Parliament. Her political career began in 2005 when she held various ministerial roles, including Minister of Finances and Foreign Affairs. In 2013, she became Greenland's first female Prime Minister.\nBut Greenland still attracts visitors with its stunning natural backdrop of glaciers and icebergs. Adventurers enjoy kayaking, hiking and dog sledding in the vast wilderness. The midnight sun, Northern Lights and colourful villages only add to this Arctic destination's allure.\nWe asked Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister (2013-2014), how to explore this land of contrasts. \"Greenland is so vast and huge and undiscovered in many ways that after the Ilulissat Icefjord received a World Heritage site designation in 2004, it was not recognised by Unesco again for another 13 years,\" she says. \"It has three now, which shows that the country has so much to offer.\"\nIn November 2024, Nuuk International Airport opened in the country's capital. And in 2026, two more international airports will open \u2013 in Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest city, and Qaqortoq, in southern Greenland. As Greenlanders prepare for an influx of visitors, Hammond is optimistic. \"Everybody wants this change because we want to have a stronger economy, and we want to be more self-sufficient.\"\nAccording to the Greenlandic Ministry of Business, Trade, Mineral Resources, Justice and Gender Equality, over the past five years, tourism in Greenland has grown by 46%; primarily due to a surge in demand from travellers eager to explore new destinations after Covid-19 \u2013 particularly those with wide-open spaces. The numbers are expected to rise with the new airports.\nBut \"Greenland does not want mass tourism,\" says Hammond. \"Greenland wants better tourism. We want tourism that's to the benefit of the people of this country, not to overwhelm us. It's going to be a very controlled place, and that makes it special.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hammond's favourite ways to experience Greenland.\nNuuk, Greenland's capital, is home to approximately 20,000 residents. But \"it's very much a metropolitan city\", says Hammond. \"There's museums, there's cafes, there's so many shopping opportunities and concerts, it's so alive.\"\nLocated in Nuuk's Colonial Harbour, the Greenland National Museum & Archives is a fascinating place to delve into the country's history and culture. \"The museum is absolutely worth visiting,\" Hammond says. \"It's well organised and it's doing a lot of archaeological excavations in remote places in Greenland.\"\nThe best of 2025\nGreenland was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list\u00a0here.\nThe museum's exhibitions cover a vast span of Greenland's history, from the first Paleo-Eskimo cultures that arrived thousands of years ago to a period of Norse settlement in the 10th Century and Thule migration in the 13th Century, followed by Danish colonisation in the 18th Century.\nThe museum is also known for its collection of well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies \u2013 the naturally mummified remains of a family from Northern Greenland's Paleo-Eskimo Saqqaq culture, who lived sometime between 2500 BCE to 800 BCE. \"They are the oldest mummies in the world of Inuit heritage,\" says Hammond, who is Inuit as well as a respected Inuit educator and former commissioner of the\u00a0Inuit Circumpolar Council.\u00a0\"These mummies were found in 1972 in the Uummannaq area of North Greenland, where I'm from.\"\nExhibiting the mummies hasn't been without controversy. \"It was a big discussion back then whether they should belong to a museum or not, and a lot of Greenlanders were not very happy that they ended up there,\" Hammond says. \"Today, everybody's satisfied because [of] world interest on how the Inuit have been living and are living, and what cultural heritage we have. This is the oldest proof.\"\nWebsite:\u00a0https://en.nka.gl/\nAddress: Hans Egedesvej 8, Box 145, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 32 26 11\nInstagram:\u00a0@natmus_gl\nWhen it comes to fine dining in Nuuk, one of Hammond's favourites is Restaurant Sarfalik, which is located on the top floor of the upscale Hotel Hans Egede in the city centre. Sarfalik specialises in showcasing the best of Greenlandic cuisine, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced from local hunters and fishermen. A blend of Inuit tradition and survival, cooking techniques include drying, fermenting and smoking.\n\"Using local ingredients is a trend in Greenland,\" Hammond says. \"We have such great resources, and each town has its own open fish and meat market with a choice of musk ox, reindeer, halibut and cod. Everything is there.\"\nSarfalik has an open layout with a cosy brasserie feel, and the menu features traditional Greenlandic fare with a modern twist as well as internationally inspired creations. There's also a tasting menu that allows for sampling various entrees. \"It's not enormous plates, but very beautiful and wonderfully made,\" Hammond says. \"It's a gastronomic experience.\"\nWebsite: https://hhe.gl/restaurant-sarfalik/?lang=en\nAddress: Hotel Hans Egede, Aqqusinersuaq 1 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 34 80 00\nInstagram: @sarfalik\nA significant cultural hub, Nuuk Art Museum features a mix of Greenlandic and international art. \"Because we have many artists in Nuuk, it's very well-visited, and it's a big museum that's absolutely worth a trip,\" says Hammond.\nA gift from Danish-Greenlandic philanthropists Svend and Helene Junge Pedersen to the people of Nuuk, the museum is situated in city centre in a former Adventist church, striking for its high ceilings, wooden beams and stained-glass windows. In addition to exhibitions, the museum also hosts events, workshops and educational programmes, such as an art walk around the city that can be downloaded as a podcast.\nIts primary focus is to showcase the work of Greenlandic artists and the depiction of Greenland in art. This includes a significant number of works by early 20th-Century landscape artist Emanuel A Petersen, known for his romanticised portrayals of Greenlandic nature. The museum's exhibits showcase a variety of media, including paintings, watercolours, drawings and sculptures made from materials like soapstone, ivory and wood.\n\"Greenlandic art is an expression of Inuit culture, which is deeply connected to the land, wildlife and Arctic traditions,\" Hammond says. \"Our spirits, legends, and traditional beliefs are also often depicted, as well as animals important for survival like seals, whales and polar bears.\"\nWebsite: https://www.nuukkunstmuseum.com/\nAddress: Kissarneqqortuunnguaq 5, 3900 Nuuk\nPhone: +299 36 60 33\nInstagram: @nuukartmuseum\nDepending on the time of year, the Northern Lights are literally all around. \"It's like trees,\" Hammond says. \"You don't really notice them unless one specific tree is really beautiful. We don't have trees here, but there's a lot of Northern Lights.\"\nTip\nTo view Greenland's Northern Lights, \"from September until February is a perfect time\", says Hammond. \"Greenland has long, dark nights during this period, and clearer skies compared to other seasons. When we know that there's going to be a very good Northern Lights night, we put on a lot of clothes, bring our tea and take a hike around the village. Then we just sit there and enjoy it. And nobody says a word for a very long time, because this beauty is so much more than 1,000 words.\"\nDespite their frequent occurrence, the Northern Lights are also a reminder of Hammond's heritage, so she never takes them for granted.\n\"The Northern Lights have both entertainment and cultural value,\" she says. \"We know who they are \u2013 that's our ancestors, and that's why we love watching them. We honour our ancestors a lot, and we can always see them in our environment. In Greenland, you can see them in the sky.\"\nWitnessing the Northern Lights is especially meaningful at the Ilulissat Icefjord, a deep sea inlet filled with massive icebergs. A Unesco World Heritage site, it is one of the fastest moving and most active glaciers in the world, moving around 40m per day.\n\"It's very easy to walk out to the Icefjord at night because there's a boardwalk and you can take it out to a bench with the best view in the world,\" Hammond says. \"Sit on that bench and you'll be right in front of the icebergs. The Northern Lights give a special light to the icefjord, and the icebergs get another glow, another colour. It's the ultimate Northern Lights experience.\"\nLocated on the west coast, Ilulissat is about 250km north of the Arctic Circle. Historically a fishing village, it is also known for its sled dogs. The Icefjord is a short bus ride from town and the boardwalk is easily accessible as it extends from the car park.\nThe Ilulissat Icefjord Centre is situated on the edge of the icefjord and provides interactive displays, artefacts and scientific data.\nWebsite:\u00a0https://isfjordscentret.gl/en/ilulissat-icefjord-centre/\nAddress: Sermermiut Aqqutaa B 2089, 3952 Ilulissat\nPhone: +299 55 55 88\nInstagram:\u00a0@ilulissat_isfjordscentret\nGreenland is as famous for its epic wildlife as it is for its stunning Northern Lights. Depending on the region, you might see reindeer, musk oxen, polar bears, Arctic foxes and a variety of whales \u2013 including elusive narwhals with their unicorn-like tusks.\nHammond suggests admiring the island's wildlife via both land and sea by combining a city break with an expedition cruise like Adventure Canada, which offers six Greenland itineraries with plans to expand to East Greenland in 2025.\nThe best chance to spot polar bears is in East Greenland because, according to Hammond, \"the big impact of the North Pole ice melting is that they are all going that way\". Arctic wildlife \u2013 both marine and mammal \u2013 can be spotted via a small ship cruise or by hiking the Arctic Circle Trail. Because polar bears are powerful predators, observing them from a ship provides a safe vantage point and minimises risks. Arctic cruises are the best ways to spot marine wildlife, especially whales, seals and walruses.\n\"Fly into Greenland first, and then take your own trip, maybe from Nuuk to Ilulissat or vice versa, and go on from there,\" she says. \"You can come in a few days ahead of time and experience the authentic Greenland for yourself by partaking in activities like hiking before you embark on the cruise. Greenland has incredible hiking trails, and the further you venture into the wilderness, the more likely you are to encounter animals.\"\nWebsite: https://www.adventurecanada.com/\nPhone: +1 800 363 7566\nInstagram: @adventure.canada\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "With her sultry drawl and feline charisma, the singer and actor oozed sophistication. But Eartha Kitt, who was born on 17 January 1927, had the toughest of childhoods. In History looks at how she transcended her troubled beginnings to become a star of stage and screen \u2013 and the first black Catwoman.\nCelebrated by Orson Welles as the \"most exciting woman in the world\", and smeared by the CIA as a \"sadistic nymphomaniac\", Eartha Kitt had an extraordinary life and career. After joining Katherine Dunham's pioneering African-American dance company, she was on Broadway by the age of 19, and went on to become a cabaret sensation in London and Paris. Her smouldering 1950s performances of songs such as Santa Baby, Just an Old-Fashioned Girl and I Want to be Evil have never been bettered. In 1967, she wowed mainstream television audiences as Catwoman in the third series of the camp classic Batman. Later, she won a new generation of fans as the villain Yzma in Disney's 2000 cartoon The Emperor's New Groove. She died on Christmas Day in 2008, aged 81.\nBorn Eartha Mae Keith on a South Carolina cotton plantation on 17 January 1927, she had a start in life that could hardly have been more difficult. She never knew her father, and her mother left her to be raised by various relatives. Speaking on BBC Wales' Late Call in 1971, she said: \"I remember at times when we didn't have anything to eat for what seemed like an insurmountable amount of time. We had to rely on the forest and whatever we could dig out of the ground, such as weeds or a grass I remember that had a kind of onion growing at the bottom of it. And when we could find things like that to eat then we were alright.\"\nDescribing her childhood self as an \"urchin\", she said: \"I'm very glad that she will always be a part of me because she helps me do what she knows I have to do out there on that stage.\"\nDespite being such a confident and poised performer, raw emotion was never far from the surface when Kitt was interviewed, as shown when Ronnie Williams, the host of Late Call, read her one of her quotes: \"You said, 'My mother gave me away at the age of five, and if my mother gives me away, she doesn't want me. So why should anybody want me?'\" Kitt replied that because of this abandonment, she had always lived with the feeling \"that the most important person in the world didn't want you\". She added: \"I think there are many explanations I can make for my mother giving me away and I think that, even though I have tried to explain within myself as to why she gave me away, it's still very difficult for me to accept it.\"\nDecades later, Kitt's beloved daughter Kitt Shapiro revealed that the singer died without knowing the identity of her white father. She told the Observer in 2013 that her mother wept when she finally saw her birth certificate, only to discover that the man's name had been blanked out by officials to protect his reputation in the segregated American South.\nBecause of her mixed heritage, Kitt told Williams on Late Call that she was not accepted by the black community. She said: \"They don't understand that I don't think of myself in terms of being a black person. I think of myself as being a person who belongs to everybody, but I think one should always feel this way. I think that, as long as you are feeling in terms of belonging only to one race, one nationality, one religion, that you have to be prejudiced\u2026 I am an illegitimate child, and at the same time I was not of completely black parentage. My father was supposedly a Caucasian, and my grandparents are Cherokee Indians. My mother was half black and all of this, and therefore my blood is of yours and of anybody's and therefore I've always thought of myself as this, and to be prejudiced against any of the other bloods is rather silly to me.\"\nIN HISTORY\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nAccording to Kitt, her travels had convinced her that financial inequality was at the root of so much prejudice around the world: \"When we are able to recognise that no matter what colour or religion you belong to, that you are capable of gaining as much as the next person can, no matter what race or religion he belongs to, I think the situation would be much healthier.\"\nThe singer and actor was being interviewed on BBC Wales to promote her week-long residency at the Double Diamond Club in Caerphilly, a scenic town near Cardiff. While the popular venue did in its time host big stars such as Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash, it was still a long way from Broadway.\nIn the US at that time, Kitt was cancelled. Her career had faltered following a White House luncheon in 1968 to discuss the causes of juvenile delinquency with Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of President Lyndon B Johnson. As protests against the Vietnam War raged across the US, Kitt's diagnosis of the problem's causes upset the genteel audience. She told the First Lady: \"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don't want to go to school because they're going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.\"\nIn response, the CIA compiled a dossier on her. The New York Times revealed in 1975 that this extensive report contained \"second\u2010hand gossip about the entertainer but no evidence of any foreign intelligence connections\". Asked in later years about the notorious \"nymphomaniac\" claim reported to be contained in the document, Kitt was supremely dismissive: \"What has that got to do with the CIA if I was?\"\nWhile her career back home was in the doldrums, she spent time in Britain touring provincial clubs. During one such residency at the distinctly unglamorous Batley Variety Club in West Yorkshire, a BBC reporter asked her how such a sophisticated celebrity could feel an affinity with local people there. She replied: \"I wasn't born in such a different world. I came out of extreme poverty. I have acquired things, yes. The things have not acquired me.\"\nIt wasn't until 1978, ten years after that White House incident, that Kitt made her triumphant Broadway return in the musical Timbuktu!. She remained a frequent visitor to Britain, often making outrageous appearances on television talk shows. Again, her vulnerability was never too far from the surface. In one spectacular 1989 BBC appearance, she began by resting her feet flirtatiously on the lap of host Terry Wogan. Just a few minutes later, she was confessing that her public persona was nothing like her private self.\nShe said: \"Mr Wogan, you know something? I'm not an extrovert. I can tease as 'Eartha Kitt', but as Eartha Mae? Forget it. I'm hiding behind the bushes, behind the chairs, behind everything I could possibly find to hide behind, because I've never had that kind of security within Eartha Mae that makes me feel that she will ever be accepted.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How a child star saved a Hollywood studio\n\u2022 Nina Simone on how fury fuelled her songs\n\u2022 Toni Morrison on her mission to please black fans\nKitt's abiding loves were her fans and her daughter. Having been abandoned by her own mother, Kitt insisted on bringing her daughter with her all over the world. Her marriage to businessman Bill McDonald in 1960 lasted less than four years, and she never remarried. Asked by Wogan if she had been reluctant to let her guard down, she said: \"A man has always wanted to lay me down, but he never wanted to pick me up.\"\nShe said that it was the love she received from adoring crowds that \"makes me feel that I really am a worthwhile person\". However, she also explained: \"When I go back to the dressing room, I take off the makeup and I'm not 'Eartha Kitt' anymore, I'm Eartha Mae again.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "Jeremy Sewall has cooked at eateries around the world, but home in Boston, he's known for his clam chowder. Here are his top local bowls, from Neptune Oyster to Yankee Lobster.\nNew England Clam chowder \u2013 a stick-to-your-ribs cream-based clam and potato stew \u2013 is beloved all over the United States, but synonymous with the city of Boston.\nClear broth-style chowders or stews made by the New England region's Indigenous peoples date back hundreds of years, including tribes in what is now Massachusetts. Quahogs, a type of local clam, along with other shellfish, fish and native ingredients like corn and beans were primary ingredients in early-recorded renditions of the chowder, which later incorporated traditions brought by English settlers, who swapped corn and beans for potatoes. And since 1836, chowder \u2013 or chowdah, as it's often pronounced in Boston \u2013 has been proudly served at the city's Union Oyster House, the oldest restaurant in continuous service in the US. Over the decades, New England-style clam chowder has become woven into the very fabric of the city's culinary identity.\nThough Boston's food scene has become world-class and international, clam chowder is still found on menus all over town, from the city's finest eateries to the concession stands at Fenway Park, the iconic Red Sox ballpark. But not all creamy clam chowders are made equal. To highlight Boston's most extraordinary bowls, we spoke to Jeremy Sewall, chef and partner of Row 34 in Boston's atmospheric Seaport.\nThe SpeciaList\nNationally recognised chef Jeremy Sewall helmed kitchens around the world before opening New England seafood restaurant Row 34 in Boston. Today, the restaurant has four locations throughout the region, with a second Boston location planned later in 2025. Sewall has co-written a trio of lauded seafood cookbooks and has appeared on numerous cooking television shows, including Top Chef and Beat Bobby Flay.\nWhile the hallmarks of traditional New England clam chowder are sacrosanct \u2013 a milky-white creamy base, chopped clams, diced potatoes and often bacon or salt pork \u2013 opinions vary on other elements and ingredients. Sewall himself thickens Row 34's chowder with a traditional roux of flour and butter, adding salty bacon fat to deliver a velvety taste. His secret ingredient is a subtle dash of green tabasco. \"It adds a nice little bit of spice and acidity to it,\" he says. \"[Chowder's] been a part of Boston culture for a long time and represents what New England is. It's a hearty, simple dish that, when done really well, is an iconic thing. That's why it's been around for hundreds of years and is still one of the most popular dishes in Boston.\"\nSewall adds that Boston's location on Massachusetts Bay, and by extension, the Atlantic Ocean, intrinsically lends itself to phenomenal just-caught seafood. \"It's accessible here,\" he says. \"It's just part of how we make things; certainly a simple thing like chowder. The chopped clams that everybody traditionally uses for chowder, they're all available, so it's just how we cook here.\"\nHere are Sewall's favourite clam chowders in Boston.\nSummer Shack is a laidback restaurant in Boston's affluent Back Bay neighbourhood, just three blocks from the world-famous Boston Marathon finish line. This renowned spot is a casual outpost founded by the late Jasper White, an iconic chef best known as a pioneer in Boston fine dining. Summer Shack's menu promises a \"classic New England clam chowder\", and delivers a medium-thick, clam-packed creation. \"I think they're really good about not letting it get too thick. Some places do a really thick chowder, which I don't love,\" says Sewall. \"Summer Shack's is classic. It's oyster crackers and bacon and chopped clams and potatoes; that's exactly what I wanted today.\"\nMost Boston restaurants serve their chowder alongside packs of Westminster Backer's Co oyster crackers \u2013 flaky, dime-size crackers that diners can add in at their discretion. But Summer Shack takes the liberty of serving their chowder with oyster crackers already on top. \"Any chowder has to have some good pieces of stuff in there because it adds that texture,\" says Sewall. \"It can't be all pur\u00e9ed. You've got to feel like you're seeing stuff on your spoon and chewing things. Anything that's too creamy or too pur\u00e9ed? No. Doesn't work.\"\nWebsite: www.summershackrestaurant.com/location/summer-shack-boston\nAddress: 50 Dalton Street, Boston, MA 02115\nPhone: +1 617-867-9955\nInstagram: @jwsummershack\n\"Little Whale's is another great version of a classic clam chowder; very straight forward,\" says Sewall, crediting the restaurant's chef Michael Serpa. \"He does fresh clam, potato, bacon, celery and a little bit of fresh herbs in there. That's what chowder is supposed to be.\"\nInsider Tip\nBoston is the quintessential four-season city \u2013 cold winters, hot summers, a mild spring and a crisp autumn that Sewall believes stands out as the best time to visit. The cool air relieves the summer heat, he says, and Boston's many tree-lined streets transform into a cacophony of colour thanks to unbelievable autumn foliage. \"A New England fall is hard to beat,\" says Sewall. \"Things quiet down a bit compared to that frantic summer feel.\"\nThough chef Serpa is otherwise known for creative takes on seafood classics, cherrystone clams are the cornerstone of Little Whale's chowder. These meaty but lean palm-sized hard-shelled clams are well-suited for chowder as they are sweet and mild, their briny tenderness emphasised by the creamy broth. Though native to the US's East Coast, many chefs in the US gravitate to cherrystones harvested from New England's cool waters. Serpa's menu specifies that their rendition of chowder includes smoked bacon and thyme, flavours that impart a subtle smoky punch and dash of earthiness.\nNestled in a 19th-Century brownstone, Little Whale is a petite, charming eatery on tony Newbury Street in Back Bay. A banquette lines the wall, but the marble-top bar is one of the best spots to belly up for a chowder bowl, unless it's warm out, when the patio reigns supreme.\nWebsite: www.littlewhaleboston.com\nAddress: 314 Newbury Street, Boston, MA 02115\nPhone: +1 857-277-0800\nInstagram: @littlewhaleoysterbar\nWith cosy marble tables for two and a robust wine list full of celebratory bubbly, this tiny 37-seat temple to briny aphrodisiacs oozes romance.\nNeptune Oyster, modelled after classic Parisian oyster bars, has been a staple in Boston's predominately Italian North End neighbourhood \u2013 an iconic culinary hub \u2013 for more than two decades. A queue promising an hour-long wait is common outside this shoebox-sized restaurant, which swells with accolades from sources like The New York Times and the James Beard Foundation.\n\"Neptune does an awesome job,\" says Sewall. \"It's a classic oyster bar and they've done chowder in Boston for many, many years. It's consistent, and that can be hard to do.\"\nNeptune's Wellfleet clam chowder, named after the coastal community on nearby Cape Cod where the clams are sourced, is the most brothy on Sewall's list compared to thicker renditions, but it offers hearty chunks of fresh clams and tender potatoes that stop just short of mushy and a savouriness derived from salt-cured pork belly. Topped with thyme and a sprinkle of paprika, Neptune Oyster's chowder is perfectly suitable on its own or as an idyllic prelude to the restaurant's iconic lobster roll.\nWebsite: www.neptuneoyster.com\nAddress: 63 Salem Street #1, Boston, MA 02113\nPhone: +1 617-742-3474\nInstagram: @neptuneoyster\n\"James Hook does a really good chowder,\" says Sewall. A family-owned lobster restaurant and Boston mainstay since 1925, James Hook earned its enviable reputation in the lobster business, catching the crustaceans in Maine and Canada then hauling the lot down to Boston for distribution. Today, the restaurant ships more than 50,000lb of lobster daily across the US, while their simple counter-service seafood shanty is just steps from Boston Harbor.\nJames Hook's menu boasts New England clam \"chowda\" with a consistency that is thick, but not enough to distract from the flavour of the sweet whole clams, punctuated by hearty thick-cut potatoes. It's twice been crowned champion of Boston's annual Chowderfest, a summertime competition of the best chowders in the region.\nWebsite: https://www.jameshooklobster.com\nAddress: 440 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02110\nPhone: +1 617-423-5501\nInstagram: @jameshooklobster\nA Boston favourite since 1950, Yankee Lobster is run by the third generation of the Zanti family, who have made their living on the water. The restaurant is decidedly casual \u2013 diners order at a counter and are given a buoy with a number letting servers know where to deliver their grub. Yankee Lobster doubles as a seafood market, and its location in Boston's swanky Seaport lures locals and visitors alike.\nThe legendary \"spoon test\" for New England clam chowder is performed by inserting a spoon in the centre of the chowder to see if the consistency is thick enough to make the spoon stand straight up. Though Sewall says he personally prefers chowder not quite thick enough to pass the spoon test, he is a fan of Yankee Lobster's chowder. \"It's traditional, it's creamy, it's hot and it's rich \u2013 all the stuff it should be,\" he says. \"They do a great job.\"\nWebsite: https://www.yankeelobster.com\nAddress: 300 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA 02210\nPhone: +1 617-423-5501\nInstagram: @yankeelobsterco\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Abstract art, for instance, evokes moods in a non-literal, suggestive way \u2013 a large painting or print dominated by loose, expressionistic mark-making can give a home a romantic, free-spirited feel, while a more hard-edged, graphic style gives a space a modern, urban feel.\nAcquiring and displaying art isn't the preserve of homeowners, either; in fact, it's a great way to make a rental home feel more personal, without having to redecorate \u2013 and your pictures can move on when you do. It's this flexibility that makes art such a useful element of home d\u00e9cor \u2013 artworks can be arranged, then reconfigured to change the character of a room. \"A piece doesn't have to be in one location forever,\" says Katherine Kittoe, founder of Kittoe Contemporary, an online and physical art gallery and art consultancy that promotes emerging and established artists. \"A re-hang of artworks every few years \u2013 similar in principle to re-hangs in large public galleries, though obviously on a more modest scale \u2013 can be hugely rewarding and refreshing.\"\nThis, though, raises the practical but important question of how to repair walls dented by holes left after hanging. \"Small nails are your best friend \u2013 they're easy to patch up with spackling paste when it\u2019s time to move out,\" says Cathy Glazer, founder of Artfully Walls, a curated site for art-buyers in the UK and US. \"Lightweight pieces can be hung with thin nails and hooks from a basic picture-hanging kit. Most standard picture-hangers hold up to 30lbs. It's easier still to lean art on ledges or on stacks of books, mantelpieces or consoles for a very casual look.\"\nOf course, when art is added to a home, it must coexist with furniture and homeware accumulated over time. Yet it needn't vie for attention with existing elements or get visually lost among them \u2013 it can be artfully displayed adjacent to homeware with similar qualities, for example echoing the bold, colourful pattern in a rug or the sensual curves of ceramics. And it can be shown with ephemera \u2013 from postcards to family snaps \u2013 to create aesthetically pleasing juxtapositions. \u00a0\nWall-hung art can counterbalance the bulky, imposing look of furniture that occupies a permanent spot, such as sofas, according to Sophie Goldhill, co-founder of Liddicoat & Goldhill and its interior design arm, Hector Interiors: \"A striking painting can serve as a visual focal point paired with sofas and tables, and can offset the weight of larger pieces that could otherwise dominate a space,\" she tells the BBC.\nAnd introducing a new artwork into a room can make the space more cohesive, Goldhill adds. \"Art offers an opportunity to link different design elements, such as contrasting materials or colours, in a space, ensuring it doesn't feel disjointed. A thoughtfully chosen piece of art can reflect or complement tones in fabrics or wood, tying the room's design together.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The nine paint colours that can transform a home\n\u2022 Inside eight of the best fashion designers' homes\n\u2022 Why influencers are facing a pushback\nOpting for usable art can make buying and displaying artworks fun and accessible. A set of coasters and placemats \u2013 created with images by UK photographer Martin Parr and sold by art platform Plinth \u2013 is a good example. The aptly food-themed creations feature kitsch, close-up photos of cocktails filled with maraschino cherries, ice cream or tea in traditional cups and saucers.\nFood is also a major theme in the work of UK artist Selina Snow, whose joyful pieces depict mouth-watering delicacies from around the world \u2013 from colourful sushi to the humble full English breakfast. Snow has built up an eclectic collection of art and personal memorabilia that includes paintings and prints by her late father, Peter Snow, an artist and theatre designer, and myriad posters, textiles, objects and artefacts acquired on her travels. These are displayed in her home in the New Forest, Hampshire, alongside her own artworks, against a mainly neutral backdrop of grey and white walls.\nThe buttercup yellow fireplace in Snow's living room has informed the choice of objects displayed on the mantelpiece and the art on the wall above it. A Balinese theatre mask representing a devil's head and a bust by artist Corin Johnson reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich, both of a similar height, stand at either end of the mantelpiece. Above it hangs an abstract painting featuring a pattern of yellow spots that echo the colour of the fireplace. \"I like the way the bust and mask balance each other and frame the painting,\" Snow tells the BBC.\nBut Snow doesn't see her combinations of objects as simply toning chromatically. \"I don't want pieces to blend together so they lose their individual character, but so they enhance each other. I like to link colours but not obviously. I've got a sculpture of a violinist standing on a sulphur yellow table that picks up on a black pattern detail in a painting above it.\"\nShe also pairs very different pieces that nevertheless share the same motifs. In Snow's bedroom is a wooden headboard carved with flower shapes by her late husband, sculptor Richard Austin; above it is a painting of flowers.\nSnow puts postcard-sized reproductions of paintings in inexpensive frames to elevate them and make them stand out. But for original artworks, she recommends investing in a professional framing service in order to preserve them well.\nRoberto Ekholm, a London-based artist, curator and art advisor, who has mounted art shows in his own home, raises a similar point: \"Be careful how you look after the medium. Don't let direct sunlight fall on framed paintings. You might have to install a UV protective window film over glass in brighter spots.\"\nEkholm also points out that while sculpture might be associated by many with monumental works in galleries, it has a place in the home, too. \"It can be limiting using only tables, plinths or floor space to display sculptures,\" he says. \"At home, I like to arrange mine on affordable free-floating shelves at different heights and in various sizes, which creates an interesting domestic display.\"\nWhile Snow and Ekholm have art collections that grew organically, aided by long-standing art-world connections, many people establish theirs from scratch. So what criteria should apply when you're acquiring your first original artworks? \"Visit art exhibitions and auctions to explore what kind of art resonates with you,\" advises Kittoe. She cites the London Art Fair (on later this month), Affordable Art Fair and British Art Fair as good places in the UK to source art, as well as art trails and open-studio events.\nKittoe also suggests making use of a \"try before you buy\" service: \"Many galleries allow you to see works in your own space before committing to the purchase. This can be useful as homes are so different to a brightly lit gallery, and this arrangement allows you to see the works at different times of the day and try them in different parts of the house. When hanging several pictures together, play with potential configurations by laying them out on the floor before committing them to fixed spots on the wall.\"\nIn the end, go with what feels right for you. As Cathy Glazer puts it: \"Whether it's travel posters, collages or fleamarket finds, your collection should reflect what resonates with you. But if you're unsure where to begin, it can help to adhere to a theme, for example a grouping of botanicals, portraits or black-and-white photography. Choosing art can feel intimidating but it's not about right or wrong, it's about what speaks to you.\"\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In January 1997, Tony Bullimore was trapped inside an upturned yacht that was filling up with \"bitterly cold\" water in one of the remotest parts of the Southern Ocean. In History looks back at an incredible feat of survival, and an amazing rescue.\nBritish sailor Tony Bullimore had just made himself a cup of tea and was settling down to eat some crackers and corned beef in the galley of his racing boat, the Exide Challenger, when he heard the sound of a crack. \"The snap was like a match,\" he said in a BBC documentary in 1997. That sound was the keel \u2013 the flat blade on the yacht's bottom that kept it right-side up \u2013 snapping off. It was then that all hell broke loose. \"The yacht turned over in literally a few seconds \u2013 three, four, five seconds, the yacht was upside down. I mean, it was as quick as that.\"\nAs the boat rolled over, Bullimore was catapulted out of his seat, somersaulting and landing feet first on the inside of the roof of the yacht's galley. \"The amazing thing was, I was standing all of a sudden on the roof, inside on the roof of the yacht. The roof was now the bottom of the hull. And I've got these very big viewing windows and I'm looking down into the sea.\"\nIt was then that Bullimore realised just how much trouble he was in. \"When I looked down into the windows, I noticed that the boom from the foremast was slamming up against one of the windows because it was now loose, but it was hanging in there because the ropes were holding it in place.\" The solid carbon-fibre pole was being rammed repeatedly against the window like a sledgehammer by the motion of the storm waves. \"Within about half an hour, it smashed the window. And the water came in the boat like the Niagara Falls upside down,\" he said. As freezing water poured into the hull, it fused the electrics \u2013 plunging Bullimore and the whole vessel into darkness. \"Once the window went, that really put me into a different league of problems,\" he told the BBC with characteristic understatement.\nThe 57-year-old sailor from Bristol, England had been competing in the Vend\u00e9e Globe, a gruelling non-stop singlehanded around-the-world yacht race. It is considered by many to be the world's toughest sailing race, but Bullimore was a seasoned yachtsman. As the race took the competitors eastwards into the Southern Ocean towards Australia, a violent storm struck, and the Exide Challenger was battered by ferocious waves and winds of up to 100mph (160km/h).\n\"You look in front of you and think it's an iceberg, you see this enormous mountain [of water], it could be up to 60, 70, 80ft (25m) high, and you can't believe it,\" Bullimore said. \"Apart from the wave breaking forward, you get a split wave where it's breaking backwards as well, like a tumultuous mountain of water. It's really quite incredible. The power behind some of those waves, I mean, you are talking about several double-decker buses chucked in together.\"\nHe had battled this wild and unforgiving storm for several hours and, believing that he had his yacht under control and all the hatches battened down, he was \"feeling pretty pleased\" with himself. When the boat then suddenly flipped over, initially he couldn't believe what had happened. \"I probably said to myself, 'I don't believe that the keel's snapped off,' a couple of dozen times, but it had,\" he told the BBC. \"I was shocked, but I'm a pretty steady guy. I don't panic.\"\nWith the viewing window now broken and the upturned hull rapidly filling up, Bullimore fought his way through the \"bitterly cold\" rising seawater to get his insulated waterproof survival suit, stripped off his sodden clothes and put it on. Despite the sea rushing in, The Exide Challenger didn't immediately sink. This was because its bulkheads, which divided the ship into smaller watertight compartments, were helping keep it afloat. The water stopped rising just below Bullimore's neckline but it now formed waves inside the boat that were pitching from side-to-side, as the squall pounded the Exide Challenger from the outside. \"You could see the seas that were inside the hull smashing up against one side, then rolling and churning up and then rolling to the other side of the yacht. It was like the inside of a washing machine,\" he said.\nThe smashed window and the boat's motion were creating a powerful vacuum effect, pulling everything \u2013 food, charts, equipment \u2013 out through the hole. \"It was unbelievable, it just kept ripping things out. Food in plastic boxes that was lashed down, once the lashings got loose, the boxes just flew out.\" Bullimore found one of his emergency beacons, tied it to a piece of rope, dived down and pushed it through the broken window, hoping it would float to the ocean surface and someone would pick up its distress transmission.\nAlthough the Exide Challenger was afloat for now, he knew that if the capsized yacht's watertight bulkheads started to fail, he would need the life raft which was secured in the cockpit. He ducked under the water and opened the hatch to the cockpit to try to cut the life raft free. \"All of a sudden the door started to close with the pressure and I'm trying to get my hand back in. I wanted to shut the door with me inside and my little finger got caught in the door, right on the latch. I saw it sort of squeeze, and I saw the end of my finger drop off.\" The freezing seawater helped stem the bleeding from his severed finger and numb the pain. \"It didn't actually hurt, my hands were that cold,\" he said.\nIN HISTORY\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nDespite the trauma, Bullimore remained remarkably composed, but he knew he wouldn't survive long in the icy water. \"The most important thing was that I had to find somewhere inside the yacht where I could get up and get out of the water because it was absolutely apparent that if I stayed in the water I was gone. I was going to die.\"\nHe went deeper into the pitch-black yacht and found a dry narrow shelf that was above the water. There he rigged up some netting next to it and crawled onto it. \"It was a little kind of hammock that was up very high. It was just floating above the water, and I could get up in there and I could be out. It was amazing because after two or three hours my body started to feel warmer.\"\nMeanwhile, 1,400 miles (2,250km) off the Australian coast, the Exide Challenger's distress signal was picked up. Australia's maritime authorities also received an emergency beacon from another sailor, Frenchman Thierry Dubois, whose yacht had capsized in the storm, too. They launched an intensive search-and-rescue operation, sending reconnaissance aircraft to scour the area. Because the two distress signals were transmitting from such a remote area, the planes had just three hours at a time to search that part of the Southern Ocean's expanse before the planes needed to return to refuel. The Royal Australian Navy deployed the HMAS Adelaide to join the search.\nFor the next four days, Bullimore lay curled up in his makeshift hammock entombed in Exide Challenger's upturned hull, as the seawater in the vessel gradually rose and his air supply slowly dwindled. \"The more water that got into the yacht, the less space there was for oxygen. Eventually you get to a situation where 80%, 85%, 90% of the area where I was, was full of water, and 10%, 15% would be for air, oxygen. And when you get to that stage, I've got to hold my head up to a little area that is high up. The whole thing becomes very difficult then,\" he said.\nMost of his food and water had been swept out the broken window, but Bullimore had found a can, which he managed to open with his knife, a bar of chocolate and a couple of small sachets of water, which he rationed to get them to last as long as possible. He lashed ropes to himself to stop himself drowning, in case he fell asleep and his head dropped into the water. After three days he ran out of water, adding the grim possibility of dying through dehydration to his list of problems.\nDespite the cold, the isolation and his desperate situation, Bullimore did not let himself succumb to despair. He resolved to stay alive through sheer willpower. \"I mean, I felt I had problems, but quite frankly if you are determined enough and you've sort of made up your mind that you are not going to give in easy and that you are going to go the whole hog, it's quite simple that you carry on.\"\nAs conditions worsened, Bullimore continued to focus on doing everything he could to give himself the best chance of rescue. He would turn his beacon on and off to signal to anyone listening that he was alive. He repeatedly plunged into the Exide Challenger's freezing water to secure his life raft so it didn't get sucked through the broken window and float away. He feared that if that happened, the search-and-rescue team might see a floating life raft and mistakenly think that he had abandoned the vessel and drowned in the stormy waters outside. \"There were still a couple of opportunities and however thin and however small the opportunities were, it was a case of fighting and hanging on,\" he said.\nIn the Exide Challenger's small air pocket, 900 miles (1,450km) off Antarctica, he ran through different survival strategies in his mind. \"I mean, one of my opportunities was to take to the life raft and hopefully drift to Antarctica with a finishing line that I had made up,\" he said. \"It was a bit absurd. You've got the cold, you've got the storms, you've got the vastness of the Southern Ocean.\"\nBut as the hours and days passed, tossed around by giant waves and aware of the increasing hopelessness of his situation, he prepared himself for death. \"I was beginning to feel that I might have reached the end of the line,\" he told the BBC.\nHe calmly divided up the remaining time he felt he had left, setting aside space to reflect on his life. \"It was really simply just a case of me looking at the logistics of the situation and sort of finalising my mind, and indexing what I was going to think for the next few hours. I want to allocate so much time for my wife and family. I want to allocate so much time to other aspects of my life. And I actually blocked off and prepared myself for the final moment.\"\nOn 8 January, after days of searching, the rescue team spotted the Exide Challenger's upturned hull. The team had already found and rescued his competitor Dubois, who had also survived despite the appalling conditions. But on Bullimore's boat they couldn't see any visible signs of life.\nLying in pitch blackness inside the upturned yacht, Bullimore heard the plane flying overhead. He was aware that a plane wouldn't be able to pick him up, and that he couldn't risk leaving the boat if he wasn't sure that he had a chance of being rescued. He knew that if he swam out of the Exide Challenger, he wouldn't be able to get back in again and would drown or freeze to death in the Southern Ocean's treacherous waters.\nIn the early hours of 9 January, the Royal Australian Navy's HMAS Adelaide reached the upturned Exide Challenger and sent a crew out in a dinghy to determine if the sailor was still alive. When he first heard the rescuers knocking on the hull and then the sound of their voices, Bullimore told the BBC, he was ecstatic. He started banging and shouting back. \"It was my opportunity, I'd been waiting for it, it was the door, the gate, the window, it opened a little bit and it was up to me to get through it. No hanging about,\" he said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The British politician who faked his own death\n\u2022 Titanic survivor on the moment the ship sank\n\u2022 A death-defying D-Day mission in a wooden glider\nFilled with a surge of adrenaline, he dived into the boat's freezing waters, and swam through the darkness out of the bottom of the yacht. \"It took me just seconds to get to the other end of the yacht and seconds to dive out of the yacht and up, and there was the Adelaide.\"\nThe rescue crew spotted him on the other side of the Exide Challenger as he emerged on the ocean's surface. They raced over and hauled him out of the ocean, weak but alive. As they laid him out on the dinghy's floor, they covered him with insulation blankets. \"Someone I think had a spare jacket and chucked one under my head as a little pillow and said, 'You're alright, mate.'\" He was almost overcome with gratitude to his rescuers. He recalled to the BBC that one of the Australian Navy crew was \"looking after me like a baby, talking, you know, and everything was great, and I gave him a kiss on his beard\".\u00a0\nBullimore was brought aboard HMAS Adelaide to cheers from its crew, but he did not survive his ordeal unscathed. As well as losing part of a finger, he was suffering from hypothermia and dehydration, had frostbite on his forehead and fingertips, had fractured a tooth and was covered in cuts. He would undergo weeks of decompression treatment in a specialised medical centre afterwards.\nHe was reunited with his wife Lalel at the British High Commission office in Perth, Australia. The pair were already well-known figures in their hometown of Bristol. In the 1960s, they had opened The Bamboo Club together, a reggae venue where people of all backgrounds could socialise safely, and which had hosted such stars as Bob Marley and the Wailers, Desmond Dekker, Ben E King and Tina Turner. But now Bullimore's miraculous survival at sea had made him a worldwide news story, with many hailing his heroism and fortitude.\nIt was a label the sailor himself rejected, telling the BBC that the heroes were the ones \"that got themselves down to the Southern Ocean to get hold of me and bring me back\". He added: \"I'd be happier to call myself lucky than a hero.\"\n\u00a0--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "From Colombia's upcycled sewer pipes to spheres suspended in the sky in Canada, capsule hotels have been reinvented for a new generation of travellers.\nBy night, the world's first capsule hotel (founded in Osaka, Japan in 1979) must have looked like a morgue, with neat rows of narrow sleeping capsules each containing a recumbent body. But the following day, the occupants \u2013 mostly businessmen who had worked late - would rise up and head back to the office, grateful for this efficient sleep solution that had saved them a commute home in the early hours.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the concept spread, tourists happy to sleep in a room no bigger than its bed began to bunk up alongside them, eager to sample this unusual aspect of Japanese culture. Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled by years of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the current boom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security.\nWith the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers. They're tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, from upcycled sewer pipes in the Colombian desert to space-age pods with a dashboard of ambient controls in downtown Sydney, Australia \u2013 all promising a unique experience and shareable stories for social media. Meanwhile capsule-cum-bookstores invite book lovers to snooze among the shelves, and boutique versions bring luxury to a traditionally no-frills market with fancy decor or promises of fluffy duck-feather duvets.\nAs the concept continues to reinvent itself, here are eight of the most extraordinary examples.\nNine Hours, a chain of 13 hotels across Japan, from Fukuoka in the west to the north-east island of Hokkaido, has an unusual by-product: sleep data. In the Shinagawa Station (men only) and Akasaka branches, guests can sign up for a \"9h sleep fitscan\" service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report that tracks their heart rate, identifies sleep apnea and even monitors snoring. In a sector where a novel or low-budget stay is often prioritised over comfort, Nine Hours' interest in how well its guests are sleeping sets it apart.\nAcross the franchise, the white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods would not look out of place on the set of a science-fiction movie. The name refers to the hotel's cost-cutting concept that reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Just need a nap? Hourly rates are also available.\nA night in a transparent sleeping pod clinging to a cliff face above Peru's Sacred Valley is not everyone's idea of a relaxing stay, but for adrenaline-lovers, it's hard to beat \u2013 not least for the incredible 300-degree views of the surrounding mountains and the formidable condors that inhabit them.\nA near-vertical climb of 400m is the only way to reach the Skylodge Adventure Suites, but climbing experience is not necessary \u2013 only good health and a head for heights \u2013 and descending is speedier thanks to a series of zip wires. Each capsule includes a private bathroom ensuring that night trips to the toilet are not life-threatening, and when the sun rises, you can enjoy a cup of tea on your private deck. Looking for a little more luxury? A little further down the Urubamba river, sister site, Starlodge, adds hillside hot tubs to the capsule hotel experience.\nThe Tubo Hotel, La Tatacoa is just a 10-minute drive from Colombia's second-largest desert, the eponymous Tatacoa, famous for its clear starry skies. When you've taken in the giant cacti and curious rock formations of the Tatacoa's cinnamon-coloured sands, this rainbow of tiny, air-conditioned rooms with a shared swimming pool offers a welcome oasis. The 37 capsules are fashioned from concrete sewer pipes painted in candy colours, providing just enough room for a double bed. Almost half of the rooms have a shared bathroom, but the room rate is a snip and you've a shady garden, bar and restaurant on your doorstep. \"This innovative and colourful place offers you a unique experience,\" says Ambar Quintana, the hotel's administrator. \"It has everything you need to rest in a natural environment of fresh air and vegetation.\"\nSuspended among the conifers like oversized Christmas baubles, the Free Spirit Spheres on Vancouver Island, Canada, feel \"like you are floating in the canopy among the sleeping birds\", according to owner Tom Chudleigh. The first sphere was introduced 25 years ago, driven by a desire to promote ecotourism and preserve Canada's ancient forests.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\n\u2022 The best travel photographs from around the globe\n\u2022 The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\nThere are currently three spheres, each based on the principle of biomimicry and shaped with a giant seed pod or nutshell in mind: light but with a strong shell. \"Eryn\" is fashioned from Sitka spruce and has a dining area, sink and slightly undersized double bed inside; while more recent additions, \"Melody\" and \"Luna\", are fibreglass and have similar amenities but with full-size double beds that can be stowed. Each sphere is accessed via a spiral staircase wrapped around a tree, and is available to rent in temperatures as low as -20C, when even a trip to the composting toilet at the accommodation's base will feel intrepid.\nThe shape makes bespoke fittings a prerequisite, and every little detail has been meticulously crafted by Chudleigh, from walnut fold-out furniture that maximises the space, to door handles cast from bronze.\nInside a Brutalist building in Singapore's Chinatown lies a surprisingly serene interior. Opened in 2021 and based on an aesthetic it describes as \"soft minimalist\", KINN Capsule offers a Zen take on the capsule concept with walls painted in calming peachy tones and pale wood sleeping chambers fitted with crisp white bed linen. Even the smell of the place seems an antidote to its urban location as a special house fragrance designed to evoke the wildflowers of a Nordic forest hangs in the air. There are 72 capsules in total, sealed off with blackout blinds and spread across seven rooms, but the vibe is more boutique than bunkhouse.\nA traditional mud and wood farmhouse in eastern China's Zhejiang Province got a prize-winning makeover in 2019 when it reopened as a capsule hostel, bookstore and community library, sleeping 20 in tiny single bed-sized compartments concealed between bookshelves made of local bamboo. A smattering of small landings are connected by zigzagging stairways that recall the serpentine paths of the surrounding forests of Tonglu. It's hard to know which is more dramatic: the remote building's transparent floor-to-ceiling panels that light it up like a cathedral at night, or the lush mountainous scenery that's visible through them.\nIn Oud Zuid, one of Amsterdam's most upscale neighbourhoods, guests are paying to sleep in cupboards. The quirky De Bedstee Hotel draws on the 17th-Century tradition of the Dutch bedstee (box bed), a bed concealed behind cupboard doors to create a cosy sleeping nook. The hotel's Art Deco features and acid-coloured wallpapers downstairs give way to a shabby-chic design in the first-floor dormitories, where the bedstee windows are framed by red gingham curtains and little wooden ladders lead to the capsules above. Relax in the hotel's small terrace garden or take a half-hour stroll to the Rembrandt House Museum in the city centre to see several historic box beds in situ.\nAnother hotel with a signature smell is the Resol Poshtel in Tokyo's Asakusa district \u2013 the Resol Hotel chain's first venture into capsule sleeping. The aroma, which includes orange, chamomile and neroli, is said to induce \"a feeling of gentle calm\" \u2013 of benefit, perhaps, given the communal sleeping arrangements. At bedtime, there's nothing but a curtain between you and fellow visitors, but few one-star establishments can match this hotel's cleanliness and functionality, with hairbrushes, slippers and razors included in the freebies. The Edo-era styling \u2212 such as the sleeping cubicles' arched entrance reminiscent of tea ceremony rooms, and the traditional Japanese murals surrounding the bed \u2212 add a hint of heritage to the hotel's modern lines. The city's oldest Buddhist temple, Sens\u014d-ji, is a five-minute walk away, as is the lantern-lined Nakamise-dori street, home to a parade of colourful shops selling souvenirs and street food.\n--\nThis story was first published in August and was one of our most-read Travel stories of the year.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Children played on fairground rides designed by the world's greatest artists for a single summer before they disappeared for decades.\nThe attractions were part of the world's first art funfair - Luna Luna - dreamed up by little-known Austrian creative Andr\u00e9 Heller in the 1970s, featuring a carousel by Keith Haring, a Ferris wheel by Jean-Michel Basquiat and a David Hockney pavilion.\nVisitors could wander Roy Lichtenstein's hall of mirrors and marvel at Salvador Dali's fun dome, sampling biscuits decorated by artist Gertie Fr\u00f6lich as actors dressed as nuns and flamingos milled about.\nA successful attraction for months, plans for a grand European tour formed - but when they later fell through, an extensive legal battle ensued and the rides were shut down, disassembled and packed away, forgotten.\nUntil now.\nAmerican entrepreneur Michael Goldberg stumbled across Luna Luna on an art blog. He'd never heard of it, despite some of the art world's biggest names contributing. Neither, to his surprise, had his friends in the industry.\n\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"\n'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.\nThe two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly. \nOpening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation. \nThe foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.\nDecades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen. \nHis key investor? Global rap star Drake, via his investment and entertainment business DreamCrew.\n\"The idea of restoring something so rich in cultural history outweighed the risks and for us, it wasn't about guarantees,\" Anthony Gonzales, CEO of DreamCrew, told the BBC.\nThe New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.\nWhen he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.\n\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.\nIt was a sleepless night.\nBut the next day, as more paper was removed from a second container, the light caught a toffee-apple-red handlebar to Haring's carousel, then the white floorboards of  Basquiat's Ferris wheel, which \"could have been painted days ago\". It was a moment of \"instant relief\", said Goldberg.\nUnearthing the artwork wasn't the hardest part of Luna Luna's revival.\nBrad Gooch, author of recent official Haring biography, Radiant: The Life and Line of Keith Haring, saw Luna Luna being reconstructed, describing the feat as \"mind boggling.\"\n\"It was like a giant Lego with no instruction kit,\" he said.\nA crew of artists, carnival technicians, curators and architects worked together to meticulously rebuild Luna Luna for two years before its grand reopening in LA this March.\nNow, Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy has come to a Midtown Manhattan art and theatre complex, The Shed. The fair is on display alongside exhibits detailing its surreal curation process. \nAlex Poots, creative co-founder of The Shed, described the journey as a \"Raiders of the Lost Ark story\", in reference to the film, praising Heller's ability to commission artists of such high calibre while finding a format appealing to \"art lovers and yet to be art lovers.\"\n\"That is a holy grail kind of pursuit,\" he added. \nMost of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s. \nHockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.\nGoldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space. \nDrake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.\nThere's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.\nBasquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.\nHaring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.\n\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"\nPoots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"\nBut he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\". \nIt has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".\nHe added that ticket prices, criticised by some as being too high, are \"pretty reasonable\" as the show cost \"millions and millions of dollars to install\".\nAmong the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.\nHaring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".\nThe show is running from 20 November to 23 February, and will tour after it leaves The Shed.",

        "article_text": "\"Wembley is a lovely stadium. It's a lovely stadium to have a meltdown at.\"\nLewis Brownhill - the older brother of Burnley midfielder Josh - is one of about 5,000 candidates worldwide preparing to sit Fifa's exam to become a licensed football agent.\nBrownhill, 37, is a chief technician in the RAF, with three tours of Afghanistan during almost 20 years of service. \nHe also works as a scout for the Cassius Sports agency, which represents his brother along with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill.\n\"I feel more nervous, genuinely, than going to Afghanistan,\" Brownhill says.\n\"I had set my goal to be an agent. I always put a bit of pressure on myself to pass exams but because it was the next stage of my career I had to make sure I was able to do it.\n\"It doesn't help that the exam has had such a low pass rate, that's where the pressure comes from.\"\nBut can anyone become an agent? Why? How does it work? \nI attempted to find out by sitting Fifa's agent exam...\nThe Great Hall at Wembley hosted the Fifa exam in November \nIt's 8.30am on a cold November day in north London and we are shuffling up an escalator towards the Great Hall at Wembley Stadium to take a seat at one of 300 desks lined up in classic school exam style. \nThere are two pieces of paper and a pen on each desk.\nWe will face 20 multiple-choice questions in one nerve-wracking hour on everything from sell-on clauses to when agents can approach minors. You need to answer at least 75% (15 questions) correctly to pass.\nThe \u00a3300 entry fee at least gets you a bottle of water, accompanied by a shiver of GCSE dread from decades past. \nBut it also gives you a shot at the career of a lifetime as a Fifa-licensed agent in the glamorous world of professional football.\nThere are approximately 7,000 licensed agents worldwide, and during next month's January transfer window I'll be speaking to many of them - good and bad - to work out which players are going where.\nSome are understandably driven by their own agendas - the best interests for their clients and their agency.\nFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had an outspoken distaste for some agents, describing them as having an \"imagination beyond belief\" during negotiations over transfers, new contracts or pay rises.\n\"You get agents who buy [players'] groceries, do their travel, polish their boots,\" he said in 2011. \"That is the kind of human being you are having to deal with. Some dominate their lives.\"\nPremier League clubs spent more than \u00a3400m on agent fees in the year to February 2024, which can conjure up the caricature of a larger-than-life 'super agent' such as the late Mino Raiola.\nA far more realistic description of an agent is the well-travelled former EFL player who has years of real-life experience, which they then pass on to their clients.\nThere are also parents or close relatives looking to represent family members themselves - which some within the industry are critical of.\n\"There have been a lot of players damaged by not having proper agents - chancers who were able to just fill a form in, pay the money and the next day they're an agent,\" one agent tells me, speaking anonymously.\n\"I went for a few players and they said they weren't going to sign for me, but wanted to sign with their uncle's friend, next-door neighbour or dad's mate.\"\nBetween 2015 and 2023, when the industry was deregulated by Fifa, anyone in England without a criminal record could pay \u00a3500 plus VAT to the Football Association, sign a form and become an agent, even with zero industry experience.\nMany view the previous lack of control as having flooded the market with unqualified people. Even Fifa recognises it was a mistake. \nThe exam was reintroduced last year - having been in place between 2001 and 2015 through member associations - when the sport's governing body made it mandatory for all agents to be licensed by 1 October 2023.\nAlmost half of the 3,800 people who sat the exam in April 2023 failed.\nThe new Fifa licence is designed to boost standards and \"raise the professional and ethical standards of the profession\".\nFrom October last year, unlicensed agents were not allowed to work on transfers, contract negotiations or speak to players - although there are about 900 'legacy' agents registered before 2015 who do not have to take the exam.\nAgent Dean Eldredge with the late Sven-Goran Eriksson, one of his former clients\n\"There is that perception, maybe from the outside and unfounded in many cases, that anyone can be an agent,\" says Dean Eldredge, who runs Oporto Sports. \nEldredge deals exclusively with managers and coaches, working with Sven-Goran Eriksson before his death in August, and passed the first exam in April 2023.\nOporto has 15 coaches and managers on its books including former Leicester and Bristol City boss Nigel Pearson, Barnsley's Darrell Clarke, Rotherham's Steve Evans and ex-Lincoln and Blackburn chief Michael Appleton.\n\"It's an easy narrative to say 'oh, there's a lot of money being lost to the game because it's going to agents',\" Eldredge says.\n\"Well, if the agents are good and the agency is well run then they're essential to support that individual.\n\"While the exam is a positive step for the industry, it was far less relevant for me.\n\"I might be one of very few who specialise in working with managers so that could be something they could look at.\" \nThe exam may not correct everything but it is the first step in having the minimum knowledge about the international transfer system, how it works, how a player can be registered with clubs or how to represent minors.\nThe exam is broadly welcomed, despite some criticism of the questions. It is estimated to have cut the amount of agents by over half.\nFifa accepts the questions bear little relation to an agent's daily responsibility - and they are not supposed to. Fifa regulates the international transfer system and not the day-to-day care of players, so the exam focuses on knowledge of the market, not the human being.\n\"If it limits the number of bad agents in the game then it's good. It shouldn't be a given you could just go in and work in football,\" says former Walsall and Doncaster defender Jimmy O'Connor, who has joined Wasserman.\nIt is one of the biggest agencies in the world, with clients including Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca, Manchester City and England defender John Stones, Liverpool's Curtis Jones and Newcastle's Harvey Barnes.\nO'Connor is sitting the exam on his 40th birthday, after a 15-year playing career which started as a trainee at Aston Villa and finished at Kidderminster.\nFormer Bristol City and Norwich striker Aaron Wilbraham - who passed his exam last year - is at Murdock Sports Group, headed by former Preston and Northern Ireland defender Colin Murdock.\n\"I had bad experiences,\" said Wilbraham, who played for 10 clubs and retired aged 40 in 2020.\n\"I remember my first agent saying 'it doesn't matter who your agent is, if you do it on the pitch you'll get your moves'. That's not the case.\n\"Everything else off the pitch needs to be taken care of so you can concentrate on the football.\n\"If you are doing well you need someone in the background bringing attention to it, spinning plates and getting interest.\n\"The player has someone to call when something's gone wrong and may not want to ring his dad, who may be a builder and doesn't know what to do next.\n\"They have someone who knows football.\"\nBurnley forward Jay Rodriguez's father Kiko was trying to pass his exam at the second attempt\nBack to the day of the exam, and at breakfast in the Wembley hotel, Kiko Rodriguez - father of Burnley striker Jay - is also a bag of nerves. He works for Stoke-based Beswicks Sports and had been revising hard the night before.\nHe confesses he finds the process more stressful than watching Jay earn an England cap at Wembley against Chile in 2013.\nWhile Brownhill - who has clearly put the work in - tests me with some last-minute questions, another candidate sits down: the former Blackpool, Burnley, Preston and Oldham winger David Eyres, who has been working for Stellar agency for 17 years.\nIn the exam room, I speak to Brad Abrahams, 50, who until this point has been a senior manager in the construction industry. \nOriginally from Sydney, he has lived in the UK on and off for the past 24 years and is now based in Stevenage having worked in Asia, India and the Middle East.\nWhy the change in direction?\nHis motivation is his son Oliver, 15, who is part of Benfica's academy in London.\n\"Three years ago, my lad said 'when I make it I don't want to give my money to anyone else, I want you to represent me, dad',\" said Abrahams, who is also a goalkeeping coach for non-league side Newport Pagnell.\n\"It was very typical of my son, he's got a mature head. We've kept him out of the academy system so far and he reminds me on a weekly basis I have to become an agent.\"\nFrom the exam hall, it is clearly a male-dominated industry.\nLess than 10% of today's candidates are women and only 7% of registered agents worldwide are female.\nAutumn Brown, 24, works for PR company Outreach Talent Group (OTG), which represents clients in fashion, comedy, entertainment and sport and has recently signed England rugby winger Jess Breach.\nOTG plans to branch out into women's football and Brown - who played hockey for England age-group teams - is going in with her eyes open.\n\"It's definitely intimidating walking into an exam room when less than 10% is female,\" she says.\n\"As we've been growing we've had a number of calls with different sports agencies. I've only spoken to men on these sports calls. They immediately assume I'm not familiar with certain athletes or the industry.\n\"I do understand my value and I'm not someone that is tentative in those situations - so I'm not going to be intimidated.\"\nThe Fifa agent exam lasts 60 minutes and has 20 multiple choice questions\nAs the exam looms you can sense anxiety levels rising in the room. \nA stern notice from the chief invigilator outlines the rules and warns of Fifa disqualifying candidates.\nThe exam is random. No-one has the same questions, partly to stop anyone briefing those who are going to take it later in the day or in different time zones.\nThere were 20 cases of cheating across the world in November - including several in Spain, where candidates changed the IP address of the venue's wi-fi, allowing remote access, before changing it back and submitting their answers.\nThe exam is all on one page and exactly the same format as the mocks. I took about 30 practice tests on Fifa's agent platform but found it repetitive.\nOne candidate I spoke to took 144 mock exams but failed by a point. The point of the mocks is to ensure your device is compatible and simulate the exam experience, rather than as a full-blown study aid.\nI chose to pay \u00a3120 for extra, broader questions from a website claiming a 97% pass rate for first-time takers.\nThe exam itself is 'open', so you are allowed to use the 686-page Fifa document - the study materials - in both hard copy and as a PDF.\nI was advised to print it off so arrived with the sections - including the disciplinary code, Fifa statutes and agent regulations - stapled together but struggled to fit them all on the small desk, eventually putting half on the floor.\nDuring my revision, the criticism from most agents about the narrowness of the questions felt valid. For example, one mock exam asked about a document foreword written by Fifa president Gianni Infantino.\nWhen it was real, I had two questions around where agents can operate, one on sell-on clauses, another on parental consent, more on safeguarding and a tough one on worldwide sanctions I later find out I got wrong.\nI finished my 20 questions in 30 minutes - leaving another half-hour to check, second-guess, review and submit.\nThe relief is palpable. A stressful hour is over and everyone filters out.\nAfterwards Abrahams offers his assessment: \"It comes across as a lot of legalese. It was challenging to get engaged with the content.\n\"It makes it more difficult to pass the exam and sums up why the pass rate is so low.\"\nThis was O'Connor's first exam since his GCSEs in 2001.\n\"A lot of it is there to possibly trip you up but if it was easy it wouldn't be doing its job,\" he says. \n\"It's as nerve-wracking as any games I've played in. The relief is the same as when you've come off at an away game and nicked a 1-0 win.\"\nDespite the criticisms, the morning went smoothly. Far better than the September 2023 exams at the NEC in Birmingham and ExCel centre in London where the wi-fi failed and caused chaos.\n\"It was the most stressful time of my life,\" one agent who attended and passed the ExCel exam tells BBC Sport.\n\"It was a shambles. If you failed then any player who was signed to you could leave, you weren't adhering to the new rules so the agreement was invalid. \n\"I could have lost my client base [of about 25 players] in one swoop.\"\nThis video can not be played\nThe Football News Show: Why Nathan Lowe's dad became a football agent\nThe 2015 deregulation opened the doors to more family members becoming intermediaries and there were plenty at Wembley looking to pass.\nAndy Lowe, father of Stoke striker Nathan, was sitting the afternoon exam.\nHe does not have the desire to represent his son directly himself but says a licence would give him the knowledge, and he plans on advising other parents on their agent choices.\nNathan, on loan at Walsall, is a client of Murdock Sports Group, which counts Napoli's Scott McTominay and Manchester United's Jonny Evans as two of its highest-profile players.\n\"A trusted adviser is the best description I could have of a good agent,\" says Andy.\n\"Someone who is aligned with your child's goals and aspirations and is bringing a unique set of skills to the table which help support them. But that can't be the parent. If you are the parent and the agent it could cause difficulties and challenges.\n\"I'm doing it because I want to understand and to keep my agents on their toes. I need them to know I know what this is about. All I care about is my child.\n\"I had to do a lot of research to figure out what made a good agent and why. I'd like that to be more accessible to parents like myself.\"\nOne agent, speaking anonymously as part of this piece, was asked whether family members could make good agents and said \"some are really unreasonable\" which can \"hurt boys' careers\".\n\"Clubs don't want to deal with parents because they are too emotionally involved,\" they added.\nHowever, a sporting director at a top-level club - whose job is dealing with transfers and therefore agents - dismissed suggestions family members cause problems.\nHe described his negotiations with them as \"no more complicated\" than those with a traditional agency around transfers or new contracts.\nA manager, who played in the Premier League during a 20-year career, accepts agents are necessary, even if they can become problematic whoever they are.\nHe said: \"The longer you are in it, you trust certain ones more than others. Sometimes when there's a disingenuous bit of information, that trust can go.\n\"It works both ways. If I'm trying to sign a player and a club doesn't want to lose that player, the agent provides the buffer to discuss what the likelihood of a deal may be.\n\"There will be times that relationship can become frayed and you know if you remove the middle man things will be easier. \n\"But from a player's perspective it's worthwhile having that separation from the finances and negotiations.\"\nAn email from Fifa dropped a week later. It read \"congratulations\" and asked for more money to complete the application process. \nIf you pass, you are not told what mark you got. Only those who fail are informed of which questions they got wrong.\nA text from Brownhill arrives. \"I passed my exam\" and a flame emoji. \nBirthday boy O'Connor has passed too. I am later told the two exams this year had a pass rate of just 40%.\nWhat now then? While I have a Fifa licence and am officially an agent, it does not necessarily make me one.\nIt is like passing your driving test. You are legally allowed to drive a car but do you know the roads? What do you do on the motorway, how do you navigate other road users or obstacles?\nIt is the same in agency. What do I know about negotiating contracts, handling transfer requests for unhappy players or doing multi-million pound deals?\nYet, now I have passed, the licence is indefinite as long as I comply with regulations, make sure my admin is up to date - including continued professional development courses like anti-trafficking and Fifa agent regulations - and keep paying almost \u00a3500 a year to operate worldwide.\nIn the stands and in the bars, pre and post-match, the profession may be misunderstood. Agents are easy targets and there are good and bad operators in every industry.\nIt is not just a case of pass the exam, find a player and make millions. Some - perhaps even a few of those who were in the room at Wembley with me - will still undoubtedly think that.\nThe exam was the easy part.",

The exam was reintroduced last year - having been in place between 2001 and 2015 through member associations - when the sport's governing body made it mandatory for all agents to be licensed by 1 October 2023.Almost half of the 3,800 people who sat the exam in April 2023 failed.The new Fifa licence is designed to boost standards and \"raise the professional and ethical standards of the profession\".From October last year, unlicensed agents were not allowed to work on transfers, contract negotiations or speak to players - although there are about 900 'legacy' agents registered before 2015 who do not have to take the exam.Image source, dean eldredgeImage caption, Agent Dean Eldredge with the late Sven-Goran Eriksson, one of his former clients\"There is that perception, maybe from the outside and unfounded in many cases, that anyone can be an agent,\" says Dean Eldredge, who runs Oporto Sports. The exam may not correct everything but it is the first step in having the minimum knowledge about the international transfer system, how it works, how a player can be registered with clubs or how to represent minors.The exam is broadly welcomed, despite some criticism of the questions. \"There have been a lot of players damaged by not having proper agents - chancers who were able to just fill a form in, pay the money and the next day they're an agent,\" one agent tells me, speaking anonymously.",

        "article_text": "The Oscar-tipped film by RaMell Ross adapts Colson Whitehead's novel about two boys at an abusive \"reform\" school and shoots it from their point of view. The effect is profound.\nThere's no film this year, perhaps no film this decade, that looks and feels like Nickel Boys. The innovative new film from director RaMell Ross is based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead about an abusive \"reform\" school for boys, and provides a revolutionary perspective on the US's racist past (and how it always informs the present), during the era of Jim Crow. This is in part because it focuses on the human experience rather than oppressive systems and punishment, above all through its use of a first-person viewpoint. Ross drops us behind the eyes of Elwood (Ethan Herisse), an idealistic young man living in Florida in the 1960s, a bright future ahead of him. That's cut short when he's wrongfully convicted of car theft and sent to Nickel Academy. The school is functionally a jail, based on a real institution in Florida known for the discovery of dozens of unmarked graves on its property.\nAt Nickel, Elwood meets another young man named Turner (Brandon Wilson), who has a more cynical outlook on the civil rights movement that is unfolding at the time of their imprisonment. Ross frequently switches perspectives, not just between first-person and third-person framing (where the camera is locked to behind the character's head) but also between the viewpoints of Elwood and Turner, letting us see each character how their friend sees them and transforming our view of each in the process. Like the book, it also periodically checks in with an adult Elwood (Daveed Diggs) reckoning with what happened.\nRoss says that the camerawork in Nickel Boys is designed to reflect how every human being is the centre of their own world, but also how they experience the world in a way that they haven't yet processed. \"It's about giving the person \u2013 about giving Elwood \u2013 not the hindsight of ourselves, which is to look at things as if they're meaningful, but just to look at things that will become meaningful,\" he tells the BBC. \"So the narrative will always be secondary to the experience of looking.\"\nAwards Watch\nNickel Boys has been nominated for two Academy Awards. The film earned nods in the Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay categories. Nickel Boys is also nominated for a Bafta award in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. Click here for more on the films getting awards buzz.\nThe way in which Elwood and Turner's individual experiences are presented through the cameras \u2013 which were operated by Ross himself as well as cinematographer Jomo Fray and another cameraman, Sam Ellison, so they could each take breaks \u2013 includes movement mimicking that of a person's eyes; the characters voices' come from off screen, and you see their hands and feet, and sometimes their faces if they look at a reflective surface. Sometimes you really feel the restriction of their point of view, such as when they are getting chased and can't tell how far someone is behind them, or hear menacing noises around the corner in their racially segregated hometown.\nIn order to create that point of view, the practical requirements of shooting in first person were demanding, but also allowed for spontaneity. Ross and Fray did away with a lot of the traditional structuring and planning of shots, and things were adjusted depending on the scene.\nRoss says that \"the blocking became more gestural\" \u2013 more about considering what the character would be looking at, and how to make it so that body parts showed up in frame correctly, than it was about about traditional orchestration of how and where actors moved. For the filming of some of these point-of-view shots, the actor for the character whose eyes we are looking through wasn't even on set.\nNickel Boys isn't the first film to use first-person cinematography, but it's certainly the first mainstream film release to use it in such a profound way. In the past, it's a technique which has mostly been reserved for gimmicky horrors or action films that are often emulating first-person shooter video games \u2013 take for example 2017 Korean film The Villainess, or the (awful) 2015 sci-fi thriller Hardcore Henry.\nNickel Boys goes in the opposite direction to these types of films \u2013 instead of using the first-person point of view in service of pumped-up sensationalism, Ross is looking to throw out traditional narrative form and create something much more impressionistic. It's a striking choice, in particular, for a film based on a novel, when so often such adaptations rely on chunks of diaristic voiceover and rigid structure. Nickel Boys shows how offering a visual window into the things that a character pays attention to is as good as internal monologue in helping the audience to understand them.\nTo Ross, the choice to shoot a lot of the film from the first-person viewpoint seemed obvious. \"Why can't we get closer to our sensibility and subjectivity on screen,\" he asks. In particular, he says, adopting the first person POV \"seemed to me just to be an act that would be refreshing for black folks, to look up on the screen and see their hands are doing something in the world. For many years I've been like, 'Why has no one ever made [a film like] this?'\"\nRoss acknowledges that he is hardly the first filmmaker to use first person \u2013 he cites Harmony Korine's recent experimental action film Aggro Dr1ft (2023) \u2013 but it's the context in which he uses it which sets him apart. His editing collapses scenes together into something resembling stream-of-consciousness, and this experiential viewpoint feels especially significant when applied to Nickel Boys' subject matter: all too often, this era of American race relations and racism is depicted from the outside looking in.\n\"An original concept in the writing process was, 'What happened if you give Elwood and Turner a camera to make their own Hale County, right?'\" Ross says, referring to his acclaimed 2018 documentary Hale County This Morning, This Evening. That film, which made his name, was an extremely intimate, again impressionistic portrait of the black community in the Alabama town of Hale County, where Ross moved in 2009. \"Cameras weren't portable, obviously, they weren't digital in the 50s, 60s and 70s,\" Ross continues. \"And so no one would ever be able to gather enough footage to make something as poetic and as observational as that.\" With Nickel Boys, he and Fray wondered about \"how what people understand to be the image of black people [would] have changed if in the 60s people had access to show their point of view\".\nEllen Jones, journalist and author of Screen Deep: How Film and TV can Solve Racism and Save the World, praises the groundbreaking effect of the film's formal conceit. \"What is so exciting and impressive about Ross's use of the camera in Nickel Boys is that it demands we consider not just the story, but how the story is told,\" she says. \"The first-person position of the camera eliminates the voyeuristic distance from racist violence, which has been typical [in film], and inserts us in the subjectivity of the black characters. That fact that it feels immersive and never gimmicky is nothing short of miraculous.\"\nMore like this:\n \u2022 12 of the best films to watch in December\n\u2022 The 10 films getting early Oscar buzz\n \u2022 The powerful paintings reframing black experience\nThis first person perspective certainly makes it stand out from the many other films about the Jim Crow era: Jones points out how conventional dramas by white filmmakers, such as Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), Mississippi Burning (1988), Green Book (2018) and Hidden Figures (2016), are designed to speak to a presumed white audience by focusing on sensationalised images of black people in pain.\nRoss's break from a tradition of narrative presentation connects back to an appropriately freeform personal essay he wrote for Film Quarterly titled Renew The Encounter. It speaks of decoupling an idea of \"blackness\" from a commodified, mainstream American sensibility. This aim is reflected in Nickel Boys \u2013 as is the expressed desire to \"create the personal-poetic experience of blackness\". His films do this by taking minute everyday experience and expanding it into an entire visual world, aiming, as he puts it in Renew the Encounter, to \"bring elation to the experience of blackness\". Doing this and being honest about history is a delicate balance, but Nickel Boys achieves it: the suffering of its protagonists is included as an honest reflection of their lives, but its presentation is not the film's only goal.\nThe first-person perspective also naturally puts certain limits on what the camera is showing. Some things are missed purely because the eye can only see so much. Others are excluded because the character simply doesn't want to look, such as in one harrowing scene of corporal punishment in which Elwood avoids seeing what is happening to him, the camera's gaze moving to the ground. \u00a0As such, acts of physical violence often happen in the periphery of the frame \u2013 as Ross puts it, Elwood isn't there collecting evidence. \"No one's in the world to show black suffering at the time in which black suffering is happening,\" Ross says, elaborating on his choice. \"That's not the purpose of them being human in the world \u2013 it's just happening because of the larger context.\"\nLooking back at the basis of Hale County, Ross's manifesto for that film (as shared in Filmmaker Magazine) highlights the point: \"participate, not capture; shoot from not at.\" Nickel Boys might be the epitome of this method, as it shoots from behind its characters' very eyes. That \"participation\" is part of the simple reason why the film stands out from so many other depictions of the same period of troubled American history: it prioritises showing how black people live, not just what we have endured.\nNickel Boys is out now in US cinemas and in UK cinemas from 3 January\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Ramon Diaz spent only six months of his near 30-year managing career working in Europe - at Oxford United\nTwenty years ago a Copa Libertadores-winning legend turned up to manage mid-table fourth tier side Oxford United.\nSix months later Ramon Diaz and the rest of his seven-man entourage were blocked from even entering the ground.\nIt seems unlikely anybody will ever join the former River Plate manager, who played for Argentina, Inter Milan, Monaco and others, in winning South America's top tournament - and the League Two manager of the month award.\nBBC Sport tell the story with help from former players Steve Basham, Chris Tardif and Lucas Cominelli, BBC Oxford editor Jerome Sale, and Jean Marc Goiran, the man who brokered the deal and acted as assistant manager, translator and unofficial chief executive.\nFitness coach Pablo Fernandez, translator Guilliano Iacoppi, boss Ramon Diaz, coach Horatio Rodriguez and assistant Jean Marc Goiran (pictured from left to right) were five of the seven-strong party\nIt was December 2004. \nOxford United, the 1986 League Cup winners, were in a slump, having dropped from the second tier to the fourth since 1999 - and were sliding down League Two when owner Firoz Kassam sacked Graham Rix.\nKassam, the club's unpopular owner, invited out-of-work manager Chris Turner to watch their 1-0 defeat by Swansea - and most people thought he was the new manager, including the Oxford Mail, external and some players.\nBut instead... \"It was quite bizarre,\" said former U's striker Basham. \"Five or six guys came in, in a line. They all stood in front of us and none of them spoke a word of English, apart from one translator.\"\nGoiran said \"all the players had wide-open eyes wondering 'who are these guys?'\".\nThose guys were Diaz, head coach Horacio Rodriguez, another coach Raul Marcovich, Goiran, fitness trainer Pablo Fernandez, doctor Rafael Giulietti and translator Giuilliano Iacoppi.\nBut wait, how did it come to this? It all starts in Monaco - where Kassam and Goiran lived and Diaz also had a home having played for the club.\nKassam approached a friend of a friend, Goiran, who has worked as a football agent and consultant, to help him find a manager and the Monegasque suggested Diaz - who had left River Plate in 2002.\nAt the time it was widely reported that Diaz was not being paid to be Oxford manager - and Kassam said he had \"promised him shares in the club in return for success\".\nBut Goiran, speaking 20 years on, says Kassam's company Firoka, but not the club, instead paid Diaz and Goiran consulting fees in Monaco.\nAnd the question many have asked - why did a manager with five Argentine titles and the Copa Libertadores come to League Two Oxford? \nGoiran says it was part of a project to get to the Premier League in five years - but after a bitter ending, Diaz, who is now Corinthians manager in Brazil, never worked in England or even Europe again.\n\"When they first came in, there were grand talks about redeveloping the stadium, putting a new stand behind the goal and taking us into the Premier League,\" said goalkeeper Tardif.\nBack in 2004 there was less foreign involvement in the lower leagues in England, so it was an even big culture shock then than it is now.\nBut many of the players bought into the new training ideas, although some struggled to adapt.\n\"They brought something very new and very fresh to Oxford United at that time,\" said Basham, who played for the club between 2002 and 2007.\n\"It was way before its time. They came in with ideas and the philosophy that probably hit the English game two, three, four years later, certainly in the lower leagues.\"\nRodriguez would be hands-on - with Diaz overseeing things. To some around the club Rodriguez was seen as the traditional boss of the team with Diaz almost a director of football.\nDiaz and his coaches only spoke broken English, so had to communicate via their translator.\nBut Goiran, who was involved on the training pitch too, says Diaz was the manager and had the final say in everything. \nBasham said: \"He [Diaz] would come in amongst the team as we were laid out in our shape and he would take us through with movements. Very different, but it worked. \n\"He'd physically move you, he would then have you alongside him and he'd make the runs and you would make those runs with him.\"\nGoiran said: \"It was a very nice atmosphere. It was a great adventure. We changed the way they trained, the mentality. We taught them they are football players.\"\nThey were popular figures off the pitch too.\nBBC Oxford's Sale said: \"Ramon and his staff were imposing and impressive, but also gentle and friendly. \n\"He once asked me for $100,000 for interviews. I said the BBC wouldn't stretch that far. He said just to bring him a decent coffee next time then.\"\nRamon Diaz and his entourage were popular with the Oxford fans\nIt all started so well. They had been brought in to help the club avoid relegation but four wins and two draws in January got them dreaming of the play-offs - and Diaz was named League Two manager of the month.\nRemarkably it would take over 17 years for another Oxford manager to win an EFL award like that again - Liam Manning in September 2023.\n\"There was an immediate buzz around the ground,\" said BBC commentator Sale. \"The football went up a notch and the fun came back.\"\nDiaz and co had brought in a proper attacking style of football. Fitness and pressing were a big part of it too.\n\"We changed completely the way they play and they started to win,\" said Goiran.\n\"When a player starts to win they have pleasure, the mentality is better, they have confidence.\"\nBasham said: \"They were very much wanting to play football, which suited most of the team. \n\"I love getting the football down, love playing football, love linking play up and working to a strategy. So it was a bit different, certainly from the Ian Atkins [pragmatic lower-league manager who left Oxford in April 2004] times, which I enjoyed too.\"\nOne of Diaz's innovative strategies was leaving three quick players up the pitch while they were defending a corner in case of a counter-attacking possibility.\n\"It was more of a Pep philosophy in terms of total football even at that level,\" said Tardif, referring to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.\n\"It\u2019s great when it's all world-class players but in the lower leagues it's not always possible. They tried to enforce football at its purest form. We tried it. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it failed.\"\nLucas Cominelli was offered a new deal to stay with Oxford, but new manager Brian Talbot did not want any of the Argentines \nThe new management team wanted to freshen up the squad and brought in a host of trialists - some days about half of the people training were trialists.\nOut of those came a few South American signings - midfielder Lucas Cominelli, winger Juan Pablo Raponi and Uruguayan defender Mateo Corbo. Diaz's sons Emiliano and Michael - who was young and never played for the first team - also joined.\nResults were mixed.\nCominelli played 16 times, scoring a long-range effort against Grimsby, and was seen as one of the successes.\n\"Oxford were fantastic,\" said Cominelli, who had once been on the books of Newcastle without making a first-team appearance.\n\"It was really good. I had a good experience, a good memory of it from the fans, the city, the club.\"\nFull-back Corbo remains a cult hero at the club after eight yellow cards and a red card in 13 games.\nRaponi, who had played for River Plate, was too lightweight for League Two but played 10 times.\nEmiliano Diaz, who played seven times, is often mentioned in discussions about Oxford's worst ever players.\nThat was just one of many times he worked with his dad - having played under Ramon at River Plate and been his assistant manager at over 10 teams since retiring.\nCominelli added there were never issues between the England and South American players.\n\"The team-mates were really OK,\" he said. \"It was really welcome. They helped and everything. We had a good dressing room.\"\nBasham added: \"Some [were] good, some not so good. Some fitted in really well. A couple were superb, really worked hard, good on the ball, really good additions to the side. \n\"And then you had one or two that it didn't quite work out for them.\n\"Raponi was very quick, he made an impact at times, but the physical side of the game sometimes was a bit too much for him.\"\nThe falling out between Firoz Kassam (left) and Ramon Diaz (right) over the ambitions of the club proved to be the downfall of the experiment\nAfter the good run in January, though, Oxford's form took a dip, losing four of the next five games.\nAnd things were unravelling off the pitch too.\nDiaz and Kassam fell out over a difference of opinion in the ambition of the club - and over Diaz not speaking English.\nThe manager, plus some of his coaches, missed a few games for work permit or passport reasons.\nBasham said it just \"fizzled out\" as the club finished 15th - nowhere near the top or bottom.\n\"It's almost surreal looking back,\" said Tardif. \"It was difficult for them coming in our level. They weren't quite ready for having to do the basics over and over again. \n\"I really liked them as people. Do I think it was the right match? Probably not.\"\nGoiran was in discussions with Kassam about how to structure the club's marketing and finding investment. \n\"There were a lot of things to do because the club was not professional for me,\" he said. \"I spent about 12 hours per day minimum working on that and we made a lot of progress. \n\"I was more like a chief executive than other things - but I was still close on the training ground.\n\"The relationship between Ramon and Firoz was difficult. They discussed the future and financial things. Ramon didn't feel that Firoz would like to grow [the club].\"\nBasham said: \"I think they had really big plans for Oxford United. They were all pushing in the right direction.\n\"I think they all thought they were close to some sort of deal with Kassam and for whatever reason it all just ended up... yeah, there was a big fallout, which was a real shame.\"\nOnce it was obvious Diaz would probably leave the club, Goiran tried to find another manager for the project.\nDiaz resigned as manager and he and his sons flew home before the penultimate game of the season. \n\"His decision to leave was unexpected and I am disappointed,\" said Kassam at the time - who added keeping Diaz would have cost the club \u00a31m.\nThe Oxford Mail even reported that Rodriguez was set to become the new manager., external\nBut suddenly the entire experiment was over. Before the final game of the season, at home to Chester, Kassam got rid of Diaz's entire backroom staff and appointed Brian Talbot.\nGoiran was offered the chance to stay but said \"I brought these people in and if they're going out I have to go with them\". \n\"Everything was so OK except the relationship between Firoz and Ramon. We had a lot of good plans for the future, a lot of ideas regarding investors to change the club and grow. But it was a bad ending,\" Goiran said.\nAnd it got very messy as Diaz and his coaches bought tickets to watch the final game of the season against Chester and to say thank you to the Oxford supporters.\nBut Kassam ordered his stewards to refuse them entry and an argument broke out 10 minutes into the game - with fans leaving their seats to ask they be let in.\n\"We had to take the car and left everything there. It was not a good ending,\" said Goiran.\n\"I was very sad to leave the club. It was a fantastic time. I did it with my heart plus everything. The feeling I have with the fans was 'wow'. \n\"It's my club forever - I\u2019m always looking at their results. It's a love story between me and Oxford.\"\nThat was the end of all the South American players too.\nCominelli said: \"The club had offered me a new contract. I wanted to stay but the new coach who came [Talbot], he decided all the foreign players [should be] gone.\"\nKassam and Diaz, through his current club Corinthians, did not respond to requests to speak to the BBC for this feature.\nThe following season Talbot was sacked, Kassam sold the club and Oxford were relegated to the Conference.",

The noise of the modern world that we've trained ourselves to filter out becomes conspicuous by its absence. This is probably the best indication that you've entered one of Britain's remote places, and a good sign if you're trying to find a bothy, one of the free-to-use shelters that dot the country's wild areas.\nFounded in 1965, the Mountain Bothy Association (MBA) is a registered charity that maintains \"simple shelters in remote country for the use of all who love wild and lonely places\". The organisation manages more than 100 bothies in Scotland, Wales and Northern England.\nThe system is simple. Bothies are free to use and open to anyone.

I planned to sleep at Nant Syddion bothy before heading to Aberystwyth, the largest nearby town, the next day.

Nant Syddion used to be home to a lead miner and his family and now provides a temporary home for hikers.\u00a0\nGREEN GETAWAYS\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nEvery bothy is an adapted building with a previous life. Most are old shepherd's huts, farmsteads or workers' accommodation. In the early 20th Century, hill farming declined and fewer and fewer people lived in remote locations, leaving many buildings derelict. After World War Two, hiking and mountaineering as leisure pursuits dramatically increased in popularity and those exploring the outdoors began using these abandoned buildings as shelters. The MBA was created by Bernard Heath and a group of friends to restore and maintain them for like-minded individuals.\nRemote upland country takes its toll on buildings; the wind and rain age, erode and wear almost everything. However, arriving at the bothy, I found that everything was watertight and functional. Even the gate and the front door had recently been painted.\nKeeping 100 buildings habitable in some of the remotest parts of Britain is no mean feat. When you factor in that this work is all done by volunteers (and where bothies have toilets, it involves carrying the waste out), it's a step beyond altruism. Each bothy has two maintenance organisers, and work parties are organised for any large-scale or structural jobs, which, Neil Stewart, head of communications at the MBA, told me, are rarely lacking in willing hands.\nAlthough they're maintained, bothies are by no means luxurious. You won't find electricity or\u00a0running water and will be lucky to have a long-drop toilet. Most will have a stove, but there's no guarantee a supply of fuel will be there. Your comforts are carried in, and you should pack as if you're camping, including a tent if the bothy is overcrowded or you don't fancy the company.\nTIPS\nThe company you find in bothies, and the fact that it's completely unpredictable, is one of their unique attractions, according to Phoebe Smith, author The Book of the Bothy. \"In a world where everything is bookable and controllable, I love that you can't do that with a bothy,\" she said. \"You just have to go and turn up, and you could have it all to yourself or you could meet some incredible people and share some incredible memories. [Bothies] connect you with other people.\"\nWhen I arrived at Nant Syddion, there were already two cyclists in the main room who were doing an off-road tour of the area. I laid out my roll mat and sleeping bag in the last unoccupied upstairs room and went to join them.\nAfter introducing myself to the cyclists, Alex and Simon, I prepared a quick meal over my gas stove while they battled to get the fire to take. Built to withstand its exposed position, the bothy had thick walls and small windows, so when the light began to disappear, it got dark quickly. We lit a succession of candles and arranged our chairs in a semicircle around the roaring fire.\nOne of the best parts of bothying for me is that people are drawn to socialise together \u2013 although you're under no obligation if you want your own space. As we warmed up by the fire, one, then two bottles of whisky (something of a traditional drink for bothies) did the round and stories began to flow. We talked about recent hiking trips in the Dolomites and our bothy experiences, arriving at one to find it full of ex-soldiers in the middle of a reunion drinking session. Hours passed and laughter continued until we remembered we had to hike and cycle back out the next day, and reluctantly left the warmth of the main room to sleep.\nA feature of every bothy is the bothy book, where people record their experiences and motivations for visiting. The next morning, I read through accounts ranging from people sheltering from the rain to alleged supernatural happenings. There was an entry roughly every couple of days, indicating a steady flow of people passing through.\nMountain huts around the world\nThe UK's bothy system of buildings adapted as shelters that are freely available and maintained by volunteers is unique, but networks of mountain huts are found in many countries.\nHowever, it's only been in the last decade and a half that bothies have shifted away from being something of a closed society. In 2009, the locations of the MBA bothies were shared online by the organisation. \"It used to be quite a secretive organisation in the sense that people found out where the bothies were by joining the association or just coming across them in the wilderness areas,\" Stewart explained. \"But that was unsustainable with the internet and people using the outdoors. And it was against our charitable aim. If we're providing buildings for people to use, it's logical we have to tell them where they are, we can't leave them secret.\"\nThis move wasn't unanimously popular. Part of the concern was that the people might begin using these spaces as places to party as opposed to a shelter while enjoying outdoor pursuits. But, as Stewart told me, it's not a problem that's unique to bothies. \"We have had examples of drinking parties in bothies, but we're not particularly bothered with that\u2026 There are problems with wild camping in many areas of the country. Up in Scotland, there's a ban on wild camping in one of the national parks because people were littering, leaving rubbish [and] cutting down trees for fires.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n\u2022\u00a0The US homes made from waste materials\n\u2022\u00a0Norway's simple answer to greener, cleaner living\nThe MBA has no way of accurately recording visitor numbers, but anecdotal evidence from their maintenance teams suggests their use has increased with the greater availability of information around them.

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be.

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The 'missing middle' of small businesses\n\u2022\u00a0Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love\n\u2022\u00a0Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things\nWhere do you see Hill House in the next few years?

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The 'missing middle' of small businesses\n\u2022\u00a0Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love\n\u2022\u00a0Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things\nWhere do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?\nMy perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.\nI'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 set itself on a path to a new vision of green urban living.\nThe 1,000-year-old Swedish city of V\u00e4xj\u00f6 sits 450km south-west of Stockholm in the central region of Sm\u00e5land amid a lush tapestry of sylvan landscapes dotted by hundreds of lakes. This is a land known as the Glasriket (\"Glass Kingdom\") that's home to a string of globally renowned glassworks such as Kosta Boda and Orrefors who have created crystalline gorgeousness from fiery furnaces since the 1740s.\nBut that glassmaking heritage is now matched by changemaking: this compact city of fewer than 100,000 inhabitants has become a global beacon in the battle against climate change. Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 set itself on a path to a new vision of urban living that's now been emulated worldwide.\n\"It was a seminar in 1996 led by the mayor, which asked the question: 'What would it be like to live in a fossil free city?',\" explains Henrik Johansson, environmental strategist for V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Municipality. By the end of that meeting, a unanimous vote saw V\u00e4xj\u00f6 become the first city in the world to commit to become fossil fuel free. This has now evolved into a bigger target of climate neutrality by 2030 \u2013 15 years ahead of Sweden's nationwide commitment.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nV\u00e4xj\u00f6's groundbreaking 1990s commitment drew media coverage from as far afield as Japan, with TV crews ironically taking fuel-guzzling long-distance flights to visit the place Johansson wryly describes as \"this crazy town looking to go fossil free\". None of it seems crazy now, however, with V\u00e4xj\u00f6's per capita carbon emissions slashed by more than 70% \u00a0from 1990s levels, all while the city has grown in population by a third and doubled its per capita GDP.\nHere, local buses and council vehicles run on biofuel made from domestic household organic waste. More than 90% of the city's energy, meanwhile, is sourced from forestry by-products and other biomass, with plentiful material coming from the vast surrounding forests. This ranges from sawdust from local timber mills to branches left from tree-felling to make goods for IKEA \u2013 the global design giant born just a half hour train ride away in the town of \u00c4lmhult.\nThe few CO2 emissions that linger in the air stem from personal car users who are still not taking advantage of one of Sweden's best provisions of electric car charging stations, plus places to fill up on non-fossil biofuels such as ethanol.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe boldest transition, though, has seen V\u00e4xj\u00f6 become perhaps the world's leading showcase for large-scale timber architecture, with half of all new builds required to be in wood, sourced from the same sprawling forests that once provided fuel to fire the glasswork furnaces.\nI arrive in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 by train and can't help but start snapping pictures of a station interior unlike any I've ever seen. Stepping off the platform, I enter a seven-storey edifice that hosts both the Central Station and V\u00e4xj\u00f6 City Hall, and everywhere I look, there's wood. Here, timber is used for both structure and decor in a calm, soaring space that also includes a tourist office, exhibition area and eye-catching artworks made from pale wood. It's such a welcoming space that it's been nicknamed the city's public \"living room\".\u00a0\u00a0\nA wooden bridge connects the station with a museum quarter that I explore the next day, featuring the Swedish Glass Museum within the Sm\u00e5land Museum; plus the House of Emigrants, which tells the often revelatory story of Swedish mass emigration to North America.\nThe museum enclave is also home to myriad relocated buildings from past centuries \u2013 I particularly like the windmill as a symbol of ancient green power, built from timbers painted the iconic Swedish shade known as Falu or Falun Red, named after its historic source from mines around the eponymous town.\u00a0 \u00a0\nHeading down to the shore of Lake Trummen \u2013 one of two nearby lakes, along with sculpture-lined V\u00e4xj\u00f6sj\u00f6n \u2013 I potter along a trail of modern sculptures that provides a cultural promenade of contemporary works chosen and voted for by residents. Glass art is celebrated too, with contrasting crystalline creations placed along the cosmopolitan length of Sandg\u00e4rdsgatan that runs through the heart of the city centre to the iconic double-spired cathedral.\nPLAN YOUR TRIP\nHow to get there: A direct train from Copenhagen airport to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 takes 2.5 hours.\nWhere to stay: Modern design hotel PM & Vanner balances luxury with good eco practice.\nWhat to do\" Browse diverse brilliant glassworks dotted through the Sm\u00e5land countryside; head to the surprisingly inspirational IKEA Museum, and visit the lakeside medieval Kronoberg Castle five miles north of V\u00e4xj\u00f6.\nWhere to eat: The vintage decor at Kafe de Luxe celebrates stylish sustainable re-use. Galai offers upscale modern takes on superb Swedish produce in a chic, modern glass-box space.\nWhen to go: May-September for long days of Nordic sun and warmth.\nIt's a beautiful stroll, and I wonder whether people would have been so keen to leave Sweden if 19th-Century life had offered what the 21st-Century nation does. Alongside enviable public services and a famously equable society, I'm getting housing envy staring up at contrasting high-rise wooden apartment blocks that make up the award-winning Kvarteret Geologen residential complex (also known as Trummens Strand), standing tall and proud by the lake.\nHere, I'm joined by Olivia Thim, a sustainability expert for property management firm V\u00f6fab. \"For a long time, we had the tallest wooden building in Sweden,\" Thim says. \"But also a diversity: apartments, sports arenas, schools. We just thought that we should try to build everything in wood first.\"\nAlso with us is architect Karin H\u00e5rd Af Segerstad from leading V\u00e4xj\u00f6 practice Arkitektbolaget, who tells me about the super-strong cross-laminated timber (CLT) used for structural frames, augmented by cedar shaving facades and various interior woods. This swaddling in natural materials is as pleasing to the residents as it is to the eye, she says: \u201cPeople report an improved sense of well-being living surrounded by wood.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022\u00a0How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nFor architects and engineers, V\u00e4xj\u00f6's showcasing of innovative timber builds has been a valuable learning curve. \"People weren't so knowledgeable about wooden high-rise buildings, so we have close collaboration with the local university,\" says Segerstad. \"Every time there was a question, there would be research done.\"\u00a0\nThis includes sensors within buildings to record how the structures perform over years and changing seasons. \"Now we have researchers coming from around the world,\" she continues. \"Many from Austria and Germany, but also places in Africa such as Congo.\u00a0 We have become world pioneers to build in wood. Aesthetic principles are as important as ecological ones.\"\u00a0\nThe environmental drive underpinning V\u00e4xj\u00f6's modern wood architecture is matched by how the city powers its 21st century life. Exploring the city centre, I can see innovative new wooden structures next to historic clapboard buildings, many transformed into trendy shops or atmospheric restaurants, such as Kafe de Luxe where the traditional Swedish dishes rely on produce from the surrounding land and water.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe staying power of wood\nArkitektbolaget is building a new wooden Vias Chapel just outside the city that will provide a 21st-Century echo of Sweden's oldest wooden building, located 40km north of V\u00e4xj\u00f6. A visit to the 800-year-old Granhults Church proves not just the durability of wood, but also how well it works as a medium for art. An ornately painted interior is as ravishing in its own way as Rome's Sistine Chapel, while burnished medieval wooden carvings of various godly figures sit alongside humble timber furnishings.\nMeanwhile, at modern design hotel PM & Vanner, the restaurants focus on local, seasonal and organic dishes, including produce from the hotel's own garden \u2013 while dishes are cleaned using an energy- and water-saving dishwasher. Food waste is turned into biofuel, and the hotel is also part of an innovative textile recycling system.\nBefore I leave, I walk around the wood-decorated offices of local power generator VEAB with CEO Erik Tellgren, who tells me how forest and wood product \"waste\" taken from around V\u00e4xj\u00f6 easily provides all the electricity requirements of the city, in a manner that also helps the battle to mitigate climate change.\nCarbon Count\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 0.35 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"Forest residues left to decompose generate CO2,\" says Tellgren. \"So, using it up helps cut emissions.\" And, he adds, the ash produced from the burned wood is returned to the forest floor as an excellent compost.\nHe smiles as he recalls how V\u00e4xj\u00f6's first power plant, which fired up here beside the lake in the 1880s, burned wood, and now some 140 years later, the town is again relying on the material as it leads the world away from fossil fuels\n\"So we began with wood, and now we come back to it again,\" he says.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Copenhagen's once-industrial port has been planned to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes.\nWhile cruising the canals of Copenhagen in the summer of 2023, my guide pointed out Nordhavn, the city's once-industrial neighbourhood, excitedly claiming it would become the coolest new city in Europe. From the boat, I couldn't see much beyond a few residential buildings and lots of giant construction machinery, but, as an architect, I was interested to know more.\nSo, 12 months later, I returned to Copenhagen and headed back to Nordhavn, just a 15-minute metro ride from Copenhagen's central station.\u00a0\nThis time, standing at \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, the core of the new development, I could see gleaming apartment buildings, high-end office spaces and a cafe-lined boardwalk along the previously industrial harbour. Dozens of people were lying on colourful beach towels spread across the waterfront, all soaking in the Scandinavian summer sun. It was a peaceful, serene scene, with none of the morning commuter chaos I was used to seeing in cities around the world.\nAnd that's because Nordhavn has been specifically designed to make life easier.\n\"Although it looks like any modern district, it's the world's first five-minute city,\" explained my guide, Bente Hoffman from immersive cultural tour company Slow Tours. \"When the project is complete, everything you need will be within a 400m walk.\"\nCommuting is one of the biggest challenges of modern life as it adds so much time into the daily routine. Nordhavn (officially a district of Copenhagen, but described as a city due to its scale and scope) has been designed to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes. It is setting a blueprint for a world where residents can fit in a morning workout before strolling to the office, grab lunch at a cute cafe, have a quick swim at the harbour and still make it home in time to take your kids to the playground \u2013 all before enjoying a cosy candlelit dinner at home.\nImagine doing all of this without driving from one point to another, without feeling exhausted, and being able to repeat it every day while staying carbon neutral.\n\"We are creating a neighbourhood that meets everyday needs and special occasions,\" explained Peter Bur Andersen, an architect from BRIQ Studios that played a crucial role in zoning Nordhavn. \"Everything is within walking or biking distance, minimising the need for commuting. The area also promotes a mostly car-free lifestyle, connected by cycle paths and the metro.\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nCopenhagen is currently the Unesco World's Architecture Capital (until 2026) and innovative solutions for smart living have been brewing across the Danish capital: from Paper Island, designed to focus on public spaces and housing for all income groups; to Carlsberg City District that's built on four pillars of beer production: science, innovation, art and culture.\nHowever, Nordhavn's five-minute city concept is unique. While there are a few 10-minute cities being developed around the world, including one in Seoul, South Korea, Nordhavn's one-of-a-kind concept is the most ambitious urban development project in Scandinavia. It is also the only new urban district anywhere in the world to receive a gold certification for sustainability from the German Sustainable Building Council, or DGNB (the largest network for sustainable building in Europe), according to Andersen.\nIn Nordhavn, sustainability is about more than reducing energy consumption. Every building constructed must consider its social, economic and environmental impact. For example, the Big Bio Cinema \u2013 the city's newest theatre \u2013 is constructed from recyclable materials such as aluminium in case the building ever needs to be demolished.\nTop tips:\nWhen to go: June-August for warmer weather.\nWhat to do: Take a guided walking tour. Explore the design shops in the harbour area. Head to Konditaget L\u00fcders, a carpark rooftop that serves as an open-air public gym. Watch a movie at Big Bio Cinema.\nWhere to stay: Audo House, a former warehouse transformed into a boutique hotel with a caf\u00e9 and concept store.\nWhere to eat:\n- Located on the 17th floor of a former grain silo, Restaurant Silo has impressive views and a seasonal menu.\n- Headed by Rosio Sanchez, a former dessert chef from Noma, Hija de Sanchez Cantina\u00a0is a two-minute walk from the Sandkaj Harbour.\n- Palmar\u00e8s Bike Caf\u00e9 is a unique spot for cyclists, offering coffee, croissants and a bike workshop, with bike parts as d\u00e9cor.\nAnd, according to Anderson, social and economic inclusion has been at the core of all planning. \"It is important to bring back what worked well in history,\" he said. \"We used to have the butcher, craftsman, baker and cheese shop \u2013 that diversity in everyday encounters. The future city should mix recreational, cultural and commercial spaces, all easily accessible within the neighbourhood.\"\nBut until relatively recently, no one would have considered living in this once-industrial district. Irshia Nasreen, an engineer born and raised in central Copenhagen, says, \"While I was trying to find a new neighbourhood to move out of the city centre, I never thought I'd move here.\"\nBente adds, \"I didn't think I would do tourist walks in Norhavn. There was nothing to see.\"\nAfter all, for centuries Nordhavn was a free port filled with cargo ships, grain silos and metal containers. The buildings that existed were warehouses and industrial shipping structures. Then, in 2008, a competition was held to create a sustainable neighbourhood for Copenhagen's future: 179 proposals were submitted and a group of four architectural firms, COBE Architects, Sleth, Ramb\u00f8ll and Polyform were winners.\nThey designed an urban area of \"soft mobility\", where it is easier to walk, bike or use public transport than it is to drive; and put the idea of hybrid spaces \u2013 something that \"avoids creating lifeless spaces and fosters community among residents, employees and visitors\", according to Andersen \u2013 at its heart. For example, in Nordhavn, a multi-storey car park might have a gym on its roof; an apartment building could include a public restaurant; and a hotel could house a concept store.\nAlthough the entire Nordhavn project won't be finished until 2060, it is being developed in islets (small islands), with key areas such as Nord\u00f8 and \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, already complete and full of life, brimming with locals and tourists.

Audo House, a warehouse from 1918, is now a boutique hotel, concept store and cafe. Across the road, MENY food supermarket was once a factory for building guns. Because of the building's protected status, MENY had to use the same walls, windows and ceilings as the former World War Two gun factory to create what is now a futuristic food market. Nearby, the raw steel surface of The Silo still resembled its days as a grain silo. But it has now been transformed into a luxurious 17-storey residential building with a public restaurant.\n\"The beauty of Nordhavn lies in the blend of old and new architecture standing side by side,\" said Hoffman. \"Sustainability is also about preserving the past by repurposing old buildings for modern use.\"\nNasreen moved to Nordhavn in 2023 and says the calm, car-free environment has transformed her lifestyle. \"I love walking around here,\" she said. \"After living in the city centre for 40 years, not hearing the hums of vehicles is refreshing. The proximity of water to all residential areas gives a sense of peace and fresh air. My nephew is awed by the fact that he can swim in the harbour, walk back home for a shower and then go back to the waterfront to enjoy coffee in a cool caf\u00e9. Isn't that amazing?\"\nCarbon emissions:\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 1.57 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nShe added: \"I work from home, and when I need a change of scenery, I head to The Audo House. It's a multifunctional space, so you see tourists checking in the hotel and people shopping for art and furniture while I have a coffee in its cafe on a winter afternoon.\"\nIn the early 20th Century, when legendary Danish designer Arne Jacobsen said, \"Architecture is not just about creating buildings; it's about shaping the environment and enhancing people's lives,\" it was theoretical. A century later, Hoffman is leading curious designers and architects like me on walking tours around Nordhavn. As curious as I am, and perhaps with the same intent, they are looking for answers to the question: can architecture be one of the keys to creating a happier urban environment?\u00a0\nFor Nasreen and many others living in Nordhavn, the answer is a resounding yes.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Copenhagen's once-industrial port has been planned to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes.\nWhile cruising the canals of Copenhagen in the summer of 2023, my guide pointed out Nordhavn, the city's once-industrial neighbourhood, excitedly claiming it would become the coolest new city in Europe. From the boat, I couldn't see much beyond a few residential buildings and lots of giant construction machinery, but, as an architect, I was interested to know more.\nSo, 12 months later, I returned to Copenhagen and headed back to Nordhavn, just a 15-minute metro ride from Copenhagen's central station.\u00a0\nThis time, standing at \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, the core of the new development, I could see gleaming apartment buildings, high-end office spaces and a cafe-lined boardwalk along the previously industrial harbour. Dozens of people were lying on colourful beach towels spread across the waterfront, all soaking in the Scandinavian summer sun. It was a peaceful, serene scene, with none of the morning commuter chaos I was used to seeing in cities around the world.\nAnd that's because Nordhavn has been specifically designed to make life easier.\n\"Although it looks like any modern district, it's the world's first five-minute city,\" explained my guide, Bente Hoffman from immersive cultural tour company Slow Tours. \"When the project is complete, everything you need will be within a 400m walk.\"\nCommuting is one of the biggest challenges of modern life as it adds so much time into the daily routine. Nordhavn (officially a district of Copenhagen, but described as a city due to its scale and scope) has been designed to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes. It is setting a blueprint for a world where residents can fit in a morning workout before strolling to the office, grab lunch at a cute cafe, have a quick swim at the harbour and still make it home in time to take your kids to the playground \u2013 all before enjoying a cosy candlelit dinner at home.\nImagine doing all of this without driving from one point to another, without feeling exhausted, and being able to repeat it every day while staying carbon neutral.\n\"We are creating a neighbourhood that meets everyday needs and special occasions,\" explained Peter Bur Andersen, an architect from BRIQ Studios that played a crucial role in zoning Nordhavn. \"Everything is within walking or biking distance, minimising the need for commuting. The area also promotes a mostly car-free lifestyle, connected by cycle paths and the metro.\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nCopenhagen is currently the Unesco World's Architecture Capital (until 2026) and innovative solutions for smart living have been brewing across the Danish capital: from Paper Island, designed to focus on public spaces and housing for all income groups; to Carlsberg City District that's built on four pillars of beer production: science, innovation, art and culture.\nHowever, Nordhavn's five-minute city concept is unique. While there are a few 10-minute cities being developed around the world, including one in Seoul, South Korea, Nordhavn's one-of-a-kind concept is the most ambitious urban development project in Scandinavia. It is also the only new urban district anywhere in the world to receive a gold certification for sustainability from the German Sustainable Building Council, or DGNB (the largest network for sustainable building in Europe), according to Andersen.\nIn Nordhavn, sustainability is about more than reducing energy consumption. Every building constructed must consider its social, economic and environmental impact. For example, the Big Bio Cinema \u2013 the city's newest theatre \u2013 is constructed from recyclable materials such as aluminium in case the building ever needs to be demolished.\nTop tips:\nWhen to go: June-August for warmer weather.\nWhat to do: Take a guided walking tour. Explore the design shops in the harbour area. Head to Konditaget L\u00fcders, a carpark rooftop that serves as an open-air public gym. Watch a movie at Big Bio Cinema.\nWhere to stay: Audo House, a former warehouse transformed into a boutique hotel with a caf\u00e9 and concept store.\nWhere to eat:\n- Located on the 17th floor of a former grain silo, Restaurant Silo has impressive views and a seasonal menu.\n- Headed by Rosio Sanchez, a former dessert chef from Noma, Hija de Sanchez Cantina\u00a0is a two-minute walk from the Sandkaj Harbour.\n- Palmar\u00e8s Bike Caf\u00e9 is a unique spot for cyclists, offering coffee, croissants and a bike workshop, with bike parts as d\u00e9cor.\nAnd, according to Anderson, social and economic inclusion has been at the core of all planning. \"It is important to bring back what worked well in history,\" he said. \"We used to have the butcher, craftsman, baker and cheese shop \u2013 that diversity in everyday encounters. The future city should mix recreational, cultural and commercial spaces, all easily accessible within the neighbourhood.\"\nBut until relatively recently, no one would have considered living in this once-industrial district. Irshia Nasreen, an engineer born and raised in central Copenhagen, says, \"While I was trying to find a new neighbourhood to move out of the city centre, I never thought I'd move here.\"\nBente adds, \"I didn't think I would do tourist walks in Norhavn. There was nothing to see.\"\nAfter all, for centuries Nordhavn was a free port filled with cargo ships, grain silos and metal containers. The buildings that existed were warehouses and industrial shipping structures. Then, in 2008, a competition was held to create a sustainable neighbourhood for Copenhagen's future: 179 proposals were submitted and a group of four architectural firms, COBE Architects, Sleth, Ramb\u00f8ll and Polyform were winners.\nThey designed an urban area of \"soft mobility\", where it is easier to walk, bike or use public transport than it is to drive; and put the idea of hybrid spaces \u2013 something that \"avoids creating lifeless spaces and fosters community among residents, employees and visitors\", according to Andersen \u2013 at its heart. For example, in Nordhavn, a multi-storey car park might have a gym on its roof; an apartment building could include a public restaurant; and a hotel could house a concept store.\nAlthough the entire Nordhavn project won't be finished until 2060, it is being developed in islets (small islands), with key areas such as Nord\u00f8 and \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, already complete and full of life, brimming with locals and tourists. A metro extension to Nordhavn and Orientkaj opened in 2020, providing easy access from the city centre.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0Kamikochi: Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n\u2022\u00a0How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nAs Hoffman and I walked through Nord\u00f8, I admired the ingenuity of using once-unassuming buildings to create chic destinations. Audo House, a warehouse from 1918, is now a boutique hotel, concept store and cafe. Across the road, MENY food supermarket was once a factory for building guns.

Run by the non-profit International Centre for Responsible Tourism Global, the awards aim to showcase the benefits of tourism and inspire other firms to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nAwards like these are particularly important at a time when tourism is under pressure. With global travel and tourism numbers back to pre-pandemic levels and one in 10 people employed in the industry, the need to improve the sector's environmental, economic and cultural impact is clear. Lifting up businesses that give back to their local communities creates a win-win for tourists and locals alike. And for travellers interested in supporting local culture, having extraordinary nature experiences and a ensuring a responsible travel industry, the winning firms have demonstrated their ability to do that and more.\u00a0\nTess Longfield, head of sustainability communications at Sabre, who sponsors the awards, commented that extraordinary work is being done by all the winners to create a more sustainable and equitable world through tourism. \"It's a testament to the power of responsible travel to make a real difference,\" she said.\nFrom a private ecolodge in South Africa to a volunteering organisation in a Peruvian biosphere reserve, these are the firms to book with in 2024 and beyond:\nThis five-star ecolodge set in 3,500 hectares of South African wilderness is constantly researching pioneering ways of doing things to improve the lives of the local community and protect the fragile landscapes and wildlife that surround it.\nAs well as offering unique tourism experiences to guests, such as guided walks to the flora-rich fynbos and coastal safaris in in waters teeming with great white sharks and dolphins, Grootbos' lodge provides ecotourism jobs to the local community. Profits from the lodge fund the Grootbos Foundation, which gives free skills and business training for hundreds of local people in the areas of hospitality, horticulture, entrepreneurship and biodiversity. It creates a ripple effect that's much needed during a period of serious unemployment in South Africa.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe judging team called Grootbos \"an exemplary business that others can learn from\", praising the way that it constantly pushes the boundaries and explores new ways of developing responsible tourism.\u00a0\n\"Grootbos cares about community and conservation,\" said Phil Murray, fundraising, donor relations and communications manager at Grootbos Foundation. \"Neither can be ignored, and both can mutually benefit from programmes and a responsible tourism business that prizes people and planet.\"\nRajasthan Studio curates art experiences with master artisans in Rajasthan, allowing travellers to experience, understand and value the local culture of the place they are visiting. Travellers can visit master artists at their homes and studios, meet their families, see the process behind making local handicrafts and co-create a personalised souvenir with the crafter.\nThe experiences include an insight into rare and unique art forms like puppetry and the blue pottery of Jaipur, pichwai\u00a0art and sea foam carving of Udaipur, leather juttis and tie dye of Jodhpur and much more. The idea is to build a community of artists and scale the business to different parts of Rajasthan, and eventually across India.\u00a0\n\"Rajasthan as a state is blessed with a wonderful art heritage and travellers are eager to explore every bit of it,\" said company founder Kartik Gaggar. \"But why should we limit it to exploring? We asked the same question and the answer was: let's turn it into an experience.\"\u00a0\nThe judges were impressed with how Gaggar has created an immersive cultural experience that both economically benefits artists and enriches travellers. They called it a \"highly replicable approach\".\nToday, the company offers more than 20 hand-on art experiences in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, with plans to include artists from Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Bundi and Kota in the near future.\nAs this year's protests have been demonstrating, tourism has an impact on local people as much as visitors. Sivatel Bangkok was this year's winner for its innovative approach that brings together local providers to directly help the community.\nThe hotel sources 70% of its ingredients organically and partners with more than 50 local farmers through the Sivatel's Farmer Friends Network. It also supports local producers and fosters a sustainable ecosystem through the \"Sivatel Sustainable Market\", a pop-up market within the hotel where local artisans and food producers can sell their wares to travellers. Uniforms are designed by Folkcharm, a local sustainable fashion brand that supports local artisans.\nPerhaps most uniquely, it runs a \"From Kitchen to Chicken\" programme, diverting hotel food scraps to feed black soldier fly larvae, which are then used as protein for organic chickens at a local chicken farm, where the hotel then sources its meat.\nThe judging panel found Sivatel Bangkok's structured programme based around regenerative agriculture and funding impressive, along with the way it sources and trains local providers.\u00a0\n\"We believe that to live on this Earth, we cannot live alone but must support each other,\" said Sivatel CEO Alisara Sivayathorn.\nWith a business that serves more than six million holidaymakers a year, TUI is one of the best-known tourism brands in Europe. Its deep and comprehensive commitment to inclusivity impressed the judges: the tour operator has devised a unique way to help those with access needs book their accommodations.\nAmong TUI's many initiatives, they have 90 dedicated agents in their contact centre who have had specialist accessibility training; the team has partnered with AccessAble to survey hotels and develop detailed access guides; and also works with Sign Live to provide interpreting services for British Sign Language Users.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022\u00a0The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\n\"Around one in four of the UK population lives with a disability or condition that impacts their daily life,\" said Marina Snellenberg, TUI's accessibility manager, \"and the prevalence of disability rises sharply with age. It's important that TUI consider the needs and expectations of the disabled community, allowing for a sustained and deliverable customer experience for years to come.\"\u00a0\nJudges were pleased to see a major tour operator address the needs of those with access needs so comprehensively, and hope that others will follow their example.\nThis award celebrates a small hotel group in Sri Lanka that is actively decarbonising its operations, showing that even smaller players can take meaningful steps towards sustainability and inspire others while doing so.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a tropical climate like Sri Lanka, air conditioning can consume up to 60% of a hotel's energy needs. Across its 19 hotels, Jetwing Hotels uses renewable energy from biomass, solar PV, solar thermal and biogas for power. In 2023, the hotel group generated the equivalent of the power needed for about 13,490 households through renewable energy alone. The company has also shortened its supply chain, reducing transport emissions, and is now sourcing 40% of their inputs locally to their hotels.\n\"By reducing energy costs and promoting a culture of environmental responsibility among our staff and guests, we ensure that our business practices are not only beneficial for the environment but also economically viable,\" said managing director Dmitri Cooray, \"Our success shows that even the smallest efforts can create a ripple effect, encouraging others to make impactful changes.\"\nThe award founders believe that the travel industry has a responsibility to contribute to the reversal of biodiversity loss and protect nature for future generations by promoting a regenerative approach to tourism. CREES, a Peruvian company offering tours and volunteering opportunities in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, is this year's winner of the Nature Positive award.\nThis educational tourism operation is working to benefit local people and conserve biodiversity at its three research stations in the Manu National Park that are home to one of the longest running and largest biodiversity studies in the Amazon. Guests get to witness conservation efforts first hand, exploring the rainforest in the company of the centre's naturalist guides, and participating in ongoing projects like checking pitfall traps, monitoring birdlife and taking visual surveys of reptiles and amphibians at night. Many of the projects monitor the life of the forest in newly regenerated forest areas, replanted by the team's conservationists, as a way to understand species recovery.\u00a0\nJudges were particularly impressed by how CREES approaches its work, citing its broad and holistic agenda aimed at promoting sustainable alternatives that respect human rights, intergenerational rights, biodiversity rights and the rights of species to ensure long-term sustainable economic development, as key factors in its win.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

It creates a ripple effect that's much needed during a period of serious unemployment in South Africa.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe judging team called Grootbos \"an exemplary business that others can learn from\", praising the way that it constantly pushes the boundaries and explores new ways of developing responsible tourism.\u00a0\n\"Grootbos cares about community and conservation,\" said Phil Murray, fundraising, donor relations and communications manager at Grootbos Foundation. \"Neither can be ignored, and both can mutually benefit from programmes and a responsible tourism business that prizes people and planet.\"\nRajasthan Studio curates art experiences with master artisans in Rajasthan, allowing travellers to experience, understand and value the local culture of the place they are visiting. Travellers can visit master artists at their homes and studios, meet their families, see the process behind making local handicrafts and co-create a personalised souvenir with the crafter.\nThe experiences include an insight into rare and unique art forms like puppetry and the blue pottery of Jaipur, pichwai\u00a0art and sea foam carving of Udaipur, leather juttis and tie dye of Jodhpur and much more. The idea is to build a community of artists and scale the business to different parts of Rajasthan, and eventually across India.\u00a0\n\"Rajasthan as a state is blessed with a wonderful art heritage and travellers are eager to explore every bit of it,\" said company founder Kartik Gaggar. \"But why should we limit it to exploring? We asked the same question and the answer was: let's turn it into an experience.\"\u00a0\nThe judges were impressed with how Gaggar has created an immersive cultural experience that both economically benefits artists and enriches travellers. They called it a \"highly replicable approach\".\nToday, the company offers more than 20 hand-on art experiences in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, with plans to include artists from Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Bundi and Kota in the near future.\nAs this year's protests have been demonstrating, tourism has an impact on local people as much as visitors. Sivatel Bangkok was this year's winner for its innovative approach that brings together local providers to directly help the community.\nThe hotel sources 70% of its ingredients organically and partners with more than 50 local farmers through the Sivatel's Farmer Friends Network. It also supports local producers and fosters a sustainable ecosystem through the \"Sivatel Sustainable Market\", a pop-up market within the hotel where local artisans and food producers can sell their wares to travellers. Uniforms are designed by Folkcharm, a local sustainable fashion brand that supports local artisans.\nPerhaps most uniquely, it runs a \"From Kitchen to Chicken\" programme, diverting hotel food scraps to feed black soldier fly larvae, which are then used as protein for organic chickens at a local chicken farm, where the hotel then sources its meat.\nThe judging panel found Sivatel Bangkok's structured programme based around regenerative agriculture and funding impressive, along with the way it sources and trains local providers.\u00a0\n\"We believe that to live on this Earth, we cannot live alone but must support each other,\" said Sivatel CEO Alisara Sivayathorn.\nWith a business that serves more than six million holidaymakers a year, TUI is one of the best-known tourism brands in Europe. Its deep and comprehensive commitment to inclusivity impressed the judges: the tour operator has devised a unique way to help those with access needs book their accommodations.\nAmong TUI's many initiatives, they have 90 dedicated agents in their contact centre who have had specialist accessibility training; the team has partnered with AccessAble to survey hotels and develop detailed access guides; and also works with Sign Live to provide interpreting services for British Sign Language Users.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022\u00a0The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\n\"Around one in four of the UK population lives with a disability or condition that impacts their daily life,\" said Marina Snellenberg, TUI's accessibility manager, \"and the prevalence of disability rises sharply with age. It's important that TUI consider the needs and expectations of the disabled community, allowing for a sustained and deliverable customer experience for years to come.\"\u00a0\nJudges were pleased to see a major tour operator address the needs of those with access needs so comprehensively, and hope that others will follow their example.\nThis award celebrates a small hotel group in Sri Lanka that is actively decarbonising its operations, showing that even smaller players can take meaningful steps towards sustainability and inspire others while doing so.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a tropical climate like Sri Lanka, air conditioning can consume up to 60% of a hotel's energy needs. Across its 19 hotels, Jetwing Hotels uses renewable energy from biomass, solar PV, solar thermal and biogas for power. In 2023, the hotel group generated the equivalent of the power needed for about 13,490 households through renewable energy alone. The company has also shortened its supply chain, reducing transport emissions, and is now sourcing 40% of their inputs locally to their hotels.\n\"By reducing energy costs and promoting a culture of environmental responsibility among our staff and guests, we ensure that our business practices are not only beneficial for the environment but also economically viable,\" said managing director Dmitri Cooray, \"Our success shows that even the smallest efforts can create a ripple effect, encouraging others to make impactful changes.\"\nThe award founders believe that the travel industry has a responsibility to contribute to the reversal of biodiversity loss and protect nature for future generations by promoting a regenerative approach to tourism. CREES, a Peruvian company offering tours and volunteering opportunities in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, is this year's winner of the Nature Positive award.\nThis educational tourism operation is working to benefit local people and conserve biodiversity at its three research stations in the Manu National Park that are home to one of the longest running and largest biodiversity studies in the Amazon. Guests get to witness conservation efforts first hand, exploring the rainforest in the company of the centre's naturalist guides, and participating in ongoing projects like checking pitfall traps, monitoring birdlife and taking visual surveys of reptiles and amphibians at night. Many of the projects monitor the life of the forest in newly regenerated forest areas, replanted by the team's conservationists, as a way to understand species recovery.\u00a0\nJudges were particularly impressed by how CREES approaches its work, citing its broad and holistic agenda aimed at promoting sustainable alternatives that respect human rights, intergenerational rights, biodiversity rights and the rights of species to ensure long-term sustainable economic development, as key factors in its win.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Released 40 years ago this month, Milo\u0161 Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies \u2013 but the film's critics could be missing the point.\nWhen it premiered 40 years ago, Amadeus drew an initial wave of praise. A historical drama revolving around the rivalry between two composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it went on to win eight Oscars, including for best picture. Milo\u0161 Forman took home the best director prize, Peter Shaffer won for best adapted screenplay and both of the lead actors were nominated: F Murray Abraham, who played Salieri, beat Tom Hulce, who played Mozart.\nBut in the years that followed, a backlash grew over what some people saw as Amadeus's litany of historical errors. An article in The Guardian declared that \"the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is\", and the BBC commented that \"the film plays shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact\". Salieri, critics noted, was no pious bachelor (as attested by his wife, eight children and mistress), and it's after all an odd kind of hateful rivalry when the real Mozart entrusted the musical education of his own son to Salieri. As for Mozart's lewd humor, that cheeky insouciance was actually commonplace in middle-class Viennese society. Most egregiously of all, world-famous Mozart was not dumped in an unmarked pauper's grave. If this is a homage to history, the complaint goes, it's akin to Emperor Joseph II fumbling ineptly on the pianoforte and bungling every other note.\nBut this kind of cavilling may be missing the point. Forman's aim for Amadeus can be seen as radically different from a typical biopic, and that was to use a fictionalised version of an epic clash between musical composers to allegorise the defining global rivalry of the mid-to-late 20th Century: the Cold War. Put simply, the film may have played fast and loose with 1784 because its real preoccupation was 1984.\nThe film opens in Vienna in 1823. Grizzled court composer Salieri howls through a bolted chamber door that he has murdered Mozart, then slashes his own throat. Days later, as he convalesces in an asylum, a priest arrives to hear his confession. It doesn't disappoint. Salieri recounts that as boy he made a vow of chastity to God as an expression of gratitude for, as he sees it, ushering in the providential death of his father to clear the path for his musical development.\nJump ahead some years, and Salieri is now an eminent composer in the court of Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), where he eagerly awaits an introduction to musical prodigy Mozart. That eagerness curdles when he sees the man in the flesh \u2013 he turns out to be a lascivious vulgarian with an ear-splitting cackle. Convinced that God means to mock his own mediocrity, Salieri hurls a crucifix in the fire and vows retaliation. When Mozart's father dies, Salieri seizes on the misfortune with a dastardly stratagem: dupe Mozart into believing that his father has risen from the grave to commission him to write a requiem, then murder him and pass off the masterpiece as his own. Mozart, feverish and besotted with drink, dies, leaving Salieri addled with bitterness and destined for obscurity.\nThe premise wasn't original to Forman. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Pushkin's taut 1830 play Mozart and Salieri, Peter Shaffer wrote a highly stylised play called Amadeus, which premiered in London in 1979. Forman, sitting in on a preview, was entranced by the dramatic rivalry and convinced Shaffer to collaborate with him, not merely to adapt the play for the screen but to \"demolish the original, then totally reimagine it as a film\". Across four irascible months\u00a0cloistered\u00a0in a Connecticut farmhouse with Shaffer, Forman fundamentally rebuilt the narrative with a fresh\u00a0palette of political resonances.\nThe casting process for the coveted roles of Mozart and Salieri rivaled Gone with the Wind in scope and behind-the-scenes intrigue, all of which played out over a year and involved meetings with literally thousands of actors. Kenneth Branagh was nearly victorious in landing Mozart, then got dropped from consideration when Forman pivoted to a US cast. Mark Hamill endured grueling hours of auditions, only to be told by Forman: \"No one is believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart.\" Al Pacino lobbied hard for the part of Salieri, in competition with Mick Jagger, Burt Reynolds, Donald Sutherland and Sam Waterson. In the end, Forman eschewed splashy celebrities for Hulce and Abraham, only to have casting drama explode again when Meg Tilly, slated to play Mozart's wife, Constanze, broke her ankle playing football: she was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge a week before shooting was to commence. With the plot rebuilt and the cast in place, more than one rivalry was poised to come into focus.\nThe Czech-born Forman had been a galvanising force behind the Czechoslovakian New Wave film movement in the 1960s, reaching a climax with his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball, which satirised the absurd inefficiencies of Eastern European communism. The film was initially warmly received within the reformist milieu of the Prague Spring, but when Soviet tanks rolled into Prague the following year and organised Czechoslovakia into the Eastern bloc, Forman, tarred as a \"traitor\" to the state, was forced to flee to the West and found refuge in the US.\nNearly all of Forman's film work thereafter would show glimmers of opposition to Soviet-style censorship, confinement, and concentrated power. His first success in the US, for example, 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, depicted a mental health ward meting out cruelty and coercion to patients under the guise of benevolent care. Audiences barely needed to squint to see the asylum as gulag and Nurse Ratched as the embodiment of the drunk-on-power Soviet bureaucrat. Likewise, Forman's 1996 film, The People vs Larry Flynt, depicted the founder of Hustler magazine squaring off against censorship at the cost of being jailed, locked up at a psychiatric facility and paralysed by an assassin's bullet.\nThe Soviet allegory can certainly be applied to Amadeus. Perhaps Forman was less concerned with hewing to biographical facts as he was with presenting Mozart as a beleaguered type of ecstatic genius who, hostage to patronage, is stifled and finally crushed by the repressive apparatus of the state. Joseph II, absolute ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, is advised at court by a clutch of prudish sycophants who undermine Mozart's achievements and smear his reputation. Whatever its loose correspondence to the late-18th and early-19th Centuries, this critique can be read as a stab at the USSR \u2013 a debilitatingly centralised bureaucracy hostile to insurgent ideas and innovation. But Forman showed that Mozart would get the last laugh. By the events of 1823, Salieri's insipid, state-sponsored melodies have all been forgotten, while a few bars of Mozart draw immediate joy to the priest's face. In the free market of popular tastes, Salieri's mandated drivel has been suffocated by the triumph of genius.\nIn Forman's hands, the Habsburg Empire bears the hallmarks of Soviet power. The masquerade balls, with their bewildering swirl of masked identities, conjure the confusion and paranoia that proliferated under the Soviet system. Salieri's reluctant servant-spy (Cynthia Nixon) carries out covert surveillance, a nod to the 20th Century's KGB, which had thousands of its moles burrow into the private lives of artists and dissidents. Meanwhile, Salieri's heretical burning of the crucifix and war on God call to mind the ideological struggle between a Christian worldview and secular Soviet hubris. (After Abraham's mother \u2013 a pious Italian woman \u2013 saw the cross-burning scene, she browbeat her son so relentlessly that he blurted out what he now tells the BBC was a lie: \"I told her, 'mum, that was an extra \u2013 somebody else threw it in there!'\")\nAnd then there's the mass grave into which Mozart's corpse is dumped. This depiction does not fit the facts of what is known about his death, but it makes sense if read as an indictment of Soviet practices \u2013 the effacement of individual identity and literal mass murder. Grim excavations of these pits continue to this day. Forman, whose own parents perished in Nazi concentration camps, understood the power of this imagery.\nJeff Smith, author of Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist, tells the BBC that Mozart's struggle against the status quo tapped into Forman's own frustrations with Soviet censorship. \"The emperor's fatuous judgment about Mozart's opera \u2013 'too many notes' \u2013 is just the kind of accusation that was used as a cudgel used against avant-garde artists and thinkers to imply their work isn't pleasant or edifying to Soviet ears. Mozart's enraged incredulity in that scene must have mirrored Forman's own longstanding contempt for Soviet stagnation and repression.\"\nShooting took place in 1983 over a six-month period in Prague, which had the virtue of offering basilicas, palaces and cobblestone squares virtually unchanged since the late 18th Century. Even with Soviet power waning, however, Czechoslovakia remained part of the Eastern bloc and Forman was still persona non grata, so a deal was struck: the director would refrain from meeting with political dissidents, and the regime would allow friends of Forman to visit with their repatriated prodigal son.\nForman's own recollections from the shoot centred on the travails of Soviet interference. His landlady warned his phone is bugged. Informers lurked in every room. Two unmarked cars tailed him everywhere, which seemed redundant since his own driver was also a secret agent. In his autobiography, Turnaround, Forman is just shy of explicit about the degree to which themes of Soviet repression leaked into Amadeus. \"As it had to be in the socialist Prague,\" he wrote, \"the spirit of Franz Kafka presided over our production\".\n\u00a0\nPerhaps even more telling is a story he recounts of negotiating with the general director of Czechoslovak film, Ji\u0159\u00ed Pur\u0161, who, as Forman recounted, wanted absolute assurance that the Communist Party would have nothing to fear: \"I assume that politically there is nothing in the script that they could hang their hats on?\" Forman's reply is a model of plausible deniability and acid irony: \"Look, it's about Mozart!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The cinema classic that made Clint Eastwood a star\n\u2022\u00a0The real California scandal that led to Chinatown\n\u2022\u00a0The D-day film that changed how we see war\nF Murray Abraham felt the strain of coercive scrutiny as he was traveling back and forth to the United States to shoot his role in Scarface (1983) while Amadeus was in production in Prague.\nAbraham tells the BBC, \"At the end of every shooting day I had to cross the border to get to the airport in Vienna to return to Hollywood. At the checkpoint, the Czechoslovak Police would make us sit idle at the gate, just as a way to throw their weight around, make you know who's in charge. That sense of bullying and intimidation was everywhere, and even when the Czech people responded with subversive humor, the strain was palpable. We never forgot for a minute that we were under communist surveillance.\"\nThat tension between the US crew and Soviet agents finally burst out into the open on 4 July. The production was shooting an opera scene, and the crew arranged so that when Forman yelled \"action\" a US flag unfurled and the national anthem played in lieu of Mozart's music. Some 500 Czech extras burst forth into emotional song, in effect revealing their sympathies with the West. But not all of them.\nForman recalled, \"All stood up \u2013 except 30 men and women, panic on their face, looking at each other [asking] what they should do. They were the secret police, dispersed among the extras.\"\nAs Amadeus continues to be reassessed at its 40th anniversary, the significance of the Cold War looms ever larger. Paul Frazier, author of The Cold War on Film, tells the BBC that the film brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of Soviet envy: \"Salieri is the Soviet Lada trying to be a Ford Mustang. He can't be as great as Mozart, so he resorts to undermining and manipulating him. This too was the approach of the old USSR towards the West: rather than being better than the West, the Soviets resorted to undermining and discrediting the West at every turn.\"\nHistorian Nicholas J Cull echoes that analysis. \"Think of the Jonathan Swift line: 'When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.' Whether it's the 1780s or 1980s, what you have is true genius facing off against mediocre, conniving bureaucrats. You see this same dynamic at play in a Cold War film like last summer's Oppenheimer, which in some ways is Amadeus with A-bombs. It makes sense that refugee film-makers like Forman and his creative team would be drawn to tell an allegory of communist mismanagement.\"\nNot everyone is sold on the idea that Amadeus wrestles with Soviet totalitarianism. Kevin Hagopian, a media studies professor at Penn State University, says there's a risk of allegorising everything as an unseen Soviet menace, which ends up making art a mere handmaid to politics.\n\"That ultimately becomes a depressingly narrow way to appreciate the dazzling beauty and emotional breadth of Mozart's music,\" Hagopian tells the BBC. Nevertheless, he adds, we can't ignore the political resonances.\u00a0\n\"The allegorical space that satirical Czech film-makers like Forman opened up meant that audiences began to look for, even perhaps invent, allegorical political meaning,\" he says. \"All films could be read against the grain of a regime that lacked not only humanity but any sense of irony about itself. So if Amadeus wasn't really about Soviet-style tyranny, but audiences merely thought it was, well, I have a feeling that would be just fine with Milo\u0161 Forman.\"\nFor his part, Abraham is candid about what he believes are the more contemporary political stakes of the film, as he told the BBC in June. \"Think about how many Americans now idolise Putin. These autocrats are suddenly celebrated again. It's disheartening, truly demoralising, but if Amadeus can help us see our current predicament through fresh eyes, that shows you how powerfully its message still resonates.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.\nA night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How opera can be 'open to everyone'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is the 'land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera House cut ties with its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to a UK study conducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work \u2013 and opera houses are no exception.\nThe pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive the Theatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes \u2013 sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations \u2013 spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.\nA key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. \"Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,\" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentary Take Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne. \n\u00a0\nIn 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: \"I know that many opera companies\u2026 don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.\"\nGlyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the global Race to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. \"We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,\" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. \"We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine.\" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. \"Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,\" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. \"This way everything goes back into the ground.\"\nClimate action\nGlyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.\nThe rooftop of the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, for example, is host to an urban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.\nThe Sydney Opera House \u2013 a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 \u2013 has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021, a survey by the UK's Theatres Trust found that it would cost more than \u00a31bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.\nIn the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than \u00a0630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recent New York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting.\nElsewhere, the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon, G\u00f6teborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on a new project investigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first \"green season\", using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new \"eco-entertainment\" work titled Masque of Might.\nAs the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.\nTake Me to the Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne is on BBC News Channel and on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.\nA night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How opera can be 'open to everyone'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is the 'land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera House cut ties with its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to a UK study conducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work \u2013 and opera houses are no exception.\nThe pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive the Theatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes \u2013 sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations \u2013 spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.\nA key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. \"Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,\" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentary Take Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne. \n\u00a0\nIn 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: \"I know that many opera companies\u2026 don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.\"\nGlyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the global Race to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. \"We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,\" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. \"We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine.\" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. \"Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,\" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. \"This way everything goes back into the ground.\"\nClimate action\nGlyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.\nThe rooftop of the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, for example, is host to an urban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.\nThe Sydney Opera House \u2013 a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 \u2013 has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021, a survey by the UK's Theatres Trust found that it would cost more than \u00a31bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.\nIn the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than \u00a0630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recent New York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting.\nElsewhere, the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon, G\u00f6teborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on a new project investigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first \"green season\", using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new \"eco-entertainment\" work titled Masque of Might.\nAs the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.\nTake Me to the Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne is on BBC News Channel and on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "Is the world of opera becoming more inclusive? A new documentary, featuring conductor Antonio Pappano, explores the mission to open up the art form to everyone.\nConductor Sir Antonio Pappano is renowned for being a warm-hearted \"people person\". But there's one thing that makes his blood run cold: when he hears opera being accused of being an art form that's only for a wealthy elite. \"I get very offended by people who say we're elitist,\" he says passionately in a new documentary. This is \"a misconception that totally distorts the image of opera,\" he adds. \"The fact of the matter is, it's harder to get into a football game in London than it is to get into the [Royal] Opera House.\"\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is 'the land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eight of the most stunning opera houses\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis allusion to the beautiful game is not a frivolous one. When Pappano \u00a0became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (ROH) in 2002, he spoke of his love for popular music by stars such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Oscar Peterson, Joni Mitchell, and for musicals. \"I like football too,\" he added. \"Does that mean you can't like opera?\"\nBack then Pappano was 42, and the youngest conductor to lead ROH's orchestra. Some 700 operas later \u2013 \u00a0with many productions of the French and Italian repertoires; a good part of the Russian; Wagner, Strauss and contemporary works \u2013 and he is the subject of A Time of Change, presented by Zeinab Badawi, and part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera.\nThe documentary follows him from his modest roots, as the son of Italian immigrant parents who came from southern Italy to the UK, who worked hard to make ends meet. \u00a0They passed on their strong work ethic to him, and he learnt how to work with singers from his vocal coach father, flourishing as a musical talent in the \"the family business\". A Time of Change goes on to trace a career that includes assisting classical pianist Daniel Barenboim, through to a recent high, conducting the King's coronation service in May, featuring solos by Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel and South African soprano Pretty Yende.\nThe main focus of the film, though, is Pappano's mission to open up opera to everyone. \"Opera shouldn't cater just to one audience, or be focused on just one corner of the repertoire,\" he says. \"It must be open to the interests of many different people.\" While he asserts that the ROH, like every big opera house, wants to entice young audiences, he does concede: \"I think you have to be honest and say, yes, but younger people can't afford very expensive tickets, can they?\" \u00a0\nIt's true that the price of opera tickets can seem too high to be anything but a rare luxury for most, especially young people.\u00a0Halley Bondy, writing on the arts website Paste Magazine,\u00a0describes herself as someone who has been to the opera many times \"for a millennial\". And although she loves opera \u2013 \"from the hyper-real grandness to the unbelievable talent, to the\u00a0septuagenarian, fur-hatted audience\" \u2013 she\u00a0finds it \"easy to see why places like The Met [Metropolitan Opera\u00a0House\u00a0in NYC] are ailing in sales; young\u00a0people\u00a0just\u00a0don't go. It's too expensive, too arcane, too massive\u2026 The onus is on the opera houses to do a\u00a0better job of catering to the young.\"\nBondy has only managed to attend so often by being treated by a\u00a0\"ridiculously generous friend\" or chasing discounted tickets. \"Like everything else in the world, the opera is a lot of fun if you have gobs of money,\" she observes, but she concedes anyone could get in with the $25 [\u00a319.40] rush tickets, student tickets or\u00a0commercial\u00a0offers \u2013 which make it \"affordable,\u00a0if you just dig a little\".\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nIn opera's defence,\u00a0ticket prices are generally high because it is notoriously costly to produce. All the more reason, argued The Guardian's Charlotte Higgins in February, for adequate government funding. Discussing\u00a0recent\u00a0cuts to\u00a0opera funding, she wrote:\u00a0\"If you starve something, run it down constantly, gradually\u00a0reduce the provision of it so that few can\u00a0afford it, it\u00a0becomes 'elitist'\u2026 And if opera in the form that its creators imagine it becomes for toffs, that is nothing to do with opera itself\u2026 [it is] precisely\u00a0the result of neglect and\u00a0underfunding\".\u00a0\nPappano is also invested in bringing new blood to opera, via schemes like the ROH's \u00a0schools matinees, which offer young people low-cost tickets to opera productions. Also, its Youth Opera talent development programme gives children aged seven to 13 the chance to try its \"rigorous music and drama training\".\n\"We make sure there's a real variety of socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities, and an even gender split,\u201d says Tom Floyd, ROH senior opera manger, talking about its open recruitment system. Most of the young people who join them \"come from families who probably have had no real experience of opera,\" he says.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nOpera for all\nOver at English National Opera (ENO), the company has stayed true to its egalitarian roots of the late 19th-Century, when theatrical producer Lilian Baylis and music director Charles Corri shared a vision of it as a place for \"people's opera\". ENO has \"opera for all\" in its mission statement. It does not assume knowledge of opera; its website has \u00a0key figures of the organisation \u00a0explaining what opera is and how it's made; and \u00a0the site hints at how it skillfully reimagines crowd pleasers, like La Traviata (to be performed this October), in thrilling new ways, alongside daring new work, such as 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, by performance artist Marina Abramovich (November).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"We sing in English to be accessible to the widest possible audience,\" an ENO spokesperson tells BBC Culture. The company offers free tickets for under-21s; discounts for under 35s, and tickets from \u00a310 for all. No surprise, then, that more than half its bookings last season were from opera first-timers.\nStill, in order to survive the cuts to Arts Council England (ACE) funding, the ENO will next year move its main base from the London Coliseum to outside the capital and in so doing will \u00a0qualify for \u00a324m funding over three years.\nOpera must change, ACE chief executive Darren Henley wrote in an article for The Guardian: \"A new generation is embracing opera and music presented in new ways: opera in car parks\u2026 in pubs, opera on your tablet\". In truth, most opera companies are not digital-age dodgers; they have presences on the popular digital platforms, while the hashtag #operaisopen invites new audiences to click through. \u00a0\nStreaming services \u2013 \u00a0like Royal Opera Stream and Glyndebourne Encore \u2013 have dished up productions and events, both popular and esoteric, to reach a wider audience. And there's also opera at the cinema. At ROH, 2022/23 has been its biggest cinema season ever, with more than 1,300 cinemas worldwide having shown or showing 13 productions (opera and ballet), including Madam Butterfly, La Boheme and Aida. The latter, staged in May and June 2023, was conducted by Pappano.\nNurturing promising young talent \u2013 like soprano Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha \u2013 is a passion of Pappano\u2019s, and he's also a role model for young opera conductors, like Avishka Ederisinghe, who says that watching him talking on YouTube was what inspired him to explore the art form.\u00a0\nAs he steps down from his music director roles \u2013 at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome after 18 years, and at ROH next summer, after 22 years \u2013 Pappano is looking forward to change. He will not be hanging up the baton yet: he will succeed Simon Rattle to become chief conductor at the London Symphony Orchestra, his \"dream job\". \u00a0\nHe describes how he grew up in a council flat that was just \"a four-minute walk to Westminster Abbey\"; and that rising from his humble background to conducting the coronation at that same abbey was \"not a bad gig\". Jokes aside, there is a message there that \u00a0he'd love to hand down to a younger generation: \"If you have a vision for what you want to achieve in life, that spark and\u2026 the energy and resilience to keep pushing when you know things will get tough, you can make it in any walk of life.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nTake me to the Opera: A Time of Change is on BBC News Channel and\u00a0on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music \u2013 with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.\nIf asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The radical trend millennials love\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forgotten Soviet genius of music\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?\nThere are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and \u2013 just as vitally \u2013 new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.\nUnsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag \"classictok\" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.\nFor French violinist Esther Abrami \u2013 who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards \u2013 the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. \"I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,\" Abrami tells BBC Culture.\nShe noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. \"I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,\" she enthuses. \"It opened this door to a completely new world.\"\nNigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fan Babatunde Akinboboye enjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. \"I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,\" he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. \"But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,\" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of \"hip-hopera\" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.\nBoth Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. \"I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,\" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts \u2013 taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery \u00a0\u2013 have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. \"It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,\" he explains. \"Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.\"\n'Complex and profound'\nAbrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: \"I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.\"\n\u00a0\nBritish concert pianist Harriet Stubbs is another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple 20-minute concerts from her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. \"I gave 250 concerts,\" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. \"I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.\"\nThe fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. \"I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,\" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a \"Bowie meets Rachmaninoff\" affair.\nInterestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia \u2013 dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery \u2013 both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub J\u00f3zef Orli\u0144ski, meanwhile, uses atmospheric visuals as a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, which The New York Times describes as \"resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos\".\n\"I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums \u2013 the narrative, the photography, the videos,\" Orli\u0144ski tells BBC Culture. \"I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,\" he adds. This is certainly something Orli\u0144ski has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, he wowed critics with his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was \"an incredible experience\" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. \"Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul \u2013 a pop song won't work.\"\nClassical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK's National Youth Orchestra have just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of \"the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager\".\nOrli\u0144ski agrees that classical music has achieved an \"almost hipstery\" status of late. \"It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,\" he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as \"people like Yuja Wang\" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. \"We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward.\" Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. \"I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,\" he concludes. \"[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing.

        "article_text": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music \u2013 with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.\nIf asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The radical trend millennials love\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forgotten Soviet genius of music\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?\nThere are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and \u2013 just as vitally \u2013 new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.\nUnsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag \"classictok\" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.\nFor French violinist Esther Abrami \u2013 who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards \u2013 the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. \"I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away.

        "article_text": "The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.\nIn 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn\u2019t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like Jos\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico \u2013 New Spain \u2013 were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.\u00a0 \n \n - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder\n \n -\u00a0The world\u2019s most mysterious silver cups\n-\u00a0How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence\nThe ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi \u2013 the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years \u2013 is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.\nArchaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account.\nArchaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The a\u00f1il plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn\u2019t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue\u2019s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the a\u00f1il plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered.\nRhapsody in blue\nMaster painters from the Americas are discussed in art history \u2013 if they\u2019re mentioned at all \u2013 as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Ju\u00e1rez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico\u2019s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Ju\u00e1rez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale \u2013 and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Ju\u00e1rez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens\u2019, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue \u2013 if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Ju\u00e1rez died in poverty.\u00a0 If Ju\u00e1rez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe?\nOn the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' \u2018fear of space\u2019 \u2013 the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident \u2013 thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result \u2013 the same as his peers in Mexico \u2013 was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.\nBaltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as \u2018El Echave de los azules\u2019 (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home.\nThe lack of written evidence of the use of a\u00f1il or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren\u2019t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from a\u00f1il by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries.\nThis cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

The rare blue the Maya invented17 August 2018Devon Van Houten MaldonadoFeatures correspondentMuseo Nacional de Arte de MexicoThe colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.In 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.Getty ImagesThe 1,600-year-old murals at the Mayan temple at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 still have vibrant colours, including blue, which usually fades (Credit: Getty Images)Archaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD).",

        "article_text": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier.\nBeware of green. It can\u2019t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment\u2019s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, \u201cvanishes into thin air\u201d. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso\u2019s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nTo dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green\u2019s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour \u2013 one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history.\nDonning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. \u201cLike the vampire,\u201d the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, \u201cshe has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave\u201d. Describing Leonardo\u2019s inscrutable sitter as \u201colder than the rocks among which she sits\u201d, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from \u201ca diver in deep seas\u201d to a savvy operator who has woven \u201cstrange webs with Eastern merchants\u201d. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant\u2019s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was \u201cthe mother of Helen of Troy\u201d and the \u201cmother Mary\u201d.\nLong before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris \u2013 ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh\u2019s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence.\nPerennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt\u2019s kings the path to resurrection.\nFlora and fauna\nFor millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the \u2018The Asp of Jerusalem\u2019. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade.\nAn acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he\u2019d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe\u2019s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012.\nFertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini\u2019s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy\u2019s bump in Jan van Eyck\u2019s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn\u2019t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal.\nAn alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green\u2019s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck\u2019s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao \u2013 his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple\u2019s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it\u2019s green.\nSo green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable\u2019s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting \u2013 a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured.\nThough rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour\u2019s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one\u2019s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation.\nHiding in plain sight\nIn more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin\u2019s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour\u2019s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue \u2013 as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond.\nBelgian surrealist painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist\u2019s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. \u201cEverything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,\u201d Magritte observed to an interviewer. \u201cThere is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.\u201d\nNo contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully\u2019s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse\u2019s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully\u2019s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer\u2019s space, the ficus greens of Scully\u2019s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier.\nBeware of green. It can\u2019t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment\u2019s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, \u201cvanishes into thin air\u201d. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso\u2019s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nTo dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green\u2019s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour \u2013 one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history.\nDonning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. \u201cLike the vampire,\u201d the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, \u201cshe has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave\u201d. Describing Leonardo\u2019s inscrutable sitter as \u201colder than the rocks among which she sits\u201d, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from \u201ca diver in deep seas\u201d to a savvy operator who has woven \u201cstrange webs with Eastern merchants\u201d. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant\u2019s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was \u201cthe mother of Helen of Troy\u201d and the \u201cmother Mary\u201d.\nLong before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris \u2013 ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh\u2019s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence.\nPerennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt\u2019s kings the path to resurrection.\nFlora and fauna\nFor millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the \u2018The Asp of Jerusalem\u2019. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade.\nAn acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he\u2019d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe\u2019s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012.\nFertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini\u2019s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy\u2019s bump in Jan van Eyck\u2019s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn\u2019t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal.\nAn alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green\u2019s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck\u2019s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao \u2013 his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple\u2019s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it\u2019s green.\nSo green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable\u2019s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting \u2013 a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured.\nThough rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour\u2019s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one\u2019s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation.\nHiding in plain sight\nIn more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin\u2019s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour\u2019s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue \u2013 as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond.\nBelgian surrealist painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist\u2019s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. \u201cEverything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,\u201d Magritte observed to an interviewer. \u201cThere is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.\u201d\nNo contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully\u2019s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse\u2019s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully\u2019s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer\u2019s space, the ficus greens of Scully\u2019s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "A hue now associated with innocence once had a murkier meaning: Kelly Grovier looks at the ways in which pink has represented violence and seduction.\nPink is a double-edged sword. While red is raucous and racy, and white is prim and pure, pink cuts both ways. Long before the word \u201cpink\u201d attached itself to the pretty pastel shade of delicate carnations, as we define the term today, the London underworld enlisted it for something rather less frilly or fragrant \u2013 to denote the act of stabbing someone with a sharp blade. \u201cHe pink\u2019d his Dubblet\u201d, so reads an entry for the word in a 17th-Century dictionary of street slang used by \u201cBeggars, Shoplifters, Highwaymen, Foot-Pads and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains\u201d, describing a lethal lunge through a man\u2019s padded jacket, \u201cHe run him through\u201d.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nAt what point the unlikely linguistic slide was made from mortal piercing to mellow pigment, no one can say for sure. But the enticing hue itself, by whatever name it was known before the assignment of \u201cpink\u201d to the colour chart in the 18th Century, has kept culture blushing since antiquity. Now seductive, now innocent, pink is coquettish and coy, sultry and sly.\nRemove pink from the palette of art history and a teasing dimension to the story of image-making would be lost. Edgar Degas\u2019s Pink Dancers would fall flat-footed and Pablo Picasso\u2019s pivotal pink period wouldn\u2019t rise to the occasion.\nA flesh in the pan\nA key moment in pink\u2019s emergence as an essential element in the development of painting is the creation by the Early Renaissance Italian painter Fra Angelico in the middle of the 15th Century of his famous fresco in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy, The Annunciation, which depicts the moment in the New Testament that the Virgin Mary is informed by the Archangel Gabriel that she will become the mother of Christ. Situated at the top of a staircase solemnly ascended daily by pious monks, Fra Angelico\u2019s ground-breaking painting is one into which an observer\u2019s spirit is summoned to levitate.\nCrucial to sparking that mystical lift-off in the fresco is the portrayal of the ethereal Archangel \u2013 who has himself mystically crossed planes of being to swoop into Mary\u2019s material sphere. Never mind the polychromatic wings, what\u2019s most surprising about Gabriel\u2019s depiction is Fra Angelico\u2019s decision to clad him in plush pleats of sumptuous pink.\nWe know from a contemporary artist\u2019s handbook on how to concoct pigments (Cennino Ceninni\u2019s Il libro dell'arte, published a few decades before Fra Angelico painted his fresco) that pink had been traditionally reserved primarily for the rendering of flesh. \u201cMade from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John\u2019s white\u201d, Cennini explains, \u201cthis pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls\u201d.\nBy draping Gabriel in the lushest of pinks, Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh. Pink is the pivot that humanises heaven. No one would ever see the colour the same way again. In the ensuing centuries, artists would invoke pink as shorthand for the blurring of boundaries.\nBloom of Christ\nAs the focus of Renaissance master Raphael\u2019s Madonna of the Pinks, a sprig of blushing carnations handed to the Virgin Mary by the infant Christ, may seem unremarkable enough at first glance. In fact it amounts to a kind of miraculous wrinkle in the fabric of time. According to religious tradition, dianthus (the Greek name for the plant, meaning \u201cflower of God\u201d), did not appear in the world until Mary wept at her son\u2019s crucifixion.\nThe flower\u2019s anachronistic appearance in Raphael\u2019s scene, therefore, tinged with the future blood of the baby who holds it, mysteriously establishes a pink kink in the linear unfolding of the universe.\nOver time, pink would eventually blossom beyond the petals of its complex theologies to inflect a wider array of secular personality, all the while retaining its elusive allure and capacity to tease. By the 18th Century, pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue.\nFamous portraits by the French Rococo portraitist Maurice Quentin de la Tour of Madame de Pompadour and by the English artist George Romney of his muse Emma, Lady Hamilton (later mistress of Lord Nelson), posing as a mythological maenad, reveal how decidedly deconsecrated the colour had become.\nLa Tour\u2019s full-length pastel-pencil portrait of the official chief mistress to Louis XV of France, begun around 1748, is a rumbunctious jungle gym of superfluous pinks that spider across every inch and threaten to suffocate its subject. Here, pink is an energy that vibrates from the sitter to the secular subjects with which Pompadour has surrounded herself \u2013 music, astronomy, and literature.\nPorcelain pink\nA patron of the porcelain trade, Pompadour had famously inspired the minting by the Sevres porcelain factory of a new hue of pink, delicately bruised by dabs of blue and black. To Pompadour, pink was no longer a mere accessory but a partner in crime \u2013 an aspirational second skin into which she grew intellectually and emotionally. She became her colour.\nNo painting embodies pink\u2019s gradual pendulum movement from the spiritual to the secular more vividly than the French artist Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s exuberant The Swing, painted around 1767, between La Tour\u2019s and Romney\u2019s works. Here, a fabulous flounce of flowing rose is frozen in mid swivel as the swinging girl, pillowed in pinkness, flicks loose a silk shoe, attracting the titillated attention of any number of camouflaged male gazes hiding in the bushes around her. We\u2019re a long way from the pink whisper of angels now.\nIn more recent times, pink continues to be seized upon by artists keen to confound our expectations of what notes or message the floral pigment can confidently carry. Having established a formidable reputation in the middle of the 20th Century as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist, eschewing figurative subjects entirely in the 1950s, Canadian-born American artist Philip Guston reached for pink in a dramatic turn back to representational art in the late 1960s.\nBy then, the colour itself had undergone something of a commercial transformation in American retail culture, having begun the century as a shade more often associated with boys and masculinity than fairy princesses and little girls\u2019 dolls. But by the time Guston began introducing a menacing cast of Ku Klux Klan-inspired cartoon goons, whose implausibly pale pink stubby hoods continue to menace popular imagination to this day, the colour had been re-commodified as delicate and feminine. Grabbing pink by the scruff for his unsettling scenes of a seedy Americana, Guston slaps Barbie across the chops.\nAt the same moment that Guston\u2019s provocative pink was poking the art world in the eye, scientific studies were underway by Alexander Schauss, Director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, to determine whether manipulations of the colour could help control the behaviour of subjects surrounded by it. The result of Schauss\u2019s investigation was the concoction of the psychologically subtle shade now known as \u201cBaker-Miller Pink\u201d, after the Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington where the pigment was successfully tested on the walls of inmates\u2019 cells and credited with a significant calming of aggressive urges.\nYet despite its ability to inspire docility, pink is still picking fights, challenging our perceptions to an aesthetic duel. Upon learning that the British artist Anish Kapoor had signed a contract giving him exclusive rights to a recently engineered colour known as Vantablack (the darkest shade ever devised), and the legal right to prohibit other artists from doing so, Kapoor\u2019s younger contemporary Stuart Semple saw red.\nEmboldened by Kapoor\u2019s black embargo, Semple began concocting a supremely-fluorescent pink paint he contends is the \u201cpinkest pink\u201d ever contemplated (\u201cno one has ever seen a pinker pink\u201d, he insists). As a poke in the eye of Kapoor, Semple has made his colour available at a small price to anyone in the world so long as they confirm that they are not Anish Kapoor nor friendly enough with Kapoor to share it with him.

        "article_text": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u2013 and which allows art to swivel between different states of being.\nExpunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton\u2019s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It\u2019s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being \u2013 this world and another, life and death.\nOutside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming\u00a0into a\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European\u00a0royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual\u00a0coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange),\u00a0quickly embraced the linguistic\u00a0coincidence in the 1570s. His\u00a0orange-white-and-blue\u00a0rebel flag would become\u00a0the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion\u00a0of everything from Swiss fire\u00a0engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it\u2019s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully.\nFrom antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth\u2019s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire.\nConvinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latin aurum, meaning \u2018gold\u2019, and pigmentum meaning \u2018colour\u2019) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure.\nA spark to a flame\nIntentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet\u2019s plush orange jacket \u2013 its vibrant rumples flickering like flares \u2013 threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer\u2019s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work\u2019s flustering power would be utterly lost.\nNor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard\u2019s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don\u2019t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo.

How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse\u2019s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion?\nCommissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch\u2019s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other\u2019s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground.

The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt.\nAmber alert\nMunch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte\u2019s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like orange\u201d.

        "article_text": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u2013 and which allows art to swivel between different states of being.\nExpunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton\u2019s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It\u2019s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being \u2013 this world and another, life and death.\nOutside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming\u00a0into a\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European\u00a0royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual\u00a0coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange),\u00a0quickly embraced the linguistic\u00a0coincidence in the 1570s. His\u00a0orange-white-and-blue\u00a0rebel flag would become\u00a0the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion\u00a0of everything from Swiss fire\u00a0engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it\u2019s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully.\nFrom antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth\u2019s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire.\nConvinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latin aurum, meaning \u2018gold\u2019, and pigmentum meaning \u2018colour\u2019) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure.\nA spark to a flame\nIntentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet\u2019s plush orange jacket \u2013 its vibrant rumples flickering like flares \u2013 threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer\u2019s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work\u2019s flustering power would be utterly lost.\nNor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard\u2019s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don\u2019t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange \u2013 not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire.\nAnd so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we\u2019ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel.

        "article_text": "Marcel Duchamp\u2019s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart \u2013 and at its 17th-Century predecessor.\nThis year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history \u2013 a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.\nMore like this:\n- When the Parthenon had dazzling colours\n- The insect that painted Europe red\n- The subversive power of the pipe\nThe work in question is awkwardly proportioned \u2013 over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall \u2013 and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um\u2019, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m\u2019ennuies, or \u2018you bore me\u2019) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making \u2013 found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel \u2013 that he christened \u2018readymades\u2019.\nIn stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, \u201cDuchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.\u201d Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.\nAnyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these \u2018readymade\u2019 swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp\u2019s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp\u2019s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp\u2019s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues \u2013 a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades \u2013 a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp\u2019s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of \u2018A. Boogert\u2019 \u2013 a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert\u2019s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel\u2019s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author\u2019s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp\u2019s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert\u2019s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp\u2019s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life\u2019s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

As yet unassigned to an actual object, these \u2018readymade\u2019 swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp\u2019s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp\u2019s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp\u2019s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues \u2013 a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades \u2013 a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp\u2019s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of \u2018A. Boogert\u2019 \u2013 a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert\u2019s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel\u2019s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author\u2019s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp\u2019s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert\u2019s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp\u2019s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life\u2019s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Truly vibrant red was elusive for many years: until a mysterious dye was discovered in Mexico. Devon Van Houten Maldonado reveals how a crushed bug became a sign of wealth and status.\nAlthough scarlet is the colour of sin in the Old Testament, the ancient world\u2019s elite was thirsty for red, a symbol of wealth and status. They spent fantastic sums searching for ever more vibrant hues, until Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the conquistadors discovered an intoxicatingly saturated pigment in the great markets of Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. Made from the crushed-up cochineal insect, the mysterious dye launched Spain toward its eventual role as an economic superpower and became one of the New World\u2019s primary exports, as a red craze descended on Europe. An exhibition at Mexico City\u2019s Palacio de Bellas Artes museum reveals the far-reaching impact of the pigment through art history, from the renaissance to modernism.\nIn medieval and classical Europe, artisans and traders tripped over each other in search of durable saturated colors and \u2013 in turn \u2013 wealth, amid swathes of weak and watery fabrics. Dyers guilds guarded their secrets closely and performed seemingly magical feats of alchemy to fix colours to wool, silk and cotton. They used roots and resins to create satisfactory yellows, greens and blues. The murex snail was crushed into a dye to create imperial purple cloth worth more than its weight in gold. But truly vibrant red remained elusive.\nFor many years, the most common red in Europe came from the Ottoman Empire, where the \u2018Turkey red\u2019 process used the root of the rubia plant. European dyers tried desperately to reproduce the results from the East, but succeeded only partially, as the Ottoman process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks\u2019 blood, according to Amy Butler Greenfield in her book, A Perfect Red. \nDyers also used Brazilwood, lac and lichens, but the resulting colours were usually underwhelming, and the processes often resulted in brownish or orange reds that faded quickly. For royalty and elite, St John\u2019s Blood and Armenian red (dating back as far as the 8th Century BCE, according to Butler Greenfield), created the most vibrant saturated reds available in Europe until the 16th Century. But, made from different varieties of Porphyrophora root parasites, their production was laborious and availability was scarce, even at the highest prices.\nMesoamerican peoples in southern Mexico had started using the cochineal bug as early as 2000 BCE, long before the arrival of the conquistadors, according to Mexican textile expert Quetzalina Sanchez. Indigenous people in Puebla, Tlaxcala and Oaxaca had systems for breeding and engineering the cochineal bugs for ideal traits and the pigment was used to create paints for codices and murals, to dye cloth and feathers, and even as medicine.\nCochineal in the New World\nWhen the conquistadors arrived in Mexico City, the headquarters of the Aztec empire, the red colour was everywhere. Outlying villages paid dues to their Aztec rulers in kilos of cochineal and rolls of blood-red cloth. \u201cScarlet is the colour of blood and the grana from cochineal achieved that [...] the colour always had a meaning, sometimes magic other times religious,\u201d Sanchez told the BBC.\nCort\u00e9s immediately recognized the riches of Mexico, which he related in several letters to King Charles V. \u201cI shall speak of some of the things I have seen, which although badly described, I know very well will cause such wonder that they will hardly be believed, because even we who see them here with our own eyes are unable to comprehend their reality,\u201d wrote Cort\u00e9s to the king. About the great marketplace of Tenochtitlan, which was \u201ctwice as large as that of Salamanca,\" he wrote, \u201cThey also sell skeins of different kinds of spun cotton in all colours, so that it seems quite like one of the silk markets of Granada, although it is on a greater scale; also as many different colours for painters as can be found in Spain and of as excellent hues.\u201d\nFirst-hand accounts indicate that Cort\u00e9s wasn\u2019t overly smitten with cochineal, more concerned instead with plundering gold and silver. Back in Spain, the king was pressed to make ends meet and hold together his enormous dominion in relative peace, so, although he was at first unconvinced by the promise of America, he became fascinated by the exotic tales and saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown\u2019s coffers. By 1523, cochineal pigment made its way back to Spain and caught the attention of the king who wrote to Cort\u00e9s about exporting the dyestuff back to Europe, writes Butler.\n\u201cThrough absurd laws and decrees [the Spanish] monopolised the grana trade,\u201d says Sanchez. \u201cThey obligated the indians to produce as much as possible.\u201d The native Mesoamericans who specialised in the production of the pigment and weren\u2019t killed by disease or slaughtered during the conquest were paid pennies on the dollar \u2013 while the Spaniards \u201cprofited enormously as intermediaries.\u201d\nRed in art history \nDye from the cochineal bug was ten times as potent as St John\u2019s Blood and produced 30 times more dye per ounce than Armenian red, according to Butler. So when European dyers began to experiment with the pigment, they were delighted by its potential. Most importantly, it was the brightest and most saturated red they had ever seen. By the middle of the 16th Century it was being used across Europe, and by the 1570s it had become one of the most profitable trades in Europe \u2013 growing from a meagre \u201c50,000 pounds of cochineal in 1557 to over 150,000 pounds in 1574,\u201d writes Butler.\nIn the Mexican Red exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the introduction of cochineal red to the European palette is illustrated in baroque paintings from the beginning of the 17th Century, after the pigment was already a booming industry across Europe and the world. Works by baroque painters like Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando and Luis Ju\u00e1rez, father of Jos\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, who worked their entire lives in Mexico (New Spain), hang alongside the Spanish-born Sebasti\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Arteaga and the likes of Peter Paul Rubens.\nL\u00f3pez de Arteaga\u2019s undated work The Incredulity of Saint Thomas pales in comparison to Caravaggio\u2019s version of the same work, where St Thomas\u2019s consternation and amazement is palpable in the skin of his furrowed forehead. But the red smock worn by Christ in L\u00f3pez de Arteaga\u2019s painting, denoting his holiness, absolutely pops off the canvas. Both artists employed cochineal, the introduction of which helped to establish the dramatic contrast that characterised the baroque style.\nA few steps away, a portrait of Isabella Brandt (1610) by Rubens shows the versatility of paint made from cochineal. The wall behind the woman is depicted in a deep, glowing red, from which she emerges within a slight aura of light. The bible in her hand was also rendered in exquisite detail from cochineal red in Rubens\u2019 unmistakable mastery of his brush, which makes his subjects feel as alive as if they were in front of you.\nMoving forward toward modernism \u2013 it wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 19th Century that cochineal was replaced by synthetic alternatives as the pre-eminent red dyestuff in the world \u2013 impressionist painters continued to make use of the heavenly red hues imported from Mexico. At the Palacio de Bellas Artes, works by Paul Gauguin, Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh have all been analysed and tested positive for cochineal. Like Rubens, Renoir\u2019s subjects seem to be alive on the canvas, but as an impressionist his portraits dissolved into energetic abstractions. Gauguin also used colour, especially red, to create playful accents, but neither compared to the saturation achieved by Van Gogh. His piece, The Bedroom (1888), on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, puts a full stop on the exhibition with a single burning-hot spot of bright red.\nAfter synthetic pigments became popular, outside of Mexico, the red dye was mass-produced as industrial food colouring \u2013 its main use today. Yet while the newly independent Mexico no longer controlled the valuable monopoly on cochineal, it also got something back \u2013 the sacred red that had been plundered and proliferated by the Spanish. \u201cIn Europe, as has happened in many cases, the history of the original people of Mexico has mattered very little,\u201d Sanchez told the BBC, but in Mexico \u201cthe colour continues to be associated with ancestral magic [and] protects those who wear attire dyed with cochineal.\u201d\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
