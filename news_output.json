        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nIt had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".\nVance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".\nThe Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.\nBut Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.\nHe alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.\n\n\nMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".\nVance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.\nHe raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.\nThe safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.\nBut Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.\nVance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.\nIn response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".\nNine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIn the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties.\n\"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. \"There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, later shared parts of his speech on X, praising it as \"excellent\". The two reportedly met afterwards, according to German public broadcaster ZDF.\nIn his own speech, Pistorius directly addressed Vance, saying: \"Democracy was called into question by the US vice-president for the whole of Europe.\n\"He speaks of the annihilation of democracy,\" Pistorius continued. \"And if I have understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes... that is not acceptable.\"\nVance also made reference to the presidential election in Romania, which was annulled in December after declassified documents suggested it had been targeted by Russian state interference.\nVance told the conference: \"If your democracy can be destroyed with a few $100,000 of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with.\"\nRomanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said his country remains \"a defender of the democratic values that Europe shares with the USA\". \n\"All RO [Romanian] authorities are committed to organising free and fair elections by empowering citizens and guaranteeing the freedom to vote,\" he wrote on X.\nVance later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the conference, which has otherwise mainly focussed on Russia's full-scale invasion.\nZelensky said during the meeting that more work was needed on planning to end the fighting, while Vance said the pair shared a \"fruitful\" conversation.\nTrump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich, but Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the summit.",

        "article_text": "The UK military is \"so run down\" it could not lead a future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, the former head of the army has said.\nLord Dannatt told the BBC that up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for such a mission and \"we just haven't got that number available\".\nIt comes after Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would \"play its part\" in guaranteeing Ukraine's security after the prime minister was asked this week if he was open to sending British troops as peacekeepers.\nA former Nato chief told the BBC that Britain and France should lead a force of up to 100,000 troops as part of a long-term peacekeeping effort should Russia's war with Ukraine end.\nUS President Donald Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the \"ridiculous war\" in Ukraine would begin \"immediately\". \nTrump then \"informed\" Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, of his plan. \nLord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - agreed that a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops. \nHowever he said the UK would have to supply \"quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it\".\n\"Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster.\n\"I mean, if we were to deploy 10,000 troops, each rotation for six months, that would effectively tie up 30,000 or 40,000 troops and we just haven't got that number available.\n\"So there are some big issues here that today's politicians won't really have considered.\"\nIt comes as Britain's foreign and defence secretaries called on the UK and Europe to \"do more\" to \"share the burden\" of regional security in a joint article for the Daily Telegraph on Saturday.\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen, who was Nato secretary-general from 2009 to 2014, said \"a number of European countries need to step up to the plate\" for any peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, adding that the UK and France should lead that coalition by putting boots on the ground.\n\"I would let military experts determine [the number] but my guess would be between 50,000 and 100,000 troops,\" he told BBC Newsnight.\nAs of October 2024, there were 74,612 members of the UK's regular Army forces (excluding Gurkhas and volunteers), according to the latest Ministry of Defence (MoD) figures.\nThe Army has targets on how many new recruits below the rank of officer it should take on every year, set out by the MoD. These targets have been missed in almost every single financial year since 2010-11, according to a written answer to Parliament last January. \nLord Dannatt said the Labour government would need to \"look at their priorities\", adding: \"Yes, health, education, roads, infrastructure are important, but actually defence and the security of this nation are more important.\"\nThe crossbench peer said he believes the UK government needs to go further than its commitment of increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP - a pledge that they have yet to put a timeline on when it will be delivered.\nZelensky has previously asked for the UK and other European allies including France to send troops to Ukraine for a peacekeeping operation after the war.\nSir Keir last month signed a \"landmark\" 100-year pact with Ukraine, building on the \u00a312.8bn the UK hass already sent to the country, with further commitments of \u00a33bn every year for \"as long as it takes\".\nThe UK will also continue to train Ukrainian troops, 50,000 of whom have been trained on British soil so far.\nDavid Lammy, the British foreign secretary, said he was \"very encouraged\" by his talks on Ukraine with US Vice-President JD Vance on Friday, on the first day of the Munich Security Conference.\n\"We share the view that there has to be an enduring peace,\" Lammy told Reuters news agency following the meeting.\n\"There was an agreement that Zelensky and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal.\"\nHowever, Lammy and his defence colleague John Healey said that Putin had for two decades sought \"to recreate the Russian empire and suffocate the countries around its borders\".\n\"Too often in the past, the West has let him,\" they said in the Daily Telegraph. \n\"We did too little in 2008 when he invaded Georgia, and in 2014 when he first went into Ukraine.\"\nIn response to Lord Dannatt's comments, an MoD spokesperson said Britain's armed forces were \"respected worldwide for their professionalism and excellence\".\n\"Right now, the Ukrainians are still fighting with huge courage.

However he said the UK would have to supply \"quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it\".",

He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe request to drop the charges will require approval by a judge.\nEarlier in the week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove - Bondi's second-in-command - ordered the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office to end the case.\nBove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. \nThe motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case \"would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies\".\nBut several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.   \nSassoon resigned from her post on Thursday and was followed by six of her colleagues.\nShe said dropping the case would set a \"breathtaking and dangerous precedent\".\nThe latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for \"using prosecutorial power\" to influence elected officials.\n\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\nIn a letter accepting Sassoon's resignation, Bove said his office would be investigating the attorney, claiming she had \"lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice\". \nIn a statement, Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle defended the decision to dismiss the charges, saying it showed \"that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\".\nMr Mizelle said that prosecutors who refuse direct orders \"have no place\" in the department.\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. \nIn Sassoon's resignation letter, she also said  Adams' lawyers had met justice department officials and asked for a \"quid pro quo\", saying the New York City mayor could help enforce Trump's immigration policies if the case against him was dismissed.\nBut Adams denied that was the case. \n\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered - nor did anyone offer on my behalf - any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\nAdams, a Democrat, has accused investigators of pursuing a politically motivated case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\nThe New York mayor has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he won the White House. He flew to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida days before the Republican president took office. \nAfter a meeting with US border tsar Tom Homan on Thursday, Adams said he would agree to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to re-establish an office at the city's Rikers Island jail. \nTrump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the case against Adams. \nBut Bove's letter described his instructions to drop the case as \"direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\".\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.\nWhile she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was \"consulting with other leaders in government at this time\". \n\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious,\" she said. \"But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction.\"",

Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.\nBut until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.\nSince then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.\n\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.\n\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"\nAntarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.\nBut warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.\nThe Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appears to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.\n\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"\nAntarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.\nAt the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.\nBut current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.\nThis is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.\nAs well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.\n\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.\nIn recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.\nThis \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.\nThis very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.\nBut, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.\nThe Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.\nDeclining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.\nPolar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.\n\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.\nSea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.\n\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "Cole Palmer started as a false nine against Brighton, but struggled to influence the game\nBefore Friday's Premier League game against Brighton, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said they \"need to find something different\" without a genuine centre-forward currently available.\nAfter being thumped 3-0 while failing to muster a shot on target, presumably the Italian is still searching.\nDespite spending more than \u00a31.5bn since the Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly takeover went through less than three years ago, a recent injury crisis has left Chelsea's squad looking remarkably threadbare - none more so than up front.\nHow have they ended up with no fit strikers to call upon and how do they solve their problems in attack?\nChelsea have signed a lot of attacking players since the takeover.\nThe Blues have forked out \u00a3445m on forwards - but aside from a now-injured Nicolas Jackson none have proved to be a high-quality number nine.\nPierre Emerick Aubameyang was signed for former manager Thomas Tuchel at a cost of \u00a312m from Barcelona, but the veteran was frozen out soon after the German was sacked following a 100-day review from the ownership without a chance to prove his worth. He went on to score goals for Marseille in a sensational season in France before moving to Saudi Arabia.\nThe only other central strikers signed were David Datro Fofana, Deivid Washington and Marc Guiu, all young players at a combined cost of just \u00a334m. None have looked ready for the Premier League, never mind the level required to meet the expectations at Chelsea.\nThe majority of that \u00a3445m went on Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk, Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Cole Palmer - all predominantly wingers or number 10s.\nAnd only Palmer has produced on a consistent basis, having been involved in a league-high 39 goals (26 goals and 13 assists) in 2024.\nFelix remarkably commanded an eye-watering \u00a310m loan fee during his initial spell from Atletico Madrid in 2023, before he re-joined the club on a permanent basis for \u00a345m last summer. He is now on loan at AC Milan.\nJackson has been ruled out for around six weeks with a hamstring injury.\nThe 23-year-old came off injured against West Ham two weeks ago and, although manager Maresca was initially hopeful the Senegal striker had avoided a major setback, scans have since revealed the problem to be much worse.\nFellow striker Guiu, a 19-year-old who has yet to start a Premier League game, is also out injured for a period of \"weeks or months\" after sustaining a groin problem against the Hammers.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Mudryk has been suspended for allegedly testing positive for a banned substance.\nTo compound Chelsea's misery, Noni Madueke seemed to pull his hamstring while setting up a big chance for Palmer at Brighton and went straight down the tunnel for treatment after coming off. Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".\nThat all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone\nMaresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.\nThe France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 league matches in all competitions.\nHe opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.\nBut the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.\nAs a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.\nThey completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.\nSpeaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. In the last third we struggled doing things that until a week or two ago we were doing well.\n\"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.\"\nIt was a similar story in that FA Cup game, with the Blues again dominating possession and completing more passes than their opponents but on that occasion having just one shot on target.\nChelsea's best hope is finding a way to improve Nkunku's level - but without hurting Palmer, who is also starting to decline after his excellent partnership with Jackson has been disrupted.\nEither way, in reality, for all the money spent Maresca is simply short of options.\nPalmer has failed to score in four successive Premier League games for Chelsea for the first time since joining in the summer of 2023.\nDespite the recent lean spell, however, his overall record this season is still strong.\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided six assists and should still be on course to match the 22 goals he managed in 2023-24.\nWhile he has continued to churn out the numbers, though, he has been used in a slightly different - more central - role throughout this campaign under Maresca compared to previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nPalmer's touch map for this season shows how influential he is from central positions within Maresca's usual Chelsea system\nBy contrast, his touch map for last season shows that under Pochettino he operated much more from the right-hand side of Chelsea's attack\n1 of 2\nIn his pre-match interview the Chelsea manager described Palmer as \"more a linking player\".\nHe would have hoped by playing him down the middle at Brighton - albeit this time without a central striker ahead of him - he would be able to drop deeper and feed the wide players running beyond him.\nHis passing map against Brighton shows how much he drifted across Chelsea's forward line in an attempt to influence the game, but for large parts he cut a frustrated figure.\n\"Football is a team, it's not tennis,\" said Maresca when asked about Palmer's recent lack of goals.\n\"It's not only Cole Palmer.

Maresca said afterwards that \"he will be out for a while\".That all meant Chelsea's last three fit senior forwards were all on the pitch after Madueke's substitution - Palmer, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho - with academy winger Tyrique George the only attacking option able to come on in the second half.Latest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022How has Maresca tried to solve the problem?Maresca already hinted at changing his tactics for the game at Brighton because of Nkunku's struggles playing up front.The France international has been in poor form and has scored just one goal in 11 league matches in all competitions.He opted to move Nkunku away from the number nine position, where he struggled in the FA Cup tie with Brighton six days ago, effectively swapping positions with Palmer.But the new gameplan was disrupted by the injury to Madueke, which left Chelsea with just one player in Neto who could run in behind.As a result, the visitors were left with lots of the ball - but with no real goal threat.They completed 648 passes and had 69.4% possession at Amex Stadium but were unable to force Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen into a save.Speaking after the match, Maresca told BBC Sport: \"It is difficult when you don't have a proper number nine. \"Related topicsChelseaPremier LeagueFootball \"This is the worst moment since I arrived but we are still there and we need to finish in the best way.",

        "article_text": "Infant mortality rates have increased in US states which have enacted abortion bans, a study has found.\nResearchers estimate there were 478 infant deaths across 14 states which have outright bans or heavy restrictions - which they say would not have occurred had the laws not been in place. \nThe rise comes after the US Supreme Court reversed a ruling in 2022 that made abortion up to foetal viability a national right, allowing individual states to decide on whether to allow the procedure.\nAlison Gemmill, co-leader of the study, said \"restrictive abortion policies\" could be \"reversing decades of progress\" in reducing infant deaths across the US. \nThe study, published this week by researchers from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, found an increase in mortality rates for babies born with congenital issues, as well as among groups where death rates already were higher than average. \nThis included black infants, as well as for babies whose parents were unmarried, younger, did not attend college, and for those living in southern states.\nAs of January 2025, 17 states have outlawed nearly all abortions, though some have narrow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or the health of the mother.\nStates with some form of total abortion ban are Idaho, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.\nFlorida, Georgia, Iowa and South Carolina ban the procedure beyond six weeks of pregnancy. \nMeanwhile, there are bans in place in Nebraska and North Carolina for procedures after 12 weeks, while it is 18 weeks in Utah. \nSarah Corning, a staff attorney at civil rights organisation the American Civil Liberties Union's (ACLU) of Texas, told the BBC that doctors and abortion care experts had warned that infant mortality would increase in these states after banning or restricting access to abortions.\nShe said OBGYNs were leaving Texas \"because the laws prevent them from adequately treating their patients, and Texans and their babies suffer as a result\".\nIn the states which opted to enact the new laws, infant mortality rates increased to 6.26 per 1,000 live births, compared with an expected rate of 5.93 per 1,000 - a relative increase of 5.6%.\nIn the UK, the infant mortality rate is estimated at around 3.8 per 1,000 live births. Slovenia, Singapore and Iceland have among the world's lowest infant mortality rates, at between 1.5-1.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. \nAfghanistan currently has the world's highest rate, with an estimated 101.3 deaths every 1,000 live births.\nThe study also found an increase in the number of infant deaths in the US from congenital anomalies, rising from an expected 1.24 per 1,000 live births to 1.37 per 1,000 - a relative increase of 10.87%.\nMortality from other causes rose to 4.89 per 1,000 from an expected 4.69, a 4.23% increase.\nAmong non-Hispanic black infants, there were 11.81 deaths per 1,000 live births after the bans, compared to an expected rate of 10.66 per 1,000, an increase of nearly 11%.\nAccording to the research, the increase in infant mortality due to congenital malformations was consistent with women being denied abortions for non-viable pregnancies - where a pregnancy cannot possibly result in a liveborn baby.   \nBut the increase due to non-congenital causes \"is less straightforward\", researchers say.\nThe study also found the ban may be disproportionately impacting disadvantaged populations who are already at a higher risk of infant mortality as well as delays in receiving medical care.\n\"When the state invades our hospital rooms, people are forced to carry fetuses with fatal abnormalities - and either experience a stillbirth or watch their baby die shortly after birth,\" Ms Corning said. \n\"It is shameful that our states' laws create such unnecessary physical and emotional harm.\"\nSeparate research from John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that abortion bans were also linked to increased fertility rates.\nFollowing the overturning of Roe v Wade, which returned control over the procedure back to individual states, researchers found that the number of births per 1,000 reproductive-aged females in affected states rose by 1.7%, or 22,180. \nThe estimated differences in fertility were largest in states with among the \"worst maternal and child health outcomes\", the research suggested.

        "article_text": "A Russian drone has hit the protective shelter over Chernobyl's damaged nuclear reactor, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.\nThe overnight strike at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident caused a fire that has since been extinguished, he added.\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog (the IAEA) said radiation levels inside and outside Chernobyl were normal and stable - but later the plant's chief engineer, Oleksandr Titarchuk, said the possibility of radioactive substances leaking \"now exists\".\nRussia has denied any claims it attacked Chernobyl, stating its military does not strike Ukrainian nuclear infrastructure and \"any claims that this was the case do not correspond to reality\".\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors nuclear safety around the world, said fire safety personnel and vehicles responded within minutes to an overnight explosion. No casualties were reported, the agency added.\nThe agency remains on \"high alert\" after the incident, with its director general Rafael Grossi saying there is \"no room for complacency\". \nMr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\". \nA catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.\nWhile the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.\nThe radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.\nZelensky posted footage on X appearing to show damage to the giant shield, made of concrete and steel, which covers the remains of the reactor that lost its roof in the explosion.\n\"Another 15 metres [50ft] to the side and there would have been a radiation accident,\" Hryhoriy Ishchenko, chief of the agency that manages the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, told reporters, according to local media.\nSince 1990, Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, while he admits the strike was a \"horrendous attack on a very important structure\", he is \"not concerned\" about the radiation risk.\nProf Smith told the BBC a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" below the damaged outer shield covers radioactive particles and dust from the explosion. \nSimon Evans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was head of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, which oversaw the construction of the protective dome in the 2010s.\nHe described the apparent strike as \"an incredibly reckless attack on a vulnerable nuclear facility\". \nThe shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.\nThe strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.\nThere appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.\nMr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.\n\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.\nZelensky claimed the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"definitely not preparing for negotiations\", after US President Donald Trump said Putin had agreed to begin talks to end the war earlier this week.\nThe incident at Chernobyl comes after increased military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, the IAEA said. \nIn December, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching a drone attack on a convoy of vehicles transporting IAEA experts heading to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear station.\nThe agency last year urged restraint when an attack on Zaporizhzhia raised the risk of a \"major nuclear incident\". Russia and Ukraine traded blame over the attack in August.\n\"I'm more concerned about Zaporizhzhia than Chernobyl,\" Prof Smith said. \n\"The reactors [at Zaporizhzhia] are currently shut down but there is more live fuel there.

In December, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching a drone attack on a convoy of vehicles transporting IAEA experts heading to the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear station.The agency last year urged restraint when an attack on Zaporizhzhia raised the risk of a \"major nuclear incident\". \"I'm more concerned about Zaporizhzhia than Chernobyl,\" Prof Smith said. \"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.Zelensky claimed the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"definitely not preparing for negotiations\", after US President Donald Trump said Putin had agreed to begin talks to end the war earlier this week.X/Ukraine militaryX/Ukraine militaryZelensky shared pictures of the aftermath of the apparent strike, including what appeared to be part of a droneAlongside various angles of the hole in the shelterThe incident at Chernobyl comes after increased military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, the IAEA said.",

Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did.

It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

You're entitled to your opinion.\nBut what's not in doubt is that they all went viral on YouTube, which is now 20 years old.\nIt's become the place where 2.5 billion people log on monthly to kill time, be entertained and, sometimes at least, learn something.\nBut it's also been life-changing for some of its breakout stars, like Charlie.\nYou wouldn't recognise him now but millions around the world have watched him, as a baby, chomping on his big brother's digits. \nThat's because he's the star of Charlie Bit My Finger.\n\"It was never not a part of my life, it's always been there,\" Charlie, who's now 18, tells BBC Newsbeat.\nThe 55-second clip has had almost 900 million views since it was uploaded in 2007.\nCharlie says he can't remember the moment, filmed when he was \"about one\" and sitting on Harry's lap.\nHe says the clip's success has made life \"easier\" and helped him get to university where he now studies law.\nHis dad Howard Davies-Carr previously told Newsbeat the family had made an estimated \u00a31,000,000 off the video over the years.\nThe video was sold as a non-fungible token, or NFT, for \u00a3500,000 in 2021.\nBut Mr Davies-Carr said he wanted to keep the boys \"very grounded\" in how they live their lives.\nCharlie shares that view and says he doesn't play the \"don't you know who I am?\" card.\n\"It's not like I use it as an icebreaker or anything,\" he says. \n\"I was never going to use this as a fun fact.\"\nCharlie says he doesn't want to be seen as a show-off, so when asked about himself volunteers \"something else a bit more boring\".\n\"But my friends like to tell people [sometimes], so it's hard keeping it locked down,\" says. \n\"It slips out every now and then.\n\"And people are like: 'Oh that's cool', for like five minutes. Or they say: 'I don't know what that is.'\"\nYouTube was founded on 14 February 2005 by three friends - Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim - all former employees of the online payment system PayPal.\nWhile the first video published on 23 April 2005 was not quite Baby Shark, it did have an animal theme. \nIt was a 19-second clip called Me at the zoo, posted by co-founder Jawed.\nThe founders opened the first YouTube headquarters in an office above a California pizza restaurant.\nIt is now owned by Google and has offices all over the world.\nIn the UK, 82% of adult internet users in the UK have reported using the platform - more than WhatsApp (80%), Facebook (76%) and Instagram (57%).\nNow YouTube is a destination many choose for the latest trailers, reviews and news.\nBut it is music videos which dominate the most-viewed list, with Baby Shark Dance having more than 15 billion watches.\nDespacito by Luis Fonsi has more than eight billion, Shape of You by Ed Sheeran has more than six billion views and PSY's Gangnam Style has 5.4 billion.\nAnd while Charlie's family has been helped by income from YouTube, some of its biggest names have made a fortune.\nAmerican YouTuber MrBeast, a.k.a Jimmy Donaldson, is the most popular YouTuber with more than 360 million subscribers.\nBusiness magazine Forbes estimates that he earned $85 million (\u00a368 million) in 2024, making him the highest-paid creator.\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing in the platform's two decades.\nFact-checking organisations around the world have previously said that YouTube is not doing enough to prevent misinformation on the platform.\nThe site has also been punished for privacy violations, being fined $170m (\u00a3139m) by a US regulator for violating children's privacy laws.\nIn 2023, it was accused of collecting the viewing data of children aged under 13, in breach of a UK data privacy code.\nAnd there has been criticism that, like other online platforms, violent and extremist videos have been available to view despite government calls for their removal.\nJournalist Tamzin Kraftman, who covers technology news, feels while the platform has managed to stay relevant against competition from TikTok and Instagram, there are challenges with combating things like misinformation.\n\"No team can go through everything with a fine-toothed comb,\" she says.\n\"So the question is how they will ensure everything on there is correct and within regulations.\"\nTamzin tells Newsbeat AI could play a big role in helping to deal with those issues, but \"might get things wrong and could ban the wrong channel\".\n\"I think it's how they use new tools to really stop the spread of misinformation that is going to be their golden ticket [going forward].\"\nAnd Charlie doesn't think the platform is \"dying out\" any time soon, years on from his flutter with fame.\nWhile he doesn't remember loads from then, he is grateful for the opportunities it has brought.\nHe has managed to travel \"a decent amount\" and been to the United States, filming a flight-safety video.\nAs for whether he's tried to recreate the bite?\n\"I haven't since I was very young.\n\"I could start charging now.

This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

To do something, we need to sell players.\n\"Our focus now is to win these games. Then we have time to focus on that.\"\nAlthough Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof are out of contract at the end of the season and Jadon Sancho due to complete a permanent move to Chelsea, there are question marks over the futures of United's highest earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford, who has joined Aston Villa on loan.\nAmorim's words will also spark fears homegrown pair Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho might be off-loaded in order for the club to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules which, it has been confirmed, will remain in force next season.\nIn addition to a history of poor recruitment, it appears United have failed to get the most out of the players at Old Trafford.\nScotland midfielder Scott McTominay never appeared to be a regular starter but has excelled since his \u00a325.7m move to Italian side Napoli last August.\nThe 28-year-old has scored six goals in 21 Serie A appearances - and three in his last six as his side have charged to the top of the table.\nEven more startling, Brazilian winger Antony has scored twice in three games since he completed a loan move to Real Betis, having scored just four times in 52 appearances for United since the start of last season.\n\"This is a club with a lot of pressure,\" added Amorim. \"You have to have a base and in this moment we don't have it.\n\"But football is like that. When you reach this level, you have to cope with that.\"\nUnited are hoping to ease their financial situation by developing better young players to sell.\nTheir under-18 team reached the FA Youth Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday with an impressive 5-1 win over Chelsea and highly rated youngster Chido Obi scoring a hat-trick.\nHaving revealed he had injury concerns over some unnamed players for Sunday's Premier League trip to Tottenham Hotspur, Amorim confirmed 17-year-old former Arsenal academy graduate Obi had been called into first-team training.\n\"We have problems this week,\" he said. \"We called some young players to be in our training. We have some data evaluation. He is one of them.\"\nIf there is one club challenging United as this season's chronic underachievers it is Tottenham.\nAlthough the north London outfit have beaten the Old Trafford outfit twice this season, in the Premier League and EFL Cup, and also hammered Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, they still find themselves two points behind, with manager Ange Postecoglou under intense pressure.\nAmorim is a fan of the Australian, but he doesn't feel the situations they find themselves in are comparable.\n\"I am a huge fan of Ange Postecoglou,\" he added. \"He is a good guy and a very good coach.\n\"I understand the connection with me and Ange but, with respect, I am at a bigger club.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

But Clement will surely know a poor result at Tynecastle will nudge him closer to an exit.\nSix weeks ago he might have fancied his side's chances of earning a morale-boosting victory, but Neil Critchley has steadily improved Heart of Midlothian since taking time to assess the squad.\nThey have won four of their five league games in 2025 - with one draw - which is as many victories as in their final 22 matches of 2024.\nCammy Devlin has been pivotal to their resurgence. He tops the table for the number of tackles (23) as well as being joint-top for interceptions in the Premiership in 2025. \nTo get at Hearts' defence, first you have to find a way past the Australia defensive midfielder. His availability after a concussion at St Mirren on Monday could well be key to this game.\nThe loan signing of Belgian striker Elton Kabangu seems to have liberated Lawrence Shankland too, and the Jambos showed the sort of resilience that was sorely lacking earlier in the season when they edged past the Buddies in the Scottish Cup.\nYet, despite the cloud hanging over Clement, Rangers have won each of their past four league games - and all by a margin of at least two goals. It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.\nHistory is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.\nRangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.\nThat record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.\nThis video can not be played\nMOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'\nThird-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.\nThat said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.\nSo, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.\nCould that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?\nHe has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.\nPerhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.\nMight Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?\nIf he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?\nThis video can not be played\nHighlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline Athletic\nEvery new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.\nIt usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.\nThen Thelin pitched up. \nThe Dons had chased the Swede for a long time before landing him and it soon became clear why they had been so patient. Ten wins from their first 11 Premiership games at the start of the season and a dramatic point at Celtic led to talk of a title challenge.\nThelin had somehow turned largely the same squad that saw off Neil Warnock within eight games into one that seemed poised to push Celtic into the new year.  \nHis stock went through the roof and there was even gossip linking him with ambitious Birmingham City.\nBut if his stock rose rapidly, it has dropped even more quickly. Aberdeen have lost eight and drawn one of their past nine league games - as many defeats as in their previous 37 games.\nThey have gone from putting pressure on Celtic in second to fourth - just five points ahead of eighth. Thelin, incredibly, is under serious pressure for his job within two months of being touted as Fergie 2.0.\nHis tactics and style of play have been criticised, with suggestions other teams have now worked him out.\nThe good news for him is the Dons play Dundee next.\nAberdeen's last league win was against Dundee, three months ago, and the last time they won an away league game was against Dundee, almost five months ago.\nTony Docherty's side have conceded more goals (53) and faced a higher expected goals against total (46.1) than any other side in the Premiership this season. \nThey have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. \nOh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.\nAberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. \nHe will know that if he doesn't, he then faces exacting matches against former Dons boss Derek McInnes' new side Kilmarnock, Celtic and third-placed Dundee United.",

        "article_text": "Since Helen Fielding created hapless, middle-class Bridget in the mid-90s, she's divided opinion. As the fourth film is released, women across different generations discuss her impact.\nFretful hedonist and loyal owner of ungainly knickers,\u00a0Bridget Jones\u00a0first appeared in a Nineties newspaper column. Four best-selling books and three record-breaking films later, Helen Fielding's creation can now be seen in a fourth big-screen adventure and, as the figurehead of a seemingly unstoppable British franchise, is routinely compared to James Bond.\nOf course, hapless, middle-class Bridget doesn't race around saving the world from evildoers. She's more likely to be found in a London bar, swigging white wine with her garrulous mates. Either that, or lusting after men, traditionally Hugh Grant's Daniel Cleaver or Colin Firth's Mark Darcy, though she hasn't been entirely indifferent to the rest of the globe; in a bid to seem sophisticated and conscience-stricken she once practiced saying the phrase, \"Isn't it terrible about Chechnya?\" (in original 2001 film Bridget Jones's Diary) and another time, out of pure bad luck, wound up in a Thai jail (in 2004's sequel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason). As for kids, they weren't really on her to-do list until she accidentally got pregnant in her forties (in\u00a02016's Bridget Jones's Baby) and spent the next few months wondering if Mark was the dad.\nSome view the return of Bridget as dire news for feminism: Bridget-bashers despair of the character's ditzy fixation on either invasively cheeky or preposterously chivalrous men, not to mention her obsessive calorie-counting. Last year, following the announcement of the latest film, Glamour magazine ran an article saying, \"Bridget Jones\u00a0was toxic \u2013 we don't need her back\", and dubbing her \"a dreadful and misogynistic role model\". However, others have said that the new film \u2013 in which Bridget gets a 29-year-old boyfriend \u2013 is an empowering treat for women. In The Guardian, Hollie Richardson wrote: \"It is joyous to see a fifty-something mother enjoying a whirlwind of romance and sex.\"\nYou can't discuss\u00a0Bridget Jones\u00a0without at least mentioning Jane Austen, whose romantic comedies Fielding both cannibalises and mocks. Suffice to say, if you need your widows to be elegant and focused entirely on their children, \u00e0 la Mrs Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility, then Mad About the Boy is not for you.\nNow in her early fifties, Bridget (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger; never better) is still grieving for her beloved Mark (killed by a landmine in Sudan, though still present as a gorgeous ghost) and bringing up the couple's two children, with the odd bit of help from her wicked ex, Daniel (Grant; saucy, but subtle). Encouraged by her friends to get out more, our heroine goes back to working as a TV producer, joins Tinder, and soon finds herself having lots of excellent sex with a young parks supervisor, Roxster (One Day's Leo Woodall; disarming), as well as flirting with a sensitive science teacher, Mr Wallaker (Chiwetel Ejiofor; magnetically wry). When things get complicated, Bridget seeks solace in a dodgy serum that's designed to make her lips appear youthfully plump, which leads to some truly glorious screwball comedy and a stand-out intervention from a bemused gynaecologist, Dr Rawlings (Emma Thompson; crushing it).\nFor film critic Larushka Ivan-Zadeh, Mad About the Boy \u2013 as well as marking a rousing return to form for Working Title, the production company known for quintessentially British romantic comedies like Four Weddings and a Funeral \u2013 does its central character proud. \"Bridget has always been the inner voice of a generation, saying what we all think, but can't admit, [with our anxieties] that we're not good-looking enough, that we'll never win a Nobel Peace Prize,\" she says. \"I'm not sure if she's a feminist icon. She\u00a0aspires\u00a0to be one, though, and Mad About the Boy offers this all-round portrait of what it means to be a woman. I loved the first film, but the character has really evolved.\"\nWhat did Ivan-Zadeh particularly relish about the new film? \"That Zellweger/Bridget is allowed to look wrinkly. Am I allowed to say that? Let's just say other actresses, in the age bracket of late-40s to 50s, are either blessed [with] wearing a lot of makeup, have been expensively shot or had work done. And the effect is that they look incredibly smoothed out. In the posters, yes, Bridget looks smoothed out. But in the film, she looks normal. We're not being offered Hollywood perfection. It's wonderful and rare to see a high-profile actress looking like this. It's brave of Ren\u00e9e \u2013 it's also brave of her people! \u2013 to allow her to be seen like this.\"\nAccording to Ivan-Zadeh, such bravery \"says so much about where we are now. Call it the Pamela Anderson effect,\" she says, referring to the former Baywatch star, who has\u00a0reinvented herself in recent years both in real life, with her \"make-up free\" look on the red carpet, and on screen, with her similarly bare-faced\u00a0performance, as 57-year old entertainer Shelly Gardner, in The Last Showgirl. \"It's like middle-aged women are now thinking, 'Oh, I'm allowed to do that!',\" Ivan-Zadeh continues. \"Zellweger and Anderson are of course stunning, beautiful women. But in The Last Showgirl and Mad about the Boy, they do not look flawless or pixel-perfect.\"\u00a0\nFor Ivan-Zadeh, Mad About the Boy's script works because Bridget is never put on a pedestal: \"I love the bit where kids on the school run mistake her for a granny,\" she says. Elsewhere, it's what's\u00a0not\u00a0said, alongside the casting choices, that provides a lovely jolt. \"Something we all do is 'age maths'. I probably shouldn't admit that, but in the confessional spirit of\u00a0Bridget Jones, I will. You sit there and obsessively calculate the relative ages of the romantic leads. Obviously, there's a big gap between Woodall and Zellweger. There's also a bit of a gap between Ejiofor [47] and Zellweger [55], yet in the scenes between Bridget and Mr Wallaker the age gap isn't an issue. It's literally never dwelt on. You just sit there and enjoy it, knowing that historically it used to be very different. It was completely the norm for a female romantic lead to be ten or even 20 years younger than her co-star. It's pleasing to see that imbalance redressed,\" says Ivan-Zadeh.\nAccording to journalist Lizzie Frainier,\u00a0Bridget Jones\u00a0has always \"broken taboos\". Frainier, who has just written a book about her own love life called Main Character: Lessons from a Real-life Romcom, thinks Mad About the Boy's age-gap romance couldn't be more timely. She says, \"I'm 31 and around a year ago, I went out with someone who was 29. Small age gap, no? He brought it up ten times! He said I was the oldest woman he'd ever slept with and called me a Cougar. There is so much prejudice out there.\" She adds, \"I've loved Bridget since I found the book,\u00a0Bridget Jones's Diary, on my mother's bookshelf, when I was 13. I'll never outgrow this character. Obviously she's always going to be older than me, but I think of her as paving the way.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 10 of the best films to watch in February\n\u2022 25 films to look forward to in 2025\n\u2022 The secret to making a Hollywood comeback\nThirty-year-old Olivia Petter, a podcaster and writer whose book, Millennial Love, explores the modern dating scene, agrees that Bridget has a wide fan base amongst thirty-somethings. \"Bridget is a heroine for women my age,\" she says. \"Her scrappy breed of chaos is one many of us can relate to.\" She also believes Bridget has \"feminist traits\". \"She navigates work and motherhood in this new film, and it's the former that ends up saving her, which I find inspiring.\"\u00a0\nPetter draws a link between Bridget's surging popularity and the ongoing success of the Sex and The City TV sequel, And Just Like That, season three of which is due later this year. \"Personally, I love seeing these iconic female characters get older,\" Petter says. \"We've spent way too long fetishising youth and sending the message that a woman's value, particularly sexual value, is limited to her 20s and 30s.\"\nVictoria Smith, 50-year-old author of Hags: The Demonisation of Middle-Aged Women, is all for celebrating older icons, but sounds a note of caution. She was disheartened by a recent\u00a0interview in the Guardian\u00a0with Helen Fielding, in which Fielding said, \"Bridget isn't going to be anyone's old bat.\" Smith exclaims, \"Every generation of women thinks 'Right, we're not going to age like our mums did!' But no generation of women were actually old bats. They all had inner lives and desires. They just got sidelined. So let's not perpetuate that. Let's not say, 'You can only have agency and adventures if you're glamorous'.\"\nSmith was also annoyed by the trailer for Mad About the Boy, and its focus on the buff bodies of both Mr Wallaker and Roxster. She was especially disturbed by the ogling of Woodall's character by Bridget's friends: \"Is it equality to show older women objectifying younger men?\"\u00a0That said, Smith admits \"because there's so much hostility towards women of a certain age \u2013 you know, all that Karen stuff \u2013 I'm actually glad when any middle-aged woman is in the spotlight. And I do feel quite a bit of affection for the character of Bridget, who is at least allowed to air her insecurities. All the focus on body positivity and body neutrality can make women feel ashamed for having anxieties. When I'm the oldest person in the room, I feel self-conscious. I haven't had treatments, but more and more of my peers have. The truth is, it's really hard for women to win. I'm on Facebook and you get men talking about Pamela Anderson, saying 'I can't believe I used to fancy her'. So, yes, despite my doubts, I'll go and see the new movie.\"\nTwenty-nine-year-old writer and feminist Moya Lothian-McLean, has been anti-Bridget since her teens (\"I think she's rubbish!\"), and says nothing could convert her to the cause. What she hates is that Bridget \"is useless in every part of her life\", she says \u2013\u00a0examples of her ineptness in the new film range from her setting a pan of pasta alight to getting stuck up a tree. \"They treat her as a walking punchline. Haven't we got more ideas, in 2025? Are there not other stories about middle-aged women that we can tell?\"\u00a0\nDespite the fact that Bridget, in Mad About the Boy, is shown to be a competent TV producer, who knows her stuff about the environment and government policy, Lothian-McLean is still unimpressed. She think that TV portrayals of working women \u2013 for example, the Sharon Horgan shows Catastrophe and Motherland \u2013 offer insights that are \"so much sharper, so much more satirical\".\nLothian-McLean finds it especially infuriating when Bridget is referred to as an \"everywoman\", pointing out that Bridget lives in the affluent North London enclave of Hampstead and that her kids go to private school. \"Maybe she's an everywoman for people who live in Hampstead. For that community, I guess, she's average. But not for the rest of us.\" Yet even Lothian-McLean says she's \"bound to see\" Mad About the Boy. \"My friends are making worrying noises about using our Cineworld pass for it (we go every week).\"\nAre Gen Z girls excited about Bridget? Ivan-Zadeh says that her eldest daughter (13), is desperate to know more about Mad About the Boy (which, by the way, is a certificate 15). \"It's because she's on TikTok and she's being told it's worth seeing.\" Ivan-Zadeh believes younger viewers will find Bridget intriguing. \"Bridget isn't spiky, edgy, scary or misanthropic. She's not in the Fleabag mould. And it's the right time for that. If the film-makers had made Bridget more like Fleabag it would be quite dating. Bridget's the kind of female icon we haven't seen for a while. She's not a caricature. Though clearly insecure and vulnerable, she tries hard to be caring and supportive. You understand why the men adore her. You understand why her friends and children adore her. She's just a jolly nice person. To young people, I think, Mad About the Boy will feel quite new.\"\u00a0\nHere's something Gen X, Y and Z can agree on: whether you love, loathe or merely like Bridget, she's become a must-see.\u00a0\nBridget Jones: Mad about the Boy is available to stream on Peacock in the US and is out now in cinemas internationally.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Solitary lifestyles can have some big advantages in the animal world. Can humans learn anything from them?\nThe Middle East blind mole rat is the ultimate introvert. Residing about a foot underground, it digs out its own tunnel systems where it stays for most of its life, gathering roots, tubers, and bulbs. Each mole rat has its own territory \u2013 for good reason; if one mole rat accidentally burrows into another one's tunnel, the rodents will bare their teeth or bite each other in violent, often deadly battles.\u00a0\nBlind mole rats generally only interact with others of their species during the mating season, but even then, they must proceed cautiously. The male digs through the soil towards a female but pauses before entering her tunnel. For several days, they send vibrational signals to each other by drumming on the tunnel ceiling with their heads. Only when the female expresses an interest to meet will the male advance, mate with her, and leave. After closing the tunnel behind him, he continues his reclusive way of life.\nSolitary lifestyles such as this are remarkably widespread across the animal kingdom. Even among mammals \u2013 a generally sociable bunch \u2013 22% of studied species are largely solitary, meaning that males and females sleep and forage or hunt alone for most of the time.\nBut solitary animals have received relatively little attention from scientists. Perhaps because we are social creatures ourselves, we've been more drawn to studying creatures that cooperate in groups for protection or to find food, breed and raise young. Experts say that for a long time, many scientists have tended to overlook the solitary life, deeming it a more primitive, basic state of existence, associated with anti-social behaviour and poor intelligence.\u00a0\nBut researchers are now coming to recognise that some animals have evolved to be solitary precisely because it can be so beneficial to avoid the competition and stressful conditions of group living. To boot, many solitary animals are in fact highly intelligent and live diverse and complex social lives, despite their solitude. Though blind mole rats are an exception, many solitary animals do tolerate, learn from and occasionally even cooperate with others of their kind, allowing them to enjoy the best of both worlds.\nAs humans are increasingly spending more time alone, these animals remind us of the many benefits of solitude and that living alone does not equal lonely \u2013 a thought perhaps worth considering for people spending Valentine's Day alone.\n\"Maybe by studying solitary species and how they succeed with this tactic\u2026 we can also better identify for human society what is good about being alone,\" says behavioural ecologist Carsten Schradin of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique in Strasbourg, France, and co-author of a 2024 review about solitary living in mammals.\nLiving in groups certainly has many benefits. Think of zebras that find safety in herds and lions that often hunt together to overcome prey larger and faster than themselves. Some birds collaborate to raise young and chimps that socialise by picking parasites off each other. But it also has downsides. In a group, \"every shelter has to be shared, every bit of food has to be shared, every access to a mate has to be shared\", says David Scheel, a behavioural ecologist at Alaska Pacific University. \"Or if it's not shareable, only one of you can get it.\"\nAnd while hunting together and sharing food makes sense for animals like lions that are often surrounded by abundant, large prey that can feed multiple individuals, this is less beneficial in situations where prey is smaller and less shareable. Nor is it as helpful when prey is scattered throughout the landscape where it takes more effort to find them.\nThis is probably why armadillos and anteaters forage alone for few-and-far-between insects, and why tigers \u2013 which roam far and wide to find relatively scarce prey \u2013 hunt by themselves, helping them to sneak up on their prey more easily. To further reduce competition, tigers and some other solitary hunters form small territories that they defend from other predators.\nFor blind mole rats, solitude means not needing to constantly compete for tunnel space, which takes a lot of energy to dig. Solitary animals may also face less competition for mates and a reduced risk of contracting diseases and parasites. Meanwhile, young-raising females can invest all their energy into caring for their own offspring without having to tend to their neighbours' young, like some more social species do. For other creatures, like sloths, their camouflage may only work if they're not in large groups.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If you're solitary-living, you're less conspicuous,\" says Lindelani Mayuka, a zoologist from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa and co-author of the review with Schradin.\u00a0\nLiving alone does create other challenges \u2013 such as missing out on the benefit of huddling together to stay warm. But some animals like the bush Karoo rat of southern Africa get around this by building big stick lodges to protect themselves from temperature swings as well as predators, Mayuka says.\nFor highly social animals, being alone can be stressful \u2013 often leading to poor health and anxiety \u2013 but solitary animals do just fine. In fact, Middle East blind mole rats become stressed and anxious when they're placed next to one another, even if there's a barrier between them, with smaller, more submissive individuals suffering the most.\u00a0\n\"They can die from the stress that they have,\" says Tali Kimchi, a behavioural neuroscientist at the Weizmann Institute in Israel who studies the blind mole rats in her laboratory. Like all mammals, blind mole rat mothers tend to their offspring, but mums eventually become hostile, forcing their young to dig away from her tunnel. \"It sounds funny, but that's the survival of these creatures,\" she says.\nNot all solitary species actively repel each other. Many of them are drawn together by shared resources and have surprisingly rich social lives, tolerating each other and even cooperating when it makes sense. For example, bush Karoo rats that live close to related individuals have frequent, amicable interactions with one another \u2013 sharing foraging grounds with related females and sometimes even stick lodges at the end of the breeding season when there\u2019s a great demand for stock lodges.\n\"Just because some animals are solitary living does not mean that they do not have social interactions,\" Mayuka says.\nEven some octopuses \u2013 a group once considered so solitary it was a running joke that they'd only meet to mate or eat each other \u2013 sometimes aggregate, Scheel says. At one site in Jervis Bay in eastern Australia, individuals of a species called the gloomy octopus are drawn together by the availability of shelter. This probably started when one octopus piled up discarded shells after eating and these eventually stabilised enough of the sediment that another octopus could build its burrow inside. This new resident then created its own pile of discarded shells \u2013 until as many as 16 octopuses gathered on one spot, says Scheel, who has been studying the site with his colleagues.\nIn this \"octopus city\", individuals find themselves in a much more crowded situation than they are used to and exhibit curious behaviours to cope with others of their kind.\nMales sometimes try to coerce females into staying nearby and chase other males \u2013 occasionally crawling into each other's dens, wrestling with and evicting them. Sometimes when evicted males come back to their den, \"the evicting male may return and repeat the eviction\", Scheel says. And as they clean out their dens, the octopuses often push debris onto their neighbours' side. Sometimes, they hold the debris and use their funnels to blast it at one another, says Scheel, who documented some of these interactions in a 2022 paper.\nNeither aggressive nor cooperative, some scientists call these behaviours \"jostling\", says Scheel, who is still working out the purpose of these interactions. \"Here we've plopped a solitary animal into a complex social situation, and all they're doing is jostling, and they seem totally healthy. That suggests they're either less solitary than we thought, or the stresses of being [social] are not that severe [for them].\"\nThese sophisticated social interactions underscore the intelligence of solitary creatures. Similarly, researchers have seen some solitary reptiles closely watching other individuals and using that information to solve problems \u2013 an ability once thought to be unique to humans, says behavioural scientist Anna Wilkinson of the University of Lincoln in the UK. \"Animals who maybe wouldn't naturally form complex groups can actually have really quite sophisticated aspects of social learning,\" she says.\nIn experiments with red-footed tortoises, which forage by themselves but might encounter one another under fruiting trees, for example, Wilkinson presented them with a V-shaped, transparent fence with food on the inside. No animal could reach the food until Wilkinson and her colleagues trained one of them how to do it. Upon seeing their fellow reptile reach the food, the other tortoises immediately followed suit. It's especially remarkable to see that reptiles have the ability to learn from other individuals by imitation, considering that many of them have evolved to\u00a0hatch\u00a0from eggs without a parent around to teach them skills.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The linguist learning to speak 'cow'\n\u2022 The eerie ambassador from the abyss\n\u2022 Why some animals appear to mourn their dead\nEvidence like this is causing scientists to see solitary living not as a fixed, uniform category, but rather as a continuum: from animals like the (arguably) antisocial blind mole rat to species that live largely alone but learn from and cooperate with one another. Some species even blend solitary and more social lifestyles, like communally living striped mice that go solo once they start breeding, or raccoon-like coatis, whose males are solitary and females hunt in bands.\nStudying solitary animals and their social networks can help conservationists better protect and preserve their populations from human threats. Mayuka and Schradin have already started an effort to build a community of scientists to further decipher the lives, benefits, needs and challenges of solitary animals. \"Being solitary is not simple and primitive,\" Schradin says. \"It can be quite complex and provide challenges\u2026 which are solved in different ways by different species.\"\nUnderstanding the full breadth of solitary living could even be helpful for people. Kimchi is studying changes in the brains of blind mole rats as they switch between introverted and more social mating and pup-raising stages. Perhaps such research can help scientists understand how people with neurological or psychiatric conditions become socially withdrawn, she says.\u00a0\nBut solitary animals can also help us consider that being alone doesn't necessarily have to be problematic, even if it has been somewhat stigmatised in our extrovert-driven society, says Schradin. \"Social\" solitary animals construct meaningful social networks around them \u2013 and people living by themselves can, and do, too. \"Being alone,\" Schradin says, \"can also be the best choice for many humans.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\n\u00a0For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Nada Hafez competed for Egypt in the women's individual sabre fencing event at the Paris Olympics while seven months pregnant\n\"I was thinking about my baby, that I want my baby to be an Olympian.\" \nThat was the extra motivation that Egyptian fencer Nada Hafez needed when she took to the piste at Paris 2024.\nOnly a select few knew she was competing while seven months pregnant until she revealed the news on social media following her last-16 exit from her event. \nIt made headlines the world over.\nThe whirlwind reaction was like nothing Hafez had experienced before.\n\"I was just posting on my personal account - proud, saying I'm in the top 16 in the world while pregnant,\" Hafez told BBC Sport Africa. \n\"I didn't expect this would go viral. I didn't know what was going on.\"\nThe 27-year-old says the majority of responses to her message were positive.\n\"When the post went up, and I was an inspiration for everyone, this was a big thing for me.\"\nHafez, who is a clinical pathologist, says she had been given clearance from doctors to fence at the Games and wanted to show the world what a woman's body can do.\n\"This was a really important message for me - an Egyptian Arab woman - to tell all women that your body can surprise you,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes you need to see an example in front of you to know that you can do it. \n\"Because maybe a pregnant woman, she's afraid to do anything, and now she tells herself: 'There's a woman who competes at the Olympics while pregnant. So I can do whatever'.\"\nHafez upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky of the United States, in her first match at Paris 2024\nBut not everyone was so supportive of Hafez revealing that she fenced in the women's individual sabre at the Grand Palais while carrying a baby.\nA day later Hafez put out another Instagram post to emphasise she was not the first pregnant woman to appear at an Olympics and that she had wanted to \"shed light on the strength, perseverance and relentlessness\" of Egyptian women.\nThat strength came to the fore when dealing with negativity online.\n\"Some people don't want to see you succeed,\" she reflected.\n\"It's easy to put a comment and run. You don't face me.\n\"I wanted to clarify that I'm a doctor and this (competing while pregnant) is something that is not against any medical issues.\n\"Some people were saying I should have given the place to someone else. But this was not an option because I qualified.\n\"My mum told me 'Don't be sad if you read anything' - but I'm proud of what I did. I achieved something and it was very challenging.\"\nWith fencing being a combat sport using swords, could that have provoked the negative comments?\n\"For me, fencing is not as it looks - it has this sense of touch. My doctor assured me that it's not unsafe.\"\nHafez took up fencing aged 12 and has appeared at the past three editions of the Olympic Games\nCairo-based Hafez, who pursued her passion for fencing while studying for her medical degree, became an Egyptian sabre champion and went to both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games. \nSo, having qualified for Paris 2024, did she consider pulling out when she discovered she was pregnant? \n\"Yes, of course. I knew I was pregnant a week before a World Cup [event], and I said, 'Okay, I won't chance it because it's my first pregnancy',\" she explained.\n\"I didn't know how I would feel. \n\"I was waiting for my husband [a cardiothoracic surgeon] to tell me to stop and take rest. But he told me: 'We'll go to the doctor. Whatever he says, we'll do.'\n\"And the doctor said: 'You don't have a disease. You're just pregnant. If you're okay and everything is normal, you can do whatever you want.'\"\nWith that reassurance, Hafez felt ready to resume training. \nMindful of the spotlight falling on her nation if the news came out, she kept it as quiet as she could.\n\"I didn't have to tell anyone, because it's not against Olympic regulations,\" she said.\n\"I just told the people who needed to know. The most important thing was not to go against any laws or health conditions.\n\"I didn't know if I would make it so I took it step by step until I reached the Olympics.\"\nEgypt's National Olympic Committee told BBC Sport Africa it has no rules barring pregnant women from training or competing.\n\"But it has to be a safe environment and we have to make sure there is no risk involved,\" an official said.\nNada Hafez was full of emotion after she made it through to the last 16 of the Paris Games, her third Olympics having also competed at at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020\nNow a mum to four-month-old baby Zaina, Hafez can reflect on the part her daughter played in her achievements in Paris.\n\"I worked with my mental coach. I wanted to do something different for my baby,\" she said.\n\"I tried not to think that I have my excuse not to win. I thought differently: 'I'm pregnant and I will win', and I did it.\"\nHafez went on to upset the seventh seed, Elizabeth Tartakovsky, 15-13.\n\"It's one of the best results for female Egyptian Olympians,\" Hafez added.\n\"I was crying with happiness. This is something for my baby to be proud of.\"\nShe then lost 15-7 to Jeon Hayoung of South Korea in the last 16.\nNeither of her opponents knew Hafez was expecting. \n\"It's unfair if someone knows. Maybe they'd be afraid to put a touch or something, so no need to tell them.\"\nHafez, who is studying for a masters degree alongside being a new mum, is aiming to use her platform to stand up for women's rights in sport.\nShe has not yet decided whether she wants to try and qualify for Los Angeles 2028.\nFor now, she is still processing what she achieved in Paris.\n\"Young girls told me, 'You've inspired us so much. We want to go to medical school and continue in sports',\" she said.\n\"And that made me happiest.\n\"Whenever I get a message from anyone telling me I'm a role model it sets my heart on fire - because that's what I'm working on for my whole life.\n\"I'm still young. I'm aiming to do more and be a good example as a mum.\n\"I hope my daughter will be an Olympian one day. She's a baby Olympian - and maybe she'll be an adult Olympian.\"",

        "article_text": "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.\nCheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.\nNow, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.\n\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.\n\"That's what we want.\"\nMr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.\nProductions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.\nThe loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.\nBefore the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.\n\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"\nHollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.\nMany say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA. \nBut studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.\nStudios are, however, very responsive to A-list actors.\nMegastar Vin Diesel helped ensure Universal Pictures would finish filming the latest Fast and Furious movie in Los Angeles.\n\"LA really, really, really needs production to help rebuild,\" Diesel said in an Instagram post.\n\"Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago\u2026 and now Fast will finally return home.\"\nNearly 20,000 people \u2013 including actors Keanu Reeves, Zooey Deschanel and Kevin Bacon \u2013 have signed a \"Stay in LA\" petition urging the state's leaders to temporarily remove caps on production tax incentives for LA County.\nIt's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.\n\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.\nBefore the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.\nHe says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.\nIf passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.\nPresident Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".\nIt's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.\nOn a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.\n\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.\nAlthough he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.\nMs Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.\n\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"\nOthers think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.\nPointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.\nHis once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.\n\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.\nAbout a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.\nShe laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.\n\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.\nMs Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.\n\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"\nDoes she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?\n\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\"",

        "article_text": "Jack Catterall outpointed former world champion Regis Prograis in February\nJack Catterall v Arnold Barboza Jr\nVenue: Co-op Live, Manchester Date: Saturday, 15 February\nBBC Coverage: Follow radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds from 21:00 GMT on Saturday on the BBC Sport website and app\nJack Catterall is the best active fighter in Britain who has not won a world title, and it would be a massive injustice if he never does.\nHe has shown he is good enough and can be dominant at the top level. When he is good, he is brilliant.\nAt 31, he is still young and fresh enough to reach that goal. But with every passing month and year, you become slower, older and more jaded.\nIt is not just about the hard fights, but the training and mental stimulation. The politics and things out of the ring suck away at you, take their toll and take away your aspirations.\nCatterall - who faces Arnold Barboza Jr in Manchester on Saturday - should have become undisputed light-welterweight champion in 2022 against Josh Taylor.\nEven though Taylor is one of my favourite fighters in recent memory, the 'Tartan Tornado' lost that fight, despite the judges scoring it otherwise.\nIf Catterall is a glass half-empty type of guy, maybe even winning one belt now will not be enough - he will probably never get the chance to become an undisputed champion.\nI was not always convinced Catterall would reach the heights of boxing. I was unsure about his drive and desire, and that uncertainty was because of his personality.\nHe is charismatic and a good-looking kid, but he is not an outrageous headline grabber and would not really put himself out there.\nHe reminded me a little bit of Joe Calzaghe, who was reluctant to do any sponsorship events unless he knew somebody there. In fact, I once got a sponsored car from Joe not going to places and me going instead.\nBut Catterall has proved me wrong and my assessment may have been a little bit disrespectful. Just because he is a nice guy does not mean he is not tough. He has shown he is one of the toughest fighters out there and is willing to go to war.\nIn his performances in the two fights with Taylor, for example, he boxed like his normal self but with more ambition. \nWhen he outpointed Regis Prograis in October, Catterall put his foot on the gas when he had the opportunity in a mature, experienced and skilled performance.\nThe problem is that because Catterall is such a thinking fighter, he can sometimes be overcautious and let himself down.\nAs a coach, you have to be happy because he does not take unnecessary risks, but sometimes as a fan you want more.\nI was a safety-first fighter, so I understand that, but it holds you back from stoppages and people taking notice of you.\nArnold Barboza Jr has won all 31 of his professional fights\nBarboza Jr is a good fighter and if he gets an opportunity to slow you down then he could be a hard night's work, but I think Catterall's movement, jab and patience will frustrate him.\nWBO champion Teofimo Lopez has been ordered to fight the winner - who will be the governing body's 'interim' champion - within 180 days. If Lopez decides to move up the divisions, either Catterall or Barboza could then be upgraded to replace him.\nNobody would begrudge Catterall if he was elevated to world champion, but it is ludicrous and stupid. It spoils it for the fighters, who dream of hearing the words \"and the new\".\nEither just make this a final eliminator or make it for the vacant title and strip Lopez if he does not plan to stay in the division.\nHowever, I do believe Catterall will become a world champion one way or another. The WBC champion Albert Puella is a good but beatable fighter and Catterall would fancy his chances. As he would against Jose Valenzuela, who holds the WBA belt.\nWhen you get to my age and reflect on your career, you look at whether you ticked every box. To be financially secure and to win a world title are the two main boxes.\nI won a world title in 1997 - back when I had hair - but even now when I go back home, people still shout out \"hi champ\". Without the world title I would just be Barry Jones who used to box.\nCatterall will always feel his career is unfulfilled until he has that world title around his waist, because being a world champion stays with you forever.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country.\nThe properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board.\nThe new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion.\nOn 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders.\nThey claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation.\nThe new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.\nBut several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.\nA vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.\nThe tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.\nThe properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.\nThe government says that the waqf boards are among India\u2019s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).\nMuslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. \nBut critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies \u2013 which too requires immediate attention.\nA report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. \nThe committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.\nThe committee also noted that \u201cencroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common\u201d, listing hundreds of instances of such \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d of waqf land by government authorities.\nAccording to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.\nThe amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.\nParliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.\nBut many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.\nMany of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.\nThe 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.\nProfessor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.\n\u201cYou can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,\u201d Prof Rehman says.\nOthers worry that the new bill may not address the community\u2019s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.\nThat's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. \nSome agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. \nBut the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. \u201cThere seems to be an attempt not only to get the state\u2019s control over Muslims\u2019 properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community\u2019s lives.\u201d\nAmong other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf\u2019s claim to a property is valid.\nCritics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.\nThe current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.\nBut some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. \n\"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,\u201d Owaisi recently told reporters.\nThis process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.\n\u201cThe diagnosis may be correct,\u201d Prof Rehman says, \u201cbut the treatment is not.\u201d",

        "article_text": "\"I have no plans for the future at all,\" says Oleksandr Bezhan, standing next to an empty, frozen paddock where he used to work as a fisherman on the bank of the Dnipro river in southern Ukraine. \"If I wake up in the morning, that's already pretty good.\"\nMalokaterynivka sits just 15km (9 miles) north of the front line in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region.\nIf US President Donald Trump succeeds in halting the war, Malokaterynivka is hoping to end up on the right side of that front line.\nI last visited this area in 2023, when Ukraine launched a much-anticipated counter-offensive.\nAt the time, Ukrainians dared to dream of winning this war. They had, after all, won the battle of Kyiv and liberated swathes of territory elsewhere.\nBut 18 months on, thunder-like artillery exchanges reflect the failure of that operation, and Russia's dominance.\nThe front line here is broadly in the same place - but the broad expanse of river has gone.\nWhen the Russian-occupied Kakhovka dam downstream was destroyed, this became a vast, uninterrupted expanse of scrubland.\nThe barren surroundings reflect the frozen limbo in which Ukraine finds itself. The White House wants to end the war, but it's not as simple as blowing a full-time whistle.\n\"If the front line becomes a border, it would be scary\u2026 fighting could break out at any moment,\" explains Oleksandr.\nThe exposed riverbed separates our location from Russian-occupied territory. Distant sunlight bounces off the metallic Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in Moscow's grip since 2022.\nUkraine and the US both want peace, but that is where the consensus seems to end.\nWashington's vision of it, along with battlefield realities, means Russia will probably keep hold of the Ukrainian land it's seized.\nUkraine wants meaningful security guarantees that would prevent invading forces from pushing across the river.\nInstead, Trump has denied Kyiv's dream of joining the Nato alliance as he focuses on Russia.\nHaving watched and reported on Ukraine's fight for more than three years, it is an especially tough hand for the country to receive.\nThere are feelings of betrayal. Commentators criticise either Ukrainian President Zelensky or the new foreign policy of its biggest ally.\n\"The border wouldn't depend on us,\" says Oleksandr. \"It probably won't work out, but Seoul is 30km from North Korea, and they somehow live and prosper.\"\nMalokaterynivka's challenge of finding a new purpose lies at the heart of Ukraine's future.\nAnd while politicians talk about talks, Ukrainians continue to fight and die.\nVillagers gather for the funeral of a local soldier, also named Oleksandr.

        "article_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas. \nModi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\nWhile both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\". \nThe Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US. \nAt a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.\n\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".\nTrump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries. \n\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.\nWith India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC. \n\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said. \nHowever, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said. \n\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit. \nTrump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets. \nThe two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".\nModi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US. \nLast week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday. \n Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\nShortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.\nHe acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".\nTrump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.\n\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"\nThe White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.\nThe document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.\n\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said. \n\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"\nTrump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic. \nHe has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. \nEarlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs.",

        "article_text": "Newcastle have never won a Premier League game at Etihad Stadium, with their best results being two draws from 20 visits, but will they finally get the better of Manchester City there on Saturday?\n\"I usually use science to help me make my predictions, but this time I have to think about history too,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"There are always certain grounds where, for whatever reason, some clubs cannot get over the line - but you also have to consider that these long runs without a win have to end some time.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 25, he takes on The Wombats drummer Dan Haggis, who is an Everton fan.\nThe Wombats' new album, Oh! The Ocean, is out on Friday and the band start a six-date UK arena tour in March. They also headline the opening night of the On The Waterfront festival in their home city of Liverpool in June.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nHaggis backed Everton to \"get something\" out of Wednesday's Merseyside derby\nHaggis has already made one prediction this week - he thought Everton would beat Liverpool in Wednesday's dramatic Merseyside derby - and feels there are lots of reasons for Toffees fans to be cheerful at the moment.\n\"You've got to be optimistic as an Everton fan, really,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Otherwise you can just get too anxious and drown in the worry of relegation battles - well, in the past few years anyway.\n\"To be fair, I did like Sean Dyche, and thought that, with what he had, he built a pretty solid unit where everyone knew their job.\n\"But obviously we couldn't really score goals, which was frustrating and boring to watch in a way - all fans want to see goals, because they are the moments of elation we all look forward to.\n\"It's very rare you are pumping the air after a 0-0 draw unless it's a hard-fought battle against Manchester City, or someone like that.  To do it in those games is fine, but not every week.\n\"David Moyes has come in and has obviously been left a good foundation by Dyche. It's like he has thought he has inherited a team who are very well organised, but we can build on it.\n\"Things have definitely picked up in the past few weeks, and we have started scoring goals too,  so I feel really positive.\"\nOh! The Ocean is The Wombats' sixth album. Their fifth, Fix Yourself, Not the World, reached number one in 2022\nThis is Everton's final season at Goodison Park before they move to their new stadium, something Haggis has mixed feelings about.\n\"I was a season ticket holder for a few years until I was 18, from about 1992 to 1998,\" he explained.\n\"Then Saturdays kind of got taken over by music, but I grew up going to Goodison so of course I will miss it.\n\"It is bitter-sweet, really, because the atmosphere in there when it is good is just unbelievable - I have never experienced anything like it anywhere else.\n\"Plus I have so many memories attached to the place, from going with my dad and brother, and my friends, and all the rest of it.\n\"But the new stadium looks amazing and as well as being brilliant for the club, it is going to be great for the city too, especially that part of it.\n\"Suddenly we are going to have a world-class stadium right on the riverfront, which will be amazing for lots of events, including music - hopefully The Wombats will get to support Paul McCartney there one day soon!\"\nChris Sutton and Dan Haggis were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nBrighton 3-0 Chelsea\nBrighton came out on top when these two sides met in the FA Cup last weekend, and Chelsea did not offer much in attack after taking an early lead.\nEnzo Maresca's side just seem to be going through a flat period at the moment. They are still fourth in the table, but their performances have definitely dipped. \nThe Seagulls' results have been very up and down too, and it's hard to pick a winner - so I am going to go with a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nDan's prediction: Chelsea are going to have something to prove after losing in the FA Cup and I actually think they are going to dominate this. 1-3\nKing Power Stadium, 12:30 GMT\nIt seems Kai Havertz has turned into Pele in the eyes of Arsenal fans since he has been sidelined by a hamstring injury.\nAll of a sudden Havertz is a world-beater, that they cannot cope without, when in reality he has been panned by them for his inconsistent finishing since he joined.\nBut, with Gabriel Jesus already out injured for the season, Havertz's absence will give Arsenal fans an excuse if they end up not winning anything this campaign, and there will be a pile-on to ask why they did not sign another striker.\nThe fact Gunners boss Mikel Arteta tried to get Ollie Watkins from Aston Villa in January tells you that he wanted someone in.\nNow, if they don't win the league, there will be this blame game. Is it Arteta's fault, or is it on the board for not backing him? \nStill, even with Havertz out, and Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli both injured too, I think Arsenal will have enough to beat Leicester. Leandro Trossard will probably lead their attack, although Raheem Sterling can also play up there.\nLeicester are out of the FA Cup and were walloped by Everton in their last Premier League game. This is not going to be anything like as close as their last meeting, in September.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nDan's prediction: I have a soft spot for Arsenal because my uncle supported them and he passed away. When I see them play I think of him and hope they win, unless they are playing Everton of course. 0-2\nVilla Park, 15:00 GMT\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna made 11 changes for their FA Cup tie against Coventry, so what does he do here to try to stop his side's four-game losing run in the league?\nLast time the Tractor Boys were in the Midlands, they demolished the Sky Blues, but this is obviously a much tougher test.\nAston Villa also got through in the FA Cup, beating Tottenham, but they have gone three games without a win in the league - drawing with Arsenal and West Ham, and losing to Wolves.\nAll three of those results came after midweek matches, however, and not being in the Champions League play-off round this week is a big boost for Villa.\nUnai Emery's side are short of centre-backs, with Ezri Konsa the latest to be injured when he was forced off against Spurs, but they do have new loan signing Axel Disasi to come into their defence.\nI think Ipswich will score, but Villa are going to score more.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nDan's prediction: With any luck going to Villa will give Marcus Rashford a new lease of life. I see them winning this comfortably. 3-1\nCraven Cottage, 15:00 GMT\nFor the first couple of months of the season I was talking about how good Fulham are at home - I obviously put the mockers on them because they have not won any of their past five league matches at Craven Cottage.\nNottingham Forest, who needed penalties to get past Exeter in the FA Cup on Tuesday, have got an excellent away record and Liverpool are the only top-flight team to have picked up more points than them on the road this season.\nThis is hard to call, though, because we know Fulham can turn it on, and they are a hard team to predict. \nThey won at the City Ground earlier in the season but this time I am going with my club, Forest, to get a point and continue their push for the top four.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nDan's prediction: I am amazed by how well Forest are doing, and they are good to watch too. They used to be one of those teams I used to skip on Match of the Day because they were boring, but not anymore! 1-2\nEtihad Stadium, 15:00 GMT\nI am at this game for BBC Radio 5 live and there is no way City are keeping a clean sheet.\nIn fact, until I realised just how bad Newcastle's record is at the Etihad, I was thinking of backing Eddie Howe's side to win.\nCity have won the past 10 league games between the two sides here, and my old Blackburn strike partner Alan Shearer got the winner the last time Newcastle took the points at City - in September 2000 at their old Maine Road ground.\nThat all points to a City win for me, far more than their current form does anyway.\nLet's face it, form does not really help me much anyway at the moment. Who could have seen Newcastle losing at home to Fulham in their last league game?\nSo I may as well say a hoodoo like this one will continue and City will get over the line, even if Newcastle do definitely have a goal or two in them.\nI don't think it will make much difference who City start in goal, because Ederson and Stefan Ortega have both made mistakes this season, but it is going to be interesting to see who Pep Guardiola picks with the second leg of their Champions League tie with Real Madrid coming up next week. \nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nDan's prediction: This is a tough one to call but City are at home so I am going with them to win. I feel like there will be a few goals because I reckon both teams will just go for it but the chances are it won't be as exciting as I think. 4-2\nSt Mary's Stadium, 15:00 GMT\nI'd be shocked if Bournemouth don't win this.\nEven in the FA Cup against Burnley, Southampton could not give their home fans anything to cheer about. Dear me, what a depressing season this has been for them. \nSaints would be better off finishing the campaign now - just packing up, shutting the ground down and looking forward to next season, or looking ahead to it, anyway - why would you be looking forward to it after such a dismal few months?\nBournemouth are well organised, have a good balance to their team and Justin Kluivert is on fire. They have quite a few injuries but you don't hear them complain do you? They just get on with it.\nSutton's prediction: 1-3\nDan's prediction: Bournemouth looked really good against us. 1-2\nLondon Stadium, 15:00 GMT\nBrentford are not great away from home, while West Ham need to get something after taking only one point from their past three matches.\nThis has got a draw written all over it, really, but I am not going to take the easy option and go for 1-1 here like my guest has done. That would be boring!\nAlthough Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa are always so dangerous for the Bees, I am going to go with West Ham to win it.\nNew Hammers boss Graham Potter has taken over a difficult situation and he is finding it hard to get results - he has only won one of his five games in charge so far.\nTheir struggles are not on him though, and it would definitely boost their chances if he has Jarrod Bowen back from injury soon - he has been training this week.\nBowen scored a hat-trick when West Ham beat Brentford 4-2 in February last year. There won't be as many goals this time, but I am going for the same outcome.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nDan's prediction: I really like Brentford as a club. There is just something about them that is very likable, and they have been great since they came up to the Premier League. As a team they never lie down and, the way their fans are, they don't seen to get down on the players if they lose, they just support them through and through. West Ham have not had much of a new manager bounce under Potter but I have not gone for a draw yet so let's go for one here. 1-1\nSelhurst Park, 17:30 GMT\nWhat a job David Moyes has done since returning to Everton last month.\nHis side gave us such great drama at the end of the Merseyside derby, although I must admit I was not watching it properly because I was covering Celtic in the Champions League for Match of the Day.\nMoyes has really got Everton going again but I think he is in for a tough evening here.\nYou have to wonder how much Wednesday night will have taken out of the Toffees, and I suspect it was quite a lot.\nCrystal Palace are going well at the moment, and Jean-Philippe Mateta will be hard to stop. \nThe Eagles been steadily climbing the table for a few weeks now and I am expecting that to continue, although it will be close.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nDan's prediction: I am just glad this is a mid-table match, rather than the relegation six-pointer it might have been a couple of months ago. I have got to go for an Everton win obviously, but given the defensive mistakes we made against Bournemouth I don't think we will keep a clean sheet. 1-2\nAnfield, 14:00 GMT\nWolves got a big win over Villa in their last league match and I watched them beat Blackburn in the FA Cup too.\nI cannot see Vitor Pereira's side getting anything at Anfield, though.\nLiverpool have to bounce back after conceding an equaliser so late on against Everton but I do expect them to react positively here.\nThey might not have manager Arne Slot or his assistant Sipke Hulshoff on the bench after their red cards on Wednesday, and this is a tricky spell for them with away games against Aston Villa and Manchester City coming up next week.\nA lot of people might be thinking this might be their blip, but I don't think what happened in the derby is going to faze Liverpool.\nThere are 14 games left so they are not in the home straight yet, and they still have a seven-point cushion at the top.\nIn many ways, their players might use the dropped points at Goodison Park as a motivation to see off Wolves, and I am pretty confident they will get back on track straight away.\nI am going for Mohammed Salah to score and Liverpool to win comfortably.\nSutton's prediction: 3-0\nDan's prediction: Liverpool are going to batter Wolves - they will be seething after what happened against us on Wednesday. 3-0\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 16:30 GMT\nTrying to call this is a bit like a game I used to play with my kids, poker dice, where you roll five dice and it is completely random what you end up with.\nThis is the first time I have so little idea of what to expect from both sides that I actually think I need to make two predictions, rather than one.\nI can guarantee you this, though. Whatever result I go for, it will end up being the opposite of what actually happens.\nTottenham demolished Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford in September but that does not really have any bearing here.\nSpurs are getting players back from injury and Timo Werner, James Maddison and Guglielmo Vicario are among those training again, but how fit are they going to be for this game?\nAnge Postecoglou says his players are out on their feet and we could see that in their FA Cup defeat at Aston Villa, so a lot depends on how  much they have left in the tank.\nAs for Manchester United, well I've been reading reports this week that some of their players are unhappy with Ruben Amorim's style of play.\nThere is lots going on off the pitch too, with stories that more redundancies are planned at the club, following controversy over a rise in ticket prices., external\nWho would have thought when Ineos completed their deal to take a stake in United 12 months ago that, within a year, they could possibly be as unpopular with fans as  co-owners the Glazers are.\nIn regards to Amorim, I just think he needs time. He arrived in mid-season, he has his way of playing and United will have to give him the players who fit that system, so it might take a window or two before we see him with the team he wants.\nThere needs to be patience there, but we also know football fans are impatient. They want to see some improvement in the short-term, and it is hard to argue they have made any progress since Amorim took charge.\nI still have a sneaky feeling they might edge this game but I cannot really tell you what I am basing that on.\nThis is a big game for Ange too, now his side are out of both domestic cups, but I am going with United, just.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 or 4-0 [only 1-2 will count as Chris's score]\nDan's prediction: These two are both having a shocker - it looks like the league table is upside down when you see them down in 13th and 14th, and hopefully we will be above both of them by the time this game is played. They both need a win pretty badly, so I can see this being a draw. 2-2\nChris picked the winner in 11 of last week's 16 FA Cup fourth-round ties.\nHis guests, indie-rock band Doves, were right about nine of the ties.\nThe BBC readers also got 11 predictions correct, but again Plymouth caught pretty much everyone out.\nIn round three, out of more than 38,000 predictions, only 4% of you went with Argyle to beat Brentford.\nThis time, from about 40,000 predictions for their tie against Liverpool, just 7% of you picked the Pilgrims to progress. \nWill more of you back Plymouth against Manchester City in round five?\nWednesday's Premier League game between Everton and Liverpool was originally scheduled for week 15 but was postponed because of Storm Darragh.\nThe BBC readers led that week with just that game to go, on 100 points ahead of Chris and his guest - Travis bassist Dougie Payne - who were both on 70 points.\nDougie and the BBC readers both went for a 3-1 Liverpool victory, and were both wrong.\nChris went with 1-1, giving him 10 extra points, but he needed an exact score from the 2-2 draw to take the weekly win off the BBC readers.",

        "article_text": "The new star of US fashion Christopher John Rogers' bold designs are worn by the likes of Zendaya and Gigi Hadid. Backstage at his New York Fashion Week show, he talks style, hierarchies \u2013 and clothes as a \"tool for hope\".\nConnecting the dots between New York fashion's past and future might start with some actual dots. They are the size of a bottle bottom and the colour of Skittles sweets \u2013 orange, lime, cherry, grape \u2013 and hug the edges of jackets, dresses and corsets. Anne Hathaway has worn the dots. Zendaya has worn the dots. Gigi Hadid has worn the dots. At the 2024 Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, the dots were beamed into the homes of 23.6 million Americans, sported by the theatre star Cole Escola as they rode a giant flamingo float through Times Square.\nThe can't-miss-it motif was designed by 32-year-old Christopher John Rogers, a US fashion designer who counts style icon Diane von Furstenberg as a mentor, and Louisiana as his home state. A graduate of Savannah College of Art and Design, Rogers is fast becoming a new figurehead of US style, thanks to his unique embrace of colour combined with a strong command of tailored, built-to-last elegance.\nBy making Italian wool trousers in a shimmering rose gold, and cocktail frocks in a bold cartoon red, Rogers and his longtime business partner Christina Ripley are staging a silk-and-merino assault on \"quiet luxury\", the de-facto fashion uniform of muted beige cashmere coats and boxy anonymous black handbags made popular by the fictional titans on TV's Succession and by edgy, understated New York labels like The Row and Khaite.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"I'm trying to flatten some hierarchies with my designs,\" says Rogers backstage at his New York Fashion Week show. Vogue's longtimeleader Anna Wintour and the actress Keke Palmer sit front row \u2013 a sign of their commitment to the designer, considering the show was held in a former fish factory in Brooklyn's industrial, and remote, Navy Yard. \"How can we help more people feel like they belong, but also like it's okay to stand out? American fashion right now is in a state of flux,\" the designer tells the BBC. \"We want newness; we want transformation. But we have to be willing to try some fresh approaches. We have to make people excited to get dressed again, to use clothes as a tool for hope\u2026 Even if you're just wearing them to go down the street for coffee.\"\u00a0\nRogers's bold but precise jackets and dresses have made the designer a standout seller at agenda-setting boutiques and platforms like Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Net-a-Porter. They have also made the rising fashion star something of an anomaly: along with contemporaries like Sergio Hudson and Brother Vellies' Aurora James, Rogers is one of just a handful of black US fashion designers sold at major luxury retailers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"In a way, I hate that I have to talk about it,\" Rogers says. \"I mean, I'm honoured to have the responsibility and opportunity of being a black designer right now. But the fact that we, as an industry, are still dealing with that lack of representation is tough sometimes. For me personally, it means that I feel this pressure to be 'perfect'. But I'm human! I'm not perfect! And I'm on a journey right now of figuring out where pressure ends and excitement begins.\" To explore that tension, Rogers calls his new collection \"Exhale\", and doubles down on his ethos of jolting black party frocks and brown Wall Street suiting with pops of lilac, rosemary green and flamingo pink. \"Some people are never gonna get it,\" Rogers shrugs. \"But the stores, and certainly the fans, are seeing that a lot of people are.\"\u00a0\nRogers's success began seven years ago, when the designer released his first eponymous collection from a tiny Chinatown studio in Manhattan. At first, he waited tables to afford the luxury fabric needed for his 25 looks, but he was quickly hired by the US designer Rosie Assoulin, then by British designer Jonathan Saunders and Von Furstenberg herself. \"I really credit my success with extremely hard work, like insanely hard work,\" he laughs. \"But also, I truly believe that being a nice person and a kind person is the only way to work in fashion. Taking the ego out of it and realising that teamwork is the only way to go, that's why we're winning right now.\"\u00a0\nHe means that literally. In 2019, Rogers won the prestigious CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund Award, which infused his nascent label with $400,000; in 2021, he beat established industry icons like Marc Jacobs and Gabriela Hearst to the CFDA's Womenswear Designer of the Year award, and nabbed a prestigious LVMH Prize nomination from the luxury conglomerate in Paris, too.\nBut industry accolades are only half the fashion puzzle: getting people to buy your stuff is the real goal. On that front, Rogers is making brisk business, too, thanks to his understanding of hybrid-office style norms. During the height of the pandemic, Rogers's candy-coloured knitwear and spangled sweater dresses became pose-from-home favourites for stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Rihanna. Last October, he did his first collaboration with J Crew, including 40 pieces for adults and eight for children. In both his main collection and his high street range, he offers extended sizing to include as many potential shoppers as he can.\nThe Changing Room\nThe Changing Room\u00a0is a column from the BBC that spotlights the fashion and style innovators on the frontlines of a progressive evolution.\n\"Everyone wants an exciting dress that's actually built to fit their body,\" says Nikki Ogunnaike, the editor-in-chief of Marie Claire who has featured Rogers's designs in the magazine, as well as her shopping newsletter Self Checkout. Ogunnaike says Rogers's \"surprising\" success is actually a nod to American shoppers who don't live in New York or Los Angeles, where US fashion generally plays most of its gambits. \"We haven't really had a black American fashion designer who comes from the American South, and who uses that culture to shape his point of view in such a strong, joyful, accessible way,\" she tells the BBC. Rogers's most obvious reinterpretation of a Southern American motif \u2013 a plaid fuchsia dress with a bell-shaped silhouette that looks like a reclaimed, re-trained hoop skirt \u2013 is now part of the permanent collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\"What he's doing with the strong, vibrant, almost defiant colours and the more formal, dressed-up silhouettes is really important from a cultural perspective,\" says Ogunnaike. \"But that only matters because we actually want to wear the clothes. They're so fun. So many people look great in them, and wear them in their own way. He wants you to have a great time in your life. He gets it!\"\nKeke Palmer, the actress who sat on the front row at Rogers's catwalk show in a white peplum gown and blue feathered coat by the designer, agrees. \"It's glamorous!\" she exclaims of her red carpet look as flashbulbs popped off around her. \"And current. He's now.\"\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Today, the annual Berlinale begins, as the German city hosts 10 days of film and TV premieres from around the globe, complete with appearances from big-time directors and A-list stars. Here's what to look out for.\nIt may be freezing in Berlin right now, but culturally, the temperature is about to rise as its annual film festival kicks off today. Alongside those in Cannes and Venice, the Berlinale is one of Europe's great trio of film festivals \u2013 and is known for mixing bold provocative programming with big names, as well as being a place where future awards winners can be first spotted. Here's six ways this year's event is likely to make a big impression.\nCould Chalamet becomes the youngest ever winner of the best actor Academy Award for his skilled impersonation of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown? It's certainly looking increasingly likely, as in recent weeks he has narrowed the gap with long-standing category favourite Adrien Brody (incidentally, the current holder of the youngest winner accolade, for 2002's The Pianist) to the point where they are almost neck-and-neck in the odds. And that may in part be to his especially endearing campaigning, which has included everything from Saturday Night Live appearances to turning up at the film's London premiere on one of the city's distinctively neon green rental Lime bikes. Now he's set to land in Berlin for A Complete Unknown's Berlinale special gala, which will mark its German debut, and the question is: which quirky and headline-grabbing gesture might he deploy next? Eating a currywurst on the red carpet, perhaps?\nRichard Linklater and Ethan Hawke have collaborated on some of US cinema's most stunningly insightful and humane films \u2013 the Before trilogy and Boyhood included \u2013 so the director and actor should make beautiful music together again in Blue Moon, which premieres at the festival next Tuesday. Like Before Sunset, it's a real-time film, unfolding over 100 minutes in 1943, on the opening night of Rodgers and Hammerstein's first Broadway smash, Oklahoma!. At the party after the show, its composer, Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott), soaks up the acclaim alongside friends and admirers. But where does that leave Lorenz Hart (Hawke), who was Rodgers' lyricist and creative partner for 20 years before Oscar Hammerstein took over? The one-time toast of Broadway is now ground down by alcoholism and depression, with only the company of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (Margaret Qualley) and a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) to keep him going. Is it too early to start talking about 2026's Oscars? Probably, but considering the level of talent involved, and considering that the Academy loves true stories of American entertainment legends, Blue Moon could well be in the mix.\nIt's been five years this month since the South Korean director changed the face of cinema history, when his scabrous class satire Parasite became the first ever film not in the English language to win the top prize at the Oscars. And now, finally, his much-anticipated follow-up Mickey 17 is getting its world premiere at Berlin this weekend, following delays; it was originally scheduled to be released in March 2024. What that may say about the quality of the film or not, we will have to see, but the trailer certainly suggests it will be a sci-fi like few others: starring the ever-creatively risk-taking Robert Pattinson, and adapted from a 2022 novel by relatively little known author Edward Ashton, it will tell the story of a man who repeatedly dies, and is then cloned again, as he works as an \"expendable\" on a space mission \u2013 only for the regeneration process to go wrong and send things haywire. The excellent supporting cast includes Toni Collette, Naomi Ackie, Steven Yeun and Mark Ruffalo, while the whole tone of the trailer suggests a particularly wacky treatise on some of Bong's favoured themes, namely capitalism and exploitation.\nIncreasingly, the top film festivals have made space for premieres of splashy TV shows too \u2013 this year's Berlinale will be screening the first two episodes of one of the year's most anticipated drama miniseries, The Narrow Road to the Deep North. Adapted from the Booker prize-winning novel by Australian author Richard Flanagan, it stars Saltburn and Euphoria heartthrob Jacob Elordi as Dorrigo Evans, an Australian World War Two soldier who becomes interred in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Tracing his traumatic experiences there being forced to help build Burma's notorious \"Death\" Railway, as well as his subsequent return to his home country, it will undoubtedly be an intense viewing experience. Promisingly, too, it's directed by Justin Kurzel, who with films like True History of the Kelly Gang and The Order, has established himself as a superb deconstructor of masculinity and male violence. The show is set to premiere on the BBC in the UK soon, and Amazon Prime Video in Australia, New Zealand and Canada on 18 April, with a US release date yet to be confirmed. But with the talent involved, you can rest assured it will find its way there soon enough too.\nBeware: when If I Had Legs I'd Kick You premiered at the Sundance Festival in January, it was hailed as the most stressful viewing experience since Uncut Gems. Rose Byrne stars as an overworked therapist who is looking after her sick daughter while her husband is away \u2013 and as she is faced with problem after problem, viewers may reach the panic levels usually associated with a slasher movie. Mary Bronstein's frantic comedy drama isn't the only film in Berlin to be propelled by the crushing pressures of ill health and motherhood, either. In Mother's Baby, a German drama written and directed by Johanna Moder, a new mother (Marie Leuenberger) feels so alienated from her poorly infant that she suspects that a doctor (Claes Bang) has given her someone else's offspring instead. And in Rebecca Lenkiewicz's Hot Milk, adapted from Deborah Levy's Booker prize-nominated novel, the relationship between a controlling mother (Fiona Shaw) and her grown-up daughter (Emma Mackey) fractures when they travel to Spain to find a cure for the mother's debilitating illness.\nBerlin is a festival that specialises in powerfully political dramas and documentaries. Last year, two of the big winners were Dahomey, a non-fiction work about the repatriation of colonial artefacts, which picked up the Golden Bear for best film, and No Other Land, a documentary exploring the situation in the West Bank, which earned an audience award in the Panorama section for edgier, more experimental material. This year, that tradition looks set to continue right from the opening night film The Light, written and directed by Tom Tykwer, in which a German family is shaken by the arrival of a Syrian refugee. Elsewhere Gabriel Mascaro's The Blue Trail imagines a near-future in which the Brazilian government forces citizens in their mid-70s to move away to their own remote communities. And most intriguingly of all, Michel Franco's Dreams stars Jessica Chastain as a wealthy San Francisco socialite having a passionate romance with a ballet dancer (Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez) who has crossed the border illegally from Mexico. This torrid older-woman-younger-man drama could be this year's Babygirl, but it's not just the differences in age and status that cause trouble in Dreams, but the imbalance in the lovers' rights to live and work in the US. If you've seen Franco's 2020 thriller, New Order, you'll know that when the underprivileged meet the overprivileged in his films, the results can be shocking.\nThe Berlin Film Festival runs from 13 to 23 February.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "From raw eggs to protein shakes, those hoping to expand their brawn are often encouraged to ingest vast quantities of protein. But how much is really necessary and what's the best way to consume it?\nSophia\u00a0Moulson, 21, a fitness influencer based in West Sussex, began taking fitness seriously at the age of 19, after struggling with being overweight.\n\"I often turned to food as a source of comfort, which ultimately left me in a cycle of negative self-image and low confidence. One day, I realised that I needed to take control \u2013 not just for my physical health but for my mental wellbeing too,\" says Moulson.\nInitially, she joined the gym with the sole intention of losing weight. But over time, she fell in love with the process of building up a healthy amount of muscle too. \"I discovered how empowering it felt to grow stronger, and each small strength milestone motivated me to keep pushing forward,\" she says.\nAn integral part of Moulson's progress was research on nutrition. That's when she learned about the importance of protein for building muscle. However, as a vegetarian, Moulson initially felt that she was struggling to get enough protein through just her diet, so she turned to protein powders. \"While it was possible for me to meet my needs through a well-balanced diet, it often required time and careful planning. Protein powders offered a convenient solution, especially with my busy lifestyle,\" she says.\nWhile in the past, bodybuilders were notorious for consuming vast quantities of steak and drinking raw eggs, today, protein powders and tailored diets are big business. But do we really need so much protein to grow stronger? And what is the best way to consume it?\nLinea Patel, a\u00a0Sports Dietitian at the company Pure Sports Medicine in London, explains that proteins have many roles in the human body. As they are digested, the proteins in food are broken down into amino acids \u2013 building blocks that can be rearranged to form any protein that the body needs. Haemoglobin, enzymes, muscles, the keratin in our skin and hair \u2013 there are more than 20,000 proteins in the human body, performing a wide range of functions.\nHowever, the amount that each person needs can vary greatly, depending on their age, body composition and lifestyle.\n\"In the UK, the government guidelines say that the general baseline for sedentary adults is that they should consume 0.8 or 0.75g\u00a0[around 0.03oz] of protein per kg of their own body weight,\" says Patel. \"So, for example, if somebody weighed 70kg [154lb], then you just multiply that by 0.8 and you'll get 56g [around 2oz] of protein a day.\"\nMost people get more than that amount from their normal diets. In the US, the average American consumes around 14-16% of their total calories as protein. However, if you're more active, your protein requirements may exceed 1g per kg each day. The amount of protein you need also depends on factors such as your age, because people tend to lose muscle mass as they get older \u2013 consuming more protein can help us to hold onto more muscle. Post-menopausal women also have higher protein requirements.\n\"What I see in my clinical practice, particularly because I work with women in the menopause or high performing individuals [sportspeople], is that perhaps that they're not eating enough protein for their level of activity or to maintain [appropriate] muscle mass for their stage of life,\" says Patel. One size doesn't fit all, she explains.\nFor individuals engaging in regular high-intensity resistance training or athletes and powerlifters or body builders, research has found that the daily\u00a0protein\u00a0requirement is approximately 1.6-2.2g (0.06-0.08oz) per kg of body weight to maximise muscle\u00a0protein\u00a0synthesis.\u00a0\nMany medical professionals recommend that people acquire the protein they need from their diets, wherever possible. For vegans, this can involve consuming more nuts, seeds and soya-based products, as well as pulses such as beans and lentils. For vegetarians, eggs, yoghurt and certain types of cheese can be added, while omnivores may also want to increase their consumption of meat and seafood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor many, consuming enough protein involves experimenting with different foods. However, not everyone has the time or money to acquire adequate protein through their diet alone.\u00a0\n\"Even though, theoretically, one can meet this target through a balanced diet rich in\u00a0protein-dense foods like lean meats, eggs, dairy and legumes, for many this may not be easy without supplementation,\" says Cyriac Abby Philips, a liver specialist at the Rajagiri Hospital in Kerala, India.\nLauren Manaker a dietician based in Charleston, South Carolina in the US, adds that protein powders \"do provide a convenient and portable option, especially for individuals with busy lifestyles or limited access to whole food sources\".\nGlobally, the protein powder market has been valued at $4.4bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2021, and is expected to grow to $19.3bn (\u00a315.6bn) by 2030. There are many formulations \u2013 both animal and plant-based, in the form of shakes, or added to nutrition bars, yoghurts and ready meals.\n\"When I incorporated plant-based protein powders into my diet, it became much easier to hit my protein goals\u2026 Over time, I experimented with different options and found that lean protein powders or whey protein worked best for me, as they are low in calories but high in protein,\" says Moulson.\nHowever, protein powders can come with risks, and there's some evidence in rats that they could lead to liver damage in those who are not exercising. There have also been rare cases of toxicity to the liver from whey and soy-based protein powders in humans.\u00a0\nProtein powders can also be misleadingly labelled and may contain harmful contaminants. For a recent study, Philips and colleagues from India and the US analysed protein powders sold in India. The team found that many powders contained more or less protein than they were marketed as having \u2013 leading to concerns about \"protein-spiking\" \u2013 as well as contaminants including heavy metals, fungal toxins and herbal extracts that may be toxic to the liver.\nToxins in protein powders may be more widespread than we think.\nIn 2018, a nonprofit group called the Clean Label Project, based in Broomfield, Colorado, released a report about toxins in popular brands of protein powders in the US. Researchers screened 134 products for 130 types of toxins and found that many protein powders contained heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury), bisphenol-A (or BPA, which is used to manufacture plastic), pesticides, or other contaminants with links to cancer and other health conditions. Some toxins were present in significant quantities.\nFor example, one protein powder contained 25 times the allowed limit of BPA in the US. The pesticides and chemicals came from agricultural residue and from the packaging of these powders, researchers observed. Interestingly, one certified \"organic\" product had twice the contaminants of non-certified ones. Plant-based protein powders were the most contaminated, while egg and whey-based powders were found to be the cleanest.\nBecause protein powders are considered dietary supplements and not pharmaceuticals, regulation from governing authorities tends to be more relaxed \u2013 in the US and the UK, they're considered food. This has led to concerns that they are not being regulated strictly enough.\nWhen increasing body muscle, it's not impossible to get your protein requirements through the foods you eat, but it can take considerable time and planning. The key to achieving your daily requirements is to eat protein at every meal and to plan your meals around a principal source of protein, says Patel.\n\"We're looking to aim for at least 20-30g (0.7-1.1oz) of protein per meal,\" says Patel. That would be the equivalent to a couple of eggs or some Greek yogurt with nuts sprinkled on top, or a chicken breast, or a piece of tofu that is the size of your fist.\n\"So, for example, you might have to have two eggs on sourdough toast with some avocado with some seeds sprinkled on top \u2013 with the eggs being the principal protein, the food source with the highest protein content,\" says Patel. \"In a meal that consists of beans or lentils with some rice, the lentils would be the principal protein.\"\nIf you decide to take a protein supplement instead or as well as altering your diet, there are a few simple rules for choosing one that is least likely to contain harmful substances. First of all, prioritise high-quality\u00a0proteins with minimal additives, says Philips.\n\"One must definitely avoid 'blended'\u00a0proteins\u00a0with herbal components as the risk of adulteration, contamination inclusive of the presence of heavy metals and fungal toxins are higher in these types of\u00a0protein\u00a0supplements,\" he says.\nManaker also advises that consumers do their research, particularly to avoid unnecessary ingredients. \"Look for protein powders that contain high-quality ingredients and have minimal additives, fillers or artificial sweeteners. Opt for brands that prioritise transparency and provide detailed information about the sourcing and processing of their ingredients,\" Manaker says.\nManaker also recommends considering the source of the protein in the powder. It's important to check labels to see if it's from whey, casein, soya, plant or animal-based proteins, she says. \"Choose a protein source that aligns with your dietary preferences, allergies or sensitivities.\"\nIf you're taking a protein supplement or powder, timing can play a role in optimising its benefits, says Manaker. \"Consuming protein within 30 minutes to an hour after a workout is often recommended to take advantage of the body's heightened ability to absorb and utilise nutrients during this time,\" she says.\nAnd the way you take protein powders matters. While protein supplements can be beneficial, it's crucial to avoid relying solely on them as a source of nutrition. \"Whole, nutrient-dense foods should form the foundation of your diet, and supplements should only complement a well-balanced eating plan. Avoid the temptation to replace meals entirely with protein powders, as this can lead to an inadequate intake of other essential nutrients,\" says Manaker.\nWith widespread access to protein powders and protein-rich foods today, some people do consume more protein than what they probably need, says Manaker. For example, while the average adult needs around 45-56 grams (1.6-2 ounces) of protein per day, in the UK people tend to consume around 75-100 grams (2.6-3.5 ounces). \u00a0While it is essential for muscle building and overall health, consuming an excessive amount of protein intake can have potential risks.\n\"High protein intake over a prolonged period can put strain on the kidneys,\" says Manaker. \"Individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions should be particularly cautious.\"\nFurthermore, a sudden increase in protein intake, especially from protein powders, can sometimes lead to digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas and constipation. \"Keep an eye on the way your body reacts, even as you tweak your protein [intake],\" says Patel.\nKeep in mind that it's easy to go overboard with protein powders. \"As a general guideline, I wouldn't recommend that people using protein powders exceed 80g [2.8oz] a day,\" says Patel. \"Even 80g of protein from protein powder is excessive for most people. It's going to completely displace whole foods that provide vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that we need. So in general, for most of my clients I tell them to stick with 20 to 40g [0.7-1.4oz] of protein powder per day.\"\nIn particular, problems tend to arise when one's diet is laser-focused only on proteins, says Patel. Micronutrients from fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates, which are also vital for a balanced diet, can end up being neglected.\nIn order to optimise your diet while weight training, ensure that you're including quality carbohydrates and prioritise micro-nutrients like Vitamin D, magnesium, iron and Omega 3 fats. \"They're all essential for optimum muscle contraction, bone health and energy. Eat fruits, vegetables and include oily fish in your diet at least once a week,\" says Patel.\nGetting enough protein is key to growing stronger muscles, but it's only one of the pillars of wellness, says Patel. \"The other pillars are physical activity, getting the training right and sleeping well,\" she says.\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "More than 250 people from 20 nationalities who had been working in telecom fraud centres in Myanmar's Karen State have been released by an ethnic armed group and brought to Thailand.\nThe workers, more than half of whom were from African or Asian nations, were received by the Thai army, and are being assessed to find out if they were victims of human trafficking.\nLast week Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and promised to shut down the scam centres which have proliferated along the Thai-Myanmar border.\nHer government has stopped access to power and fuel from the Thai side of the border, and toughened up banking and visa rules to try to prevent scam operators from using Thailand as a transit country for moving workers and cash.\nSome opposition MPs in Thailand have been pushing for this kind of action for the past two years.\nForeign workers are typically lured to these scam centres by offers of good salaries, or in some cases tricked into thinking they will be doing different work in Thailand, not Myanmar.\nThe scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and Chinese.\nThey are pressed into conducting online criminal activity, ranging from love scams known as \"pig butchering\" and crypto fraud, to money laundering and illegal gambling.\nSome are willing to do the work, but others are forced to stay, with release only possible if their families pay  large ransoms. Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured.\nThe released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State.\nThese armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds.\nThe Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948.\nOn Tuesday, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army. \nThe warrants included Saw Chit Thu, the Karen warlord who struck a deal in 2017 with a Chinese company to build Shwe Kokko, a new city believed to be largely funded by scams.\nThe BBC visited Shwe Kokko at the invitation of Yatai, the company which built the city. \nYatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour is not allowed, and that \"online businesses\" should leave. \nBut we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one.\nLike the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military.\nUnder pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories.\nThe DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers. \nThey included 221 men and 39 women, from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Uganda, Laos, Burundi, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sir Lanka, India, Ghana and Cambodia.",

Hundreds of foreigners freed from Myanmar's scam centres2 days agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia CorrespondentThai News PixMore than 250 people from 20 nationalities who had been working in telecom fraud centres in Myanmar's Karen State have been released by an ethnic armed group and brought to Thailand.The workers, more than half of whom were from African or Asian nations, were received by the Thai army, and are being assessed to find out if they were victims of human trafficking.Last week Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and promised to shut down the scam centres which have proliferated along the Thai-Myanmar border.Her government has stopped access to power and fuel from the Thai side of the border, and toughened up banking and visa rules to try to prevent scam operators from using Thailand as a transit country for moving workers and cash.Some opposition MPs in Thailand have been pushing for this kind of action for the past two years.Foreign workers are typically lured to these scam centres by offers of good salaries, or in some cases tricked into thinking they will be doing different work in Thailand, not Myanmar.The scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and Chinese.They are pressed into conducting online criminal activity, ranging from love scams known as \"pig butchering\" and crypto fraud, to money laundering and illegal gambling.Some are willing to do the work, but others are forced to stay, with release only possible if their families pay  large ransoms. Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured.The released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State.These armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds.The Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948.Thai News PixThe scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and ChineseOn Tuesday, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army. But we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one.Like the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military.Under pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories.The DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers. Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko.",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition of more than 200 photographs charts 300 years of image-making in the US, showing how the country's history and photography have run in parallel.\nIn 1840, using a self-made copper plate, Henry Fitz Jnr produced one of the world's first selfies, his eyes gently closed to prevent any blinking from spoiling the result. In creating this striking blue image, he was doing more than record his appearance; he was also documenting America's first essays into an art form that would tell its story in radical new ways.\nFitz's self-portrait, along with more than 200 other photographs, chart 300 years of image-making at the Rijksmuseum's newest exhibition American Photography, Europe's first comprehensive survey of this subject. Complemented by international loans, the exhibition showcases, for the first time, the museum's own collection of American images, which it has been busy expanding since 2007.\nFor co-curators Mattie Boom and Hans Rooseboom, the exhibition's starting point was to show the US through the differing perspectives of its photographers. Americans were \"using this medium as we [the Dutch] used painting in the 17th Century,\" Boom tells the BBC. \"America and photography run parallel. The medium is so connected with the country.\"\nThe exhibition has deliberately departed from a \"top 100\" approach, Rooseboom adds, stating \"that would have been too easy\". Instead, works by icons such as Robert Frank, Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus sit alongside mementos, postcards and adverts \u2013 \"surprisingly good images that nobody knows,\" he says.\nA 19th-Century tintype (an image made on a sheet of metal) featuring a man and woman in front of a rustic barn is a case in point. The image was probably sold on the spot by a travelling tin typist \"for a modest price\", explains Rooseboom. \"Many people had just arrived and were living in the countryside, no big city nearby, so this was the only possibility of having your portrait taken.\" The man stands proud, looking at the camera, but the woman's head is bowed and she is looking away. \"Sometimes you can sense that people were simply not used to being photographed,\" says Rooseboom. \"Nowadays, we've seen in magazines and movies how to pose elegantly.\" This may be the only time in their whole life that they would be photographed, and the result, adds Boom, \"would hang on the wall of the house where they lived forever\".\nBy contrast, a 1913 postcard featuring 12,000 employees of the Ford Motor Company in Detroit may have been the \"most expensive picture that was ever taken\", quipped a newspaper at the time, as the factory had to shut down for two hours to assemble the staff. The image, the company boasted, was \"the largest specially posed group picture ever made\" and illustrates a turning point where industry saw the value in investing large sums in promotional photography. Taken in the year when Ford introduced America's first moving assembly line and the US had become the world's largest economy, the photograph also depicts the mass production that would shape the country.\nThe image's reappearance in Ford marketing also made it an early example of photoshopping. While the same tinted faces swarmed in the foreground, the number of employees cited in the caption increased exponentially, and a building to the left was cropped out in one version and acquired extra floors in another. \"Apparently, many photographers and their publishers had no qualms about abandoning their medium's potential for realism,\" write Boom and Rooseboom in the exhibition catalogue.\nA decade on, the New York portrait photographer James Van Der Zee was also embellishing his work, drawing jewellery on to his subjects and retouching their faces to erase dark lines and wrinkles. \"I put my heart and soul into them and tried to see that every picture was better looking than the person,\" he said. As a black photographer working from his Harlem studio at the height of the Harlem Renaissance, his work records a period when black migrants fleeing the segregationist South were forging a new life for themselves in the urban North. For the first time, African Americans and other minority groups could be photographed by someone inside their community, and represented in a way that uplifted them. Van Der Zee's Portrait of an Unknown Man (1938), for example, is carefully posed to suggest confidence. The outfit is elegant and the buttonhole daisy adds a dandyish flourish. It's an image that reflects the aspirations and upward mobility of African-American people and the pride Van Der Zee had in his culture.\nIt is the Chinese-American community that is the focus of the work of Irene Poon, who grew up in San Francisco's Chinatown, where her parents, first-generation immigrants from Guanghzou, ran a herbalist store. A 1965 image features Poon's sister Virginia in a local sweet shop, crowded out by Hershey's and Nestl\u00e9 bars. The letters \"Nest\" peep out from the densely packed shelves, reinforcing a sense that she is enclosed by this mass of graphic lettering. Beside her head a \"Look\" bar competes for attention, hinting at that other ever-expanding role for American photography: advertising \u2212 a sector in which the US was a forerunner. \"Many of the 20th-Century artists started in advertising. It's part of art history,\" Boom says. \"This whole field already existed, and the arts, and photography as an art form, draws from it.\"\nOne of the exhibition's most powerful images, Stars and Stripes Forever? (1970) was created by New York advertising photographer Bill Stettner, who sought to elevate the status of commercial photography, and successfully campaigned for photographers to retain the rights to their work. \"I'd like to think that what I'm doing, which is clearly commercial photography for advertising, is an art,\" he told an interviewer for the 1980s television series World of Photography.\nStars and Stripes Forever?, his best-known work, was originally just a sample, made, he said, \"out of necessity\" to boost his portfolio following a financial downturn. The work takes its name from a patriotic march and features a US flag made from matches that has just caught fire, suggesting, perhaps, the fragility of the US and the principles that founded it. \"Commercial photography is very often overlooked and not collected by museums, but it's a fascinating field pictorially,\" says Rooseboom. \"You find the precursors of Modernism in advertising, but hardly anyone knows about this and [hardly anyone] has been collecting it or showing it in exhibitions.\"\nIn the post-war years, mass immigration to the US brought new ways of thinking. the US took over from Europe as a cultural trendsetter, and photography was eventually accepted as an art form. Playful approaches to photography emerged, moving beyond documenting people and places to provoking emotion and inviting deep questions. Ming Smith's America Seen Through Stars and Stripes (1976), created on the bicentenary of the Declaration of Independence, turns again to the flag inviting America to reflect on its history. By placing a figure in mirrored sunglasses in front of a shop window, she creates a disorientating mesh of reflective surfaces. The grid structure suggests incarceration but \u2013 in combination with the round glasses and the stars on the flag \u2013 also creates an abstract composition reminiscent of modern art. \"She's a careful observer, playing with all these layers in the image,\" says Boom.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Eight vintage photos of the quirkiest US groups\n\u2022 The photos that skewer British peculiarities\n\u2022 Eight photos showing 'death of the American dream'\nSmith explores the artistic potential of photography, experimenting with double-exposure, shutter speed and collage. In one version of this image, she paints on bold red stripes, altering this snapshot of the US with marks that resemble blood or flames. Smith's work builds on the civil rights movement that preceded it and features activists such as James Baldwin and Alvin Ailey. She was the first woman to join the African-American photography collective the Kamoinge Workshop and the first black woman to have her work acquired by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Yet her demographic was largely overlooked by the art world. \"I worked to capture black culture, the richness, the love. That was my incentive,\" she told the Financial Times in 2019. \"It wasn't like I was going to make money from it, or fame - not even love, because there were no shows.\"\nThe political power of photography is also seen in the work of Native American (Seminole-Muscogee-Navajo) photographer Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie who uses the camera to correct misconceptions about Indigenous populations and to offer an alternative viewpoint on US history. \"No longer is the camera held by an outsider looking in, the camera is held with brown hands opening familiar worlds,\" she writes in a 1993 essay. \"We document ourselves with a humanising eye, we create new visions with ease, and we can turn the camera and show how we see you.\"\u00a0\nTsinhnahjinnie's captioning of a touristic image of Monument Valley, Arizona with This is not a commercial, this is my homeland highlights the commodification of American land, and uses what she calls \"photographic sovereignty\" to take us back to the very beginning and reclaim and retell the story of America. In combination with works such as Bryan Schutmaat's Tonopah, Nevada\u00a0(2012), which documents mining's effect on the landscape of the American West, images like Tsinhnahjinnie's tell a story of a beautiful land that means different things to different people: financial gain, security or a sacred space. As the camera has passed from hand to hand, the American stories have multiplied. \"American photography is a much richer and wider field than even we knew,\" says Rooseboom. \"There's still so much to be discovered.\"\nAmerican Photography is at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam until 9 June 2025. The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue American Photography \u2013 America through Photographers' Eyes, by Mattie Boom and Hans Rooseboom.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature. If we aren't, well, we probably don't really believe something is inherently better because it's natural.\nMeanwhile, there are hundreds of things that we might consider not to be natural that, in fact, have made life quite a lot better for many of us. Prior to modern medicine, more than one in 100 women died in childbirth. In wealthy, industrialised countries such as the UK today, it is more like one in 10,000. Before vaccinations were rolled out globally, whooping cough (pertussis) killed one out of every 10 children infected. After the global roll-out, deaths fell to a fraction \u2013 1/157, specifically \u2013 of what they had been before.\nThat's just medicine. Look around you right now, and you'll see a dozen more examples. It's may not be \"natural\" to wear glasses, refrigerate food, or turn on the heating in winter, for example \u2013 but for many of us, it's a better alternative than walking around near-blind, leaving meat to spoil or shivering in the cold.\nMuch of the food we eat does not come to us as nature presents it. We process and cook it. The harvesting, grinding and processing of grains helped to drive the transition of our species from being nomadic hunter gatherers into settled farmers capable of building sophisticated civilisations. So, too, did the way in which we cultivated and cross-bred crops \u2013 meaning that many of the nutritious foods we consider \"natural\" today, from the orange carrot to the modern banana, look (and taste) far different than their wild forebears.\nOf course, it would be wrong to suggest that human-made products don't also cause us problems, whether pollution from synthetic plastics to the use of guns and explosives. Nor does it mean that, in many cases, the more \"natural\" option is not better for us. But it does mean that we cannot assume the more \"natural\" option is better just because it's natural \u2013 despite a frequent tendency for people to believe the contrary. Carrots might be better for us than crisps, but so too is paracetamol versus arsenic.\nSome of these examples hint at one of the other main problems with the \"appeal to nature\" \u2013 how can you delineate what is, and what isn't, natural at all? Humans, after all, come from nature. So, if anything an animal or plant produces is \"natural\", why isn't anything that humans do? And what of those creations that are blends of what we'd traditionally consider natural and man-made \u2013 like vaccinations, which are derived from the parts of a (natural) virus or bacteria, and, when injected, help teach your immune system how to (naturally) fend off that same pathogen in the future?\n\"Like all truly interesting words, 'nature' is a mille-feuille of meanings,\" writes the science historian Lorraine Daston. It can mean almost anything, depending on the context. This slipperiness, of course, is exactly what makes it such clever language for marketing \u2013 and makes it so easy for us to fall for.\nThere's another problem, too: even if there were a clear-cut delineation between \"humans\" and \"nature\", we're often not very good at knowing what is actually synthetic, versus what is not.\nTake brushing our teeth. Is it natural to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste? What about to brush your teeth with a non-fluoride toothpaste?\nFor many of us, our instinct might be to say that brushing with fluoride is unnatural, while brushing with non-fluoride toothpaste is natural. But fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that can be found in soil, water and rocks, while one of its common replacements in \"natural\" toothpastes, nano-hydroxyapatite, is synthetic. And, of course, we'd need to consider that cleaning one's teeth, certainly with the items we use today, is far from natural; the closest primates get to brushing their teeth is \"flossing\" with whatever is on hand (like bird feathers). Even if we wanted to brush our teeth the way that our human ancestors did, we'd need to scrub our teeth with a twig, pig hairs or even porcupine quills.\nMeanwhile, if I told you that I had made a drink for you that was made up of 99% dihydrogen monoxide, would you recoil? This chemical name sounds pretty synthetic, after all, until you think about it.\nDihydrogen monoxide is, of course, two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. You might be more familiar to see it written in chemical shorthand: H2O. In other words, water.\nThe next time you see a product being marketed on the basis that it is natural \u2013 or see someone arguing against something because it is not \u2013 it is worth questioning what is really being meant. And, perhaps, questioning why it is that those behind the product or practice are leaning on the \"appeal to nature\" fallacy to persuade an audience of its merits \u2013 rather than simply laying out the logical argument for just why it is actually the better option.\n* Amanda Ruggeri is an award-winning science and features journalist.

        "article_text": "Becoming Led Zeppelin is a new authorised documentary that tells the \"untold story\" of the band, who despite achieving global influence and legendary status, are difficult to define.\nRock's mightiest anthems, and the tales surrounding them, tend to be continually replayed \u2013 and sometimes, their power fades over time. Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Moments in human history are etched into the Earth. Now researchers are piecing together evidence of our impact on the planet \u2013 through the marks we've left on nature.\nThe microbes living in this French harbour have never recovered from World War Two. Between 2012 and 2017, Raffaele Siano pulled sediment cores from the seabed at Brest harbour, wondering what he was going to find. When he and his colleagues at the French Institute for Ocean Science (Ifremer), analysed the fragments of DNA captured in those cores \u2013 they discovered something remarkable.\nThe oldest, deepest layers of sediment \u2013 dating to before 1941 \u2013 had traces of plankton called dinoflagellates that were strikingly different to the genetic traces of plankton left in the shallower, more recent layers. \"There was a group, an order of these dinoflagellates, that was very abundant before World War Two \u2013 and after World War Two it almost disappeared,\" says Siano. He and his colleagues published a study detailing their findings in 2021.\nSiano mentions that Brest harbour had been bombed during the war. Then, in 1947, a Norwegian cargo ship exploded in the Bay of Brest. The disaster killed 22 people and spread ammonium nitrate, a toxic chemical used to make fertiliser and explosives, into the sea. Even younger sediment in the 1980s and 1990s showed further changes in the plankton community in the harbour. \"We correlated this from another type of pollution coming from intensive agricultural activities,\" says Siano.\nNature has a way of remembering things. Echoes of certain human activities, especially highly-polluting ones, sometimes show up in tree rings, coastal sediments and ecosystems. Arguably, these traces are hints of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch in which humanity is said to have irrevocably, and drastically, altered Earth. Human history, it turns out, is written into the very fabric of our planet \u2013 and the life that co-exists here with us.\nSiano and his colleagues are predominantly ecologists but they also work with historians. \"The land changed because of human impact and also because of historical events,\" Siano says. When the team analysed the sediment cores from Brest, they also detected a gradual rise in heavy metal pollution as time passed. Younger layers of sediment contained higher volumes of mercury, copper, lead and zinc, for example.\nThe report notes there were similar levels of some of these metals \u2013 especially lead and chromium \u2013 in Pearl Harbour, a major US naval base in Hawaii that was heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes in 1941. However, Siano adds that he can't be sure whether these metals came directly from the bombs themselves. Either way, there is a signal in both Brest and Pearl Harbour of a calamitous, and polluting, moment in human history.\nOther researchers have also scoured the planet in search of geological records of anthropogenic pollution. In China, soil sediments reveal a sharp increase in metal contamination since 1950 \u2013 which correlates with a rise in air pollution there during the second half of the 20th Century. A separate study explores how the emergence of industries such as shipbuilding may be linked with a higher incidence of heavy metal deposits in tree rings from certain parts of China.\nEven Roman metallurgy, from many centuries ago, has left its mark. One 2022 study found a noticeable rise in lead contamination in ice, sediment and peat cores from Europe, correlated with the development of Roman industry. It is sometimes difficult to be sure which specific events caused spikes in lead contamination, however, note the authors.\nJean-Luc Loizeau at the University of Geneva has studied the sediment of Lake Geneva, particularly the material found in a small area of the lake near to a wastewater treatment plant. He says the sediment there contains many traces of human activities. Crucially, the way water moves around in this part of the lake has helped to preserve such clues.\n\"It accumulates because there is a kind of gyre that keeps the sediment within the bay,\" he says, referring to Vidy Bay, on the northern shores of the lake. In a 2017 paper, he and colleagues describe the heavy metal pollution that became evident here in sediment layers dating to the 1930s. Among the specific examples he gives is a spike in mercury contamination during the 1970s.\n\"We know there was an accident in one of these industries,\" explains Loizeau. \"There was some spilling of mercury because there was a break in a tank and we really find this peak in the sediment.\" Plus, traces of elements such as barium in the cores could be linked to the rise of the automobile, adds Loizeau \u2013 because car brakes often contain barium.\nBesides metals, radioactive materials have also found applications in various industries. In Switzerland, for instance, radium was long used to make glow-in-the-dark details on watch faces. Remnants of radium from the watchmaking industry have turned up in landfill sites and buildings in the country.\nAnd scattered around the globe are pieces of evidence that reveal the grim legacy left by nuclear weapons during the 20th Century. Take the giant craters in the Nevada desert made by huge weapons tests, for example. But some contamination caused by nuclear detonations is much more subtle.\nIn 2019, researchers revealed that some of the grains of sand on beaches near the Japanese city of Hiroshima are in fact particles of debris created when the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city on 6 August 1945, towards the end of World War Two. \"The chemical composition of the melt debris provides clues to their origin, particularly with regard to city building materials,\" the authors wrote. In other words, the bomb turned buildings into dust, heat from the explosion reshaped that dust, and the blast ultimately spread this material across the nearby landscape \u2013 marking it forever.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nRemnants of nuclear explosions are not confined to the outdoors. They may be in your attic, too. Attic dust often lies undisturbed for decades \u2013 unlike urban soil, which is more likely to be disturbed \u2013 so traces of contaminants may remain.\nA study published in 2003 reports the results of a survey of 201 homes in the US state of New Jersey. Among the traces the researchers found there were lead concentrations that roughly correlated with the prevalence of lead in air pollution during the 20th Century. But they also found small amounts of Caesium-137, a radioactive isotope. This was more common the older the property was and could perhaps be explained, the researchers suggest, by the frequency of above ground nuclear weapons tests in the US \u2013 especially during the 1950s and 1960s.\nSiano and his colleagues are now looking further afield in their search for clues of human history embedded in nature. The team has collected more than 120 sediment cores from nine different countries around Europe, with the hope of finding further correlations between historical events and trace DNA or metal contamination left in those cores.\u00a0\n\"We can look for the impacts of the Vesuvius volcano [eruption] in Naples,\" says Siano, noting that the volcano last erupted in 1944. And here, as in other locations, the team may also detect signs of radioactive material ejected during the Chernobyl disaster \u2013 contamination from the accident having spread to over 40% of Europe.\u00a0\nAnd in yet more places, says Siano, evidence of everything from oil spills to the development of oyster farms may have been locked away in the sediment. \"We have all the material to answer these questions,\" he says.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Ever since absinthe was outlawed due to rumours it led to insanity, this simple drink has become the nation's go-to apertif.\nIt's difficult to imagine France without ap\u00e9ro (aperitif hour), that magic moment when time stops, and suddenly, everyone has a drink in hand.\u00a0\nIn a country so proud of its regional products, it's not surprising that the contents of one's aperitif glass varies, from cassis-scented kir in Burgundy to beer on the Belgian border to cloudy aniseed-infused pastis in Marseille. But despite its strong association with southern France, conjuring images of lazy summer afternoons playing p\u00e9tanque by the sea, one ap\u00e9ro spirit is omnipresent in France: pastis. Not only do sales of pastis represent one-fifth of all spirits sold nationwide, but it's the default aperitif drink as far north as Picardie.\n\"It's not like some of those other regional aperitifs,\" said Forest Collins, author of the book Drink Like a Local: Paris. \"Pineau de Charentes, you're mainly going to find around Cognac. Pommeau, you're mainly going to find in Normandy. But it's pretty likely that anywhere in France, you might find a bottle of pastis.\"\nYet, pastis didn't become France's go-to aperitif by design. If not for the nation's 1915 ban of absinthe due to its alleged harmful effects and the marketing chops of Marseillais Paul Ricard, the herbal liqueur may never have become France's most famous.\nAbsinthe's quiet conquest of France occurred in the wake of the 19th Century phylloxera epidemic that wiped out nearly half of the country's vineyards. Soon, it supplanted not just wine but beer in the north, cider in Normandy and flavoured wines like quinquina, explained Marie-Claude Delahaye, author of the book L'Absinthe: Histoire de la F\u00e9e Verteand founder of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Absinthe in Auvers-sur-Oise. According to Delahaye, absinthe introduced aniseed to the aperitif hour, along with a \"playful and convivial ritual\" of diluting the 75% ABV liquor with sugar and water.\n\"It was the sprout of what could be an extraordinary success,\" Delahaye said. Yet, absinthe's rise to fame was stymied in 1915, when it was banned throughout the country following rumours that it led to insanity. Aficionados immediately began clamouring for something to fill the aniseed-scented gap. \"If absinthe had continued to be commercialised,\" explained Delahaye, \"pastis never would have appeared.\"\nWhile pastis and absinthe share an aniseed flavour profile, the similarities stop there. Distilled absinthe boasts more complexity than sweetened, macerated pastis, and at 40 to 45% ABV, pastis' alcoholic power pales in comparison. This put pastis at an advantage, according to Collins: absinthe, she said, was seen as \"the drink of degenerate artists\" (including Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse Lautrec and Vincent Van Gogh, who even included the spirit in some of his paintings). With pastis, meanwhile, drinkers still got \"that nice little buzz, and that nice aniseed flavour\" without the negative connotations.\n\"I think that's the effect that pastis had on aperitif culture,\" Collins said. \"It allowed this drinking culture of aniseed to carry on.\"\nOrder a pastis in most cafes, and it'll be poured from a bottle emblazoned with a bright yellow sun and one name: Ricard. But before there was Ricard, there was Pernod \u2013 two Pernods, to be precise. Both Henri-Louis Pernod and the unrelated Jules-F\u00e9lix Pernod launched anisettes in 1918, merging their companies in 1928. Ricard, meanwhile, only began selling his version in 1932. If Ricard's became the most famous, it's in large part thanks to his marketing chops. He appealed immediately to the French love of terroir, deriving the name of his anisette from the Proven\u00e7al pastisson(mixture), and attributing his recipe to \"a poacher \u2026 who knew all of the herbs of the mountains and the garriguesurrounding us\". He soon set about disseminating the story \u2013 and the local liqueur \u2013 by going door to door to bistros and cafes across France.\nHow to ap\u00e9ro\nAp\u00e9ro hour usually takes place between 18:00 and 19:30, when France's squares and terraces fill with groups sipping golden demis of beer, pink kirs and pastis. Cafes typically serve a free bowl of crisps, pretzels or olives with your chosen ap\u00e9ro, though the food is secondary to the drinks and conversation. Ap\u00e9ro isn't about inebriation, and it's not uncommon for friends to nurse a drink for an hour before parting ways to have dinner at home.\n\"He used to say, 'Make a friend a day,'\" said Gabrielle Arevikian-Xerri, brand director of Pernod-Ricard.\nPerhaps Ricard's most successful initiative was merch. An amateur artist, Ricard created branded posters evoking sunny Marseille, not to mention glasses and ashtrays, bucket hats and caps. He released thousands of such objects during the 1948 Tour de France; today, they're omnipresent at French flea markets, where keen collectors track them down.\nJacky Roussial is one such collector. Over 39 years, Roussial has amassed no fewer than 3,500 Ricard-branded objects, including 180 different goblets, playing cards and umbrellas. His most prized pastis possession is a pichet tambourin, a 1950s-era pitcher depicting a tambourine player he dubs \"the grail of any collector\". It goes for about \u20ac4,000.\nThese pitchers aren't just trinkets; they're an essential part of serving pastis, a drink that's customisable by design. Each 2cl pour is meant to be diluted with water to taste. Many also sweeten their pastis with syrup: a blend of bright green mint and pastis is called a perroquet (parrot), while the addition of grenadine makes a tomate (tomato). Of them, Arevikian-Xerri said, the mauresque (a blend of pastis and local southern orgeat) is the most popular.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A Michelin-starred chef's guide to Marseille\n\u2022 The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nIn recent years, modern mixologists have been toying with crafting more complex pastis cocktails. Margot Lecarpentier of Paris cocktail bar Combat likes blending it with cacha\u00e7a to highlight floral notes, while Aur\u00e9lie Panhelleux, co-founder of CopperBay cocktail bars in both Marseille and Paris, combines it with gin, lemon juice, dill-infused orgeat and citron to create the house Mauresco. But these creations remain anecdotal at best, according to Collins, who said that while there was an attempt to make a pastis-scented play on an Ap\u00e9rol Spritz popular about a decade ago, \"it hasn't really happened.\"\n\"I think the traditional way is the way that pretty much anybody drinks pastis,\" she said.\nEven Lecarpentier agrees. \"Ninety-five percent of French people will tell you pastis is drunk with a glass of water and ice cubes,\" she said. \"It would be weird to not serve it like that.\"\nPastis does incur a ritual, of sorts, as the drinker dilutes the spirit with water from a branded pitcher until it takes on its cloudy-yellow hue, adding syrup or ice to taste. According to Collins, the relative simplicity of how pastis is served \u2013 especially compared to absinthe, which was dripped into a glass through a sugar cube set on a special perforated spoon \u2013 is part of the drink's enduring popularity. \"Everyone in their house can have a little pitcher, but not everybody is going to go out and get an absinthe fountain and absinthe spoons,\" she said.\nPastis' accessibility has cemented its place as the aperitif to rule all aperitifs. Drunk by men and women, by young and old, pastis is above all, according to Arevikian-Xerri, \"for bringing people together. Whatever their background, whatever their social status.\"\nBut it's not just pastis that remains popular \u2013 it's Ricard. Other brands exist, of course, from high-end Henri Bardouin to organic Distillerie de la Plaine. Even Pernod, which merged with its one-time rival in 1975, has stood the test of time. But in 2022, Ricard wasn't just the most-sold pastis in France; it was the most-sold product in French hypermarkets, outranking mineral water, Coca-Cola and Nutella. In the leadup to Christmas 2024, Ricard outsold even Champagne.\n\"Pastis is a question of taste, and often of tradition,\" said Panhelleux. \"In France, it's the only spirit people order by brand.\"\n\"I don't drink pastis,\" echoed Roussial. \"I drink Ricard.\"\nSome of the drink's popularity still stems from the fantasy Ricard constructed. \"It's the symbol of sunshine, of holidays, of the Mediterranean, of far niente (the art of doing nothing), of conviviality,\" said Roussial. But connotations aside, for Collins, its charm comes above all from its omnipresence.\n\"For most people, it's just a way of life. Almost like a [table wine],\" she said.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "There's a new race in space, but it's not where you might think. It's happening close to home \u2013 in the nearest bit of space, right on the edge of Earth's atmosphere.\nHigh in the skies of Earth, a new space race is underway. Here, just above the boundary where space begins, companies are trying to create a new class of daring satellites. Not quite high-altitude planes and not quite low-orbiting satellites, these sky skimmers are designed to race around our planet in an untapped region, with potentially huge benefits on offer.\nRoughly 10,000 satellites are orbiting our planet right now, at speeds of up to 17,000mph (27,000km/h). Every one of these delicate contraptions is in constant free-fall and would drop straight back down to Earth were it not for the blistering speeds at which they travel. It's their considerable sideways momentum, perfectly stabilised against the Earth's gravitational pull downwards, that keeps satellites in orbit.\nA new class of satellites is aiming to push the limits of this balancing act and plough a much more precarious, lower orbit that would skim the top of Earth's atmosphere. Known as Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO), spacecraft at these altitudes have to battle against the significantly greater drag from the air in the upper reaches of the atmosphere than their loftier cousins, lest they get pushed out of the sky. Should they manage it, however, such satellites might achieve something even more jaw-dropping \u2013 they could potentially fly forever.\n\"When you start describing it to people, it starts to sound like a perpetual motion machine,\" says Spence Wise, senior vice-president at Redwire, an aerospace firm in Florida. A perpetual motion machine is not meant to be possible. But it almost is, in this instance.\nA handful of pioneering companies have begun work on designs for satellites that may be able to orbit the planet at these unusually low altitudes while simultaneously harvesting air and using it to make propellant \u2013 literally on the fly. This new generation of orbiters could enable ultra-high-definition surveillance of activities on the ground, or superfast satellite-based communications.\nIf you want to send something into orbit, you have to decide how high your satellite is going to fly. Earth orbits are generally described in terms of altitude and are categorised into different sections. In high orbits, 22,000 miles (36,000km) above Earth, satellites enter a geostationary position, meaning they are always above the same location on Earth below. This is useful for telecommunications and weather monitoring, for example. Next is Medium Earth orbit, which spans from roughly 22,000 miles (36,000km) down to 1,200 miles (2,000km) above the planet's surface. Below this is Low Earth orbit, which stretches down to altitudes of 250 miles (400km), where the International Space Station (ISS) is found.\nEven further below this lies VLEO, loosely defined as anything below the ISS and down to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km). Operating here is difficult because of the influence of Earth's atmosphere. \"The atmosphere will increase exponentially as you come down,\" says Hugh Lewis, a professor of astronautics and a space debris expert at the University of Southampton in the UK.\nThat creates more drag on your satellite, which can spell doom. As molecules in the atmosphere smash into the satellite, they rob the vehicle of its momentum, causing the tug of our planet's gravity to drag it towards the ground.\nA satellite left in medium Earth orbit or above would carry on circling our planet for millennia. In VLEO, however, it would last barely months, weeks, or even days depending on its speed, shape and mass, dictating the amount of drag it produces and thus its lifetime. Once a satellite dips to an altitude of about 60 miles (100km), the end is imminent. The intense friction created by the thicker atmosphere subjects the satellite to temperatures of thousands of degrees, ultimately tearing it apart.\nAll satellites pass through VLEO on their way up or down, but not many have purposefully tried to stay there. One such spacecraft, however, was the European Space Agency's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. Launched in 2009, it orbited at an altitude of around 155 miles (250km), using an ion propulsion system to fire out charged particles behind the spacecraft. This gave it a constant level of thrust that could counteract the drag of the atmosphere.\nGOCE was intended to measure Earth's gravitational field with extreme precision, which it achieved. But it also demonstrated the design choices that were necessary for operating in VLEO. It had a sleek, elongated form that helped it to overcome atmospheric drag. \"It looked like a dart,\" says Lewis. GOCE ultimately ran out of fuel and burned up in the atmosphere on re-entry in 2013.\nSeveral companies are now trying to do something even more impressive. They are developing technology to harvest molecules from the thin layer of air that is present in VLEO in order to actually propel satellites here. Such a system, called Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP), has been made possible by advancements in electric and ion propulsion in recent years. In essence, it involves fixing a large bucket or opening to the front of the satellite, into which gas molecules from the atmosphere flow before they are ionised to create plasma that generates thrust.\n\"The idea is to use the same air slowing down your satellite as a propellant,\" says Francesco Romano, a scientist at the Swiss Plasma Center in Lausanne, Switzerland, who has previously studied this technology. Using electric and magnetic fields, the engine would ionise gas from the atmosphere, taking away one electron from each molecule, to produce a free electron and an ion. Then, using magnets, the electrons and ions are pushed out the back of the spacecraft, producing thrust. \"Theoretically, if you can generate a thrust that is the same as your drag, you stay at this altitude for an infinite amount of time,\" says Romano.\nTo date, an assortment of experimental ABEP systems have been able to produce relatively small amounts of thrust at ground level, but their feasibility in orbit has yet to be properly tested.\nOne company investigating the potential of ABEP is Stellar Advanced Concepts in London. Together with another\u00a0firm in the Netherlands and the University of Manchester, the company\u00a0received a grant of \u00a3390,000 ($510,000) from the British government towards their efforts in July 2024. They hope to launch a demonstration of the technology into space by 2027. \"That would be a small satellite with a small payload, maybe an Earth observation camera of some kind, as a proof of principle,\" says Newsam.\nA start-up called Kreios Space, based in Vigo, Spain, is also working on an ABEP prototype it aims to fly by 2026. In Kreios's case, this would be a small satellite \"that allows us to do all the testing in orbit in different altitudes,\" says Adri\u00e1n Senar Tejedor, the company's CEO and co-founder. The optimal altitude for thrust and drag balancing is expected to be between 125 to 155 miles (200 to 250km). \"That's the sweet spot,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nBut he points out that significant contracts for developing this technology are emerging on the other side of the Atlantic.\nThe US Department of Defense's Otter program has already committed more than $20m (\u00a316m) to help several companies develop air-breathing VLEO satellites. One of them, Redwire is designing a sleek \"orbital drone\" called SabreSat.\nRedwire's design for a satellite has solar panels facing edge-on to its motion, like the fins of a fish, in order to reduce drag on the spacecraft. The company says SabreSat would be able to spend up to seven years in VLEO. The build would be modular, so that different versions of the satellite could fly with different instruments on board. \"You can think of it like a ship,\" says Wise. \"It has bulkheads, and we're able to add additional bulkheads to increase the length.\"\nThe European arm of Redwire is concurrently developing its own VLEO satellite, called Phantom, as part of a European Space Agency (Esa) project called Skimsat. \"We're currently in the middle of the design stage, and the team is working towards a launch in 2027 or 2028,\" says Juan Pablo Ramos, business development manager for Redwire in Antwerp, Belgium.\nPhantom will not use air-breathing technology, however. Instead, it will rely on a specific blend of undisclosed materials on the satellite to reduce drag and an aerodynamic cone-shaped front. \"The cone is designed to improve drag and protect the instruments,\" says Ramos.\nGetting to orbit soon is important. \"I expect it to become increasingly popular,\" says Newsam. \"I do think it's important to have first-mover advantage. Whoever gains the credibility of being able to produce an ABEP system, they would win the orders. But there should end up being a reasonably big market.\"\nThere are some very good reasons for operating a satellite in VLEO. The first is Earth imaging \u2013 the closer you are to Earth, the higher resolution your images can be. \"You could either have smaller cameras and gain the same quality of data, or the same camera and get a higher resolution,\" adds Newsam.\nThat might be useful for the military, but also for civilian purposes too. \"There are lots of applications in maritime, agriculture, wildfire monitoring,\" says Senar Tejedor. And there could be scientific benefits from studying the atmosphere in VLEO. Putting sensors on satellites operating here \"would be a dream\", says Sean Elvidge, an assistant professor of space environment at the University of Birmingham in the UK. \"It would tell us an awful lot about the environment.\"\nThe other major application of being in VLEO is that you are closer to the ground for communications. That is particularly useful for space internet services, like SpaceX's Starlink network, which currently beams the internet to receivers on the ground from higher orbits. By using lower satellites in VLEO, the antennas can act like mobile phone towers and beam the internet straight to your phone. \"Going direct to a cell phone is a challenging task to do from space,\" says Tim Farrar, a satellite communications expert in California. \"These lower [orbits] could enable a direct-to-cell constellation.\"\nThe overall global market for VLEO satellite services could be vast. \"We expect it to be around $15bn (\u00a311.5bn) in 2032,\" says Senar Tejedor.\nAn oft-touted benefit of VLEO, aside from the various novel applications, is that this kind of orbit is self-cleaning. Generally, defunct or dead satellites in VLEO will eventually fall back into the deeper atmosphere and break up, limiting the volume of space junk that would otherwise be left orbiting Earth.\nWhile this is true, Lewis points out that debris generated in VLEO can sometimes get flung into higher orbits, posing problems for other satellites. An Indian anti-satellite missile test in VLEO in 2019, for example, sent debris up to an altitude of 870 miles (1,400km) and it remained in orbit for 18 months, says Lewis. \"If you have a collision or energetic explosion, some of those fragments can be ejected into larger orbits,\" he says. \"It's not this perfect environment.\"\nHaving lots of new satellites potentially operating in VLEO is also going to make for a complicated environment, says Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at the Secure World Foundation in Washington DC in the US. Operating in VLEO is \"not a cut and dry thing\", says Samson.\nAt such altitudes, satellites are particularly sensitive to the effects of the Sun, since heat can shrink or swell Earth's atmosphere as solar activity waxes and wanes. This caused trouble for 38 newly launched SpaceX Starlink satellites in 2022 when a geomagnetic storm caused the amount of atmospheric drag to increase by up to 50%, causing them to be pulled back towards Earth and burn up. It is a risk that will need to be carefully monitored by keeping a close eye on space weather forecasts, says Samson.\nYet there's little doubt about the rising interest in this poorly exploited region at the very edge of space. \"There is a race,\" says Senar Tejedor. And whoever can crack VLEO first will usher in a new era of space technology.\n* This article has been updated to clarify that Redwire will not achieve limitless VLEO with its SabreSat satellite under its contract with Darpa. It will be able to support a mission lifetime of up to seven years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Some of the biggest tech companies in the world served ads on a website featuring images of child abuse, helping to fund its operations. It shines a light into the dark corners of digital advertising.\nSometimes you come across an image online that's so horrifying you can't unsee it. For Krzysztof Franaszek, it happened at work.\nFranaszek runs the advertising research firm Adalytics based in the US. Recently, he was studying where ads for the US Department of Homeland Security end up online, and the project took him to an image-sharing website called ImgBB. There, Franaszek uncovered something sickening: sexually explicit images of a very young child, with adverts for Fortune 500 companies running alongside them.\nHe immediately reported the content to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and child safety organisations. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection \u2013 one of those Franaszek alerted \u2013 says it found at least 35 images flagged by Adalytics on the site that meet its classification of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The Centre says it notified ImgBB, and the images were taken down. An FBI spokesperson says the bureau reviews all allegations of criminal conduct but does not comment on tips from the public. The DHS did not respond to questions.\nThe more Franaszek dug, the clearer the problem became \u2013 and his findings raise questions about how the adverts you see online may also be inadvertently pumping large sums of money into undesirable, and at times illegal, corners of the internet.\nAccording to a new report from Adalytics, advertising systems run by companies including Google, Amazon and Microsoft have inadvertently funnelled money to the owners of a website hosting illegal images of child sex abuse. In addition to CSAM, Adalytics documented ads for more than 70 large organisations and Fortune 500 companies running alongside hardcore adult pornography, including MasterCard, Nestl\u00e9, Starbucks, Unilever and even the US Government. \"Many advertisers whose ads appeared on this website probably had no idea that they were funding this kind of content,\" Franaszek says.\nOn 7 February 2025, US Senators Marsha Blackburn and Richard Blumenthal sent letters to Amazon, Google and other ad tech companies mentioned in the report, demanding answers about whether this problem represents a widespread issue across the internet. \"The dissemination of [child sexual abuse material] is a heinous crime that inflicts irreparable harm on its victims,\" the letter to Google reads. \"Where digital advertiser networks like Google place advertisements on websites that are known to host such activity, they have, in effect, created a funding stream that perpetuates criminal operations and irreparable harm to our children.\"\nWhile a few images of child abuse on a single website have alarmed many both inside and outside the industry, they also provide a glimpse of some of the wider problems afflicting the inscrutable world of digital advertising. Most people who use the internet will be familiar with the clamour of digital ads fighting for their attention. They are the product of a system so vast and complex that even the companies who run it don't always know where their money is going. For years, critics have warned that the tech industry will unwittingly line the pockets of bad actors across the web without serious regulatory oversight. Lawmakers are still catching up.\nMeanwhile, it is relatively easy for anyone to set up a website that can make money from ad networks. \"It doesn't cost much to operate a website that serves a few million images per month,\" Franaszek says.\u00a0\nGoogle, Amazon and Microsoft insist they are committed to fighting online child sexual exploitation and abuse. All three companies say they have now banned ImgBB and its subsidiary site IBB from their advertising systems.\n\"We have zero tolerance when it comes to content\u00a0promoting\u00a0child sexual abuse and exploitation and both of the accounts in question are terminated,\" a Google spokesperson told the BBC. \"Our teams are constantly monitoring Google\u2019s publisher network for this type of content and we refer information to the appropriate authorities.\"\nAds are the fuel that powers the internet.\u00a0The best estimates say\u00a0spending\u00a0on digital advertising reached an all-time high of $694bn (\u00a3559bn) in 2024. The marketing industry brings in untold sums for its clients, and the majority of ads are served on legal, appropriate sites. Sometimes, advertisers have a direct relationship with the platforms that run their adverts and commercials. But most of the time, the process is far more complex.\nAlmost every time you see an ad online, it's the result of a chain of dozens of platforms and services \u2013 some competing, others working together \u2013 in an automated process that plays out in fractions of a second. Advertisers usually don't pick the websites that show their ads. Instead, advertisers pay an \"ad network\" whose business is to find the most suitable audience on the most suitable site.\nAmazon, Google and Microsoft all run ad networks of their own, but Google's are the largest by far. It's so dominant, in fact, that the company is currently fighting allegations of operating an illegal monopoly. Google disputes this and argues it faces steep competition in the digital advertising business.\nThese ad networks have untold millions of websites in their inventories. When a network serves an ad, the website gets paid. But anyone can plug their website into the ad networks and start making money. That means it's up to Google and other tech companies to do their due diligence to ensure they don't run ads on websites that fund criminal enterprises or damage brands' reputations.\nBut research by Adalytics and others suggests Google and the ad tech industry have sent advertising money from clients including US senators and multinational corporations to a long list of questionable websites, in ad campaigns that add up to tens of billions of dollars, and perhaps even more. The list includes websites featuring foreign propaganda, calls for racial violence, extremist political content and pornography, as well as sites based in countries facing US trade sanctions such as Iran, Syria and Russia.\nAccording to Arielle Garcia, chief operating officer at the digital advertising watchdog group Check My Ads, incidents like this expose one of the key problems with digital advertising \u2013 that the systems running these adverts are so impenetrably complicated that it's difficult for anyone to figure out what's actually going on, especially from the outside.\n\"That isn't a mistake, it's intentionally opaque,\" she says. \"The ad tech industry weaponises complexity.\" A growing chorus of advertisers complain that the big players in the ad tech business have been providing them with less and less information, Garcia says, and that lack of transparency makes it hard to detect waste and bad practices.\nA Google spokesperson says the company has strict policies about what type of content can run adverts, and it uses \"cutting edge AI-driven enforcement systems\" as well as teams of human reviewers to enforce those policies at scale. The spokesperson says Google disables ads from running on sites where such content is detected.\nBut examples like those exposed by Adalytics have raised doubts among the companies who pay for the adverts in the first place.\u00a0\n\"We have no idea where our ads are going. No confidence at all,\" says a media executive at a major consumer healthcare company whose ads appeared on ImgBB via Google and Amazon's ad network. The executive asked for anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the matter. \"Amazon and Google are responsible for what sits within their inventory. You would think removing content like this from the supply path would be the number one priority.\"\nA Starbucks spokesperson says the company has a robust approach to ensure that its ads run on sites that align with its social responsibility standards. They say Starbucks ensures that its media partners undergo bi-annual audits. A Unilever spokesperson says the company uses similar guidelines and standards and plans to investigate the report's findings. MasterCard and\u00a0Nestl\u00e9 did not respond to requests for comment.\n\"We regret that this occurred and have swiftly taken action to block these websites from\u00a0showing\u00a0our\u00a0ads,\" an Amazon spokesperson says. \"We have strict policies in place against serving ads on content of this\u00a0nature,\u00a0and we are taking additional steps to help ensure this does not happen in the future.\u201d A Microsoft spokesperson says the company doesn't allow advertising on content that violates its policies, which includes user-generated content that is not sufficiently regulated or moderated. The company says it takes immediate action when it detects violations.\nGoogle, Amazon and Microsoft are not the only companies that served ads on ImgBB. Adalytics found ad networks run by a list of other, smaller companies that ran ads on the site as well.\nHowever, Google's dominance over the ad industry means it should share an outsized proportion of the blame, says Laura Edelson, a computer science professor who studies the digital economy at Northeastern University in the US.\u00a0\n\"No one is more responsible for this than Google,\" she says. \"Sure, this stuff might be hard to fix. That's why Google gets paid so much money. This is merely an engineering problem \u2013 the kind of problem they solve every day. Google should be held accountable. This is harming our society.\" ImgBB may also be an example of a much larger problem, Edelson says. \"It is very unlikely that there's nothing else like this that's [able to] monetise in the same way.\"\nAd industry insiders and child safety experts say a site like ImgBB should have been blocked from advertising systems far in advance.\u00a0\nImgBB lets people upload photos anonymously, without creating an account, and provides settings that hide images from search engines \u2013 features that are perfect for criminal activity, experts say. Details about ImgBB's ownership have been scrubbed from public website registries, and that information is absent from the website's terms of service and privacy policy, contrary to standard practices. ImgBB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"Anyone who spent any time looking at this site would have eliminated it [from their ad network inventories],\" says Rob Leathern, a former executive at both Google and Meta who worked on advertising safety issues. \"The mechanics of [ImgBB] mean that a greater level of diligence and care should have been taken by a variety of players in the ecosystem. It's 2025. This is not a new industry. These things shouldn't be getting through.\"\nThis isn't ImgBB's first brush with hosting depictions of sexual abuse. Since 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) sent ImgBB 27 notifications about child sexual abuse material on the platform. That number may be higher, as the 2024 data hasn't been released yet. NCMEC says the website removed the content in every case. \"NCMEC would not qualify this hosting provider as a significant CSAM issue based on this data point alone,\" says John Sheehan, who oversees NCMEC's operations relating to sexual crimes against children. However, \"any platform that allows individuals to anonymously upload images and videos will have a high likelihood for potential for abuse\", he says.\n\"It's a shady platform,\" says Josh Golin, executive director of the children's advocacy group Fairplay. \"This website is clearly designed to facilitate bad things. It's crazy to learn that there are ad placements happening on this website in the first place.\"\u00a0\nAmazon, Google and other ad tech companies could have used any number of methods to root out ImgBB from their inventories, according to Garcia of Check My Ads. Text analysis would have flagged descriptions of adult pornography on a page. Algorithms trained to spot child sex abuse material can identify illegal content. A manual review of ImgBB's features might also have revealed potential risks. Alternatively, Google and other companies could just dedicate an extra layer of diligence to reviewing websites that show up on NCMEC's disclosure reports, Garcia says.\nGoogle and Amazon did not answer questions about whether they use any of these specific methods to vet the websites in their systems.\nIt's no surprise that sites like ImgBB are slipping through, according to Matt Stoller, who's written extensively about the tech industry in his role as director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, which opposes corporate monopolies. The more resources ad networks spend making sure adverts only end up next to reputable content, the lower their margins will be, he says.\nStoller doesn't mince words. \"We shouldn't be asking about how we prevent this. We should be asking who is going to be held accountable. We're not just looking at an ad tech system, we're looking at a crime scene. The way to fix this is handcuffs,\" he says. \"Someone at Google should go to jail. Someone at Amazon should go to jail.\"\nIn addition to images of child sexual abuse on ImgBB, Adalytics says it found depictions of bestiality, other potentially illegal material and mountains of graphic adult pornography. Its report documented hundreds of examples of ads for multinational corporations and even the US government running alongside this type of content. The BBC independently verified a sample of Adalytic's findings, and observed ads for Fortune 500 companies running alongside adult pornography on ImgBB. The BBC did not review any child abuse material or other illegal content.\u00a0\nGoogle isn't the only company drawing criticism. The BBC spoke to nearly a dozen marketers and advertising experts. Every one of them pointed to what they see as failings within the \"brand safety\" industry.\nBrand safety is the industry term used to describe keeping ads away from content that can damage a company's reputation. For many advertisers, showing up on a site like ImgBB is the worst-case scenario.\nFor extra assurance, some advertisers hire companies who make brand safety their entire business. The leaders in this industry, DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science (IAS), say they use a host of artificial intelligence tools and other methods to ensure their clients' ads don't show up on the wrong sites. DoubleVerify, for example, says it uses computer vision algorithms and other tools to analyse the images, video, audio and text on a web page. \"This meticulous visual analysis helps ensure that the visual components surrounding your ads are both suitable and consistent with your brand\u2019s message,\" according to DoubleVerify's website.\nHowever, the Adalytics report and other investigations like it suggest these brand safety systems are not working.\u00a0Computer vision software is highly effective at identifying naked bodies, for example, and a simple keyword search would have flagged that the pages spotted by Adalytics contained adult pornography. Yet advertising executives at companies whose ads appeared on ImgBB claimed to the BBC that both DoubleVerify and IAS marked ImgBB as \"100% safe\", including pages full of adult content.\u00a0\n\"If people are putting their trust in these [brand safety] vendors, then they should be reconsidering it, because it clearly isn't working,\" Leathern says.\u00a0\n\u201cIAS has zero tolerance for any illegal activity, and we strongly condemn any conduct related to child sexual abuse material,\u201d an IAS spokesperson says. \u201cWe are reviewing the allegations and remain focused on ensuring media safety for all of our customers.\u201d The company published a blogpost detailing its plans to \"re-assess our classifications for image-hosting sites\".\nA DoubleVerify spokesperson says the company blocked tens of thousands of ads from appearing on ImgBB in the past 30 days. Ad impressions on ImgBB account for only 0.000047% of the total ads they measured during that period, the spokesperson says, and over 80% of those ads were served on the homepage. The company published a blogpost breaking down other criticisms of the report.\nBoth IAS and DoubleVerify did not answer questions on the record about their methodology, or why advertisers saw pages with adult pornography marked as safe.\nOther industries have laws that require the kind of review process that might have flagged ImgBB. The finance and legal industries, among others, have so-called Know Your Customer laws, for example. Banks are required to scrutinise potential clients to ensure they aren't facilitating money laundering, terrorism, or other crimes. No such laws exist for digital advertising. In fact, the industry is almost entirely unregulated in the US and many other parts of the world.\n\"Our experience has been that the tech industry in general has failed to take meaningful action,\" says Jacques Marcoux, director of research and analytics at the Canadian\u00a0Centre for Child Protection. \"For this reason, our organisation, along with many others across the world, have been advocating for government regulation.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok: What happens when a social media app is banned\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0How America's porn wars could change your internet\nAddressing these issues requires a layered approach that involves every stakeholder in the digital supply chain, Marcoux says. Ad networks who onboard websites should engage in much more robust review processes; advertisers should demand accountability to ensure their ads don't appear next to harmful or illegal content; and the payment processors who handle transactions and compensation along the ad tech chain should apply more rigorous conditions and Know Your Customer practices as well, Marcoux says.\n\"We are not going to fix this problem without better regulation and actual, real, serious consequences for delivering ads that fund horrific companies and activities,\" Edelson says. \"It's too profitable to just ignore this. It's going to be impossible to solve without changing those incentives.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "He's an expert on all of NOLA's iconic foods but has a special place in his heart for gumbo. Here are his favourite bowls \u2013 from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine \u2013 unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\u00a0\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of\u00a0Acadian\u00a0descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\u00a0\nThe SpeciaList\nEmeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a\u00a0YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of\u00a0opinions on the\u00a0right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game \u2013 or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra \u2013 a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse \u2013 famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live \u00a0\u2013 has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo \u2013 served over rice \u2013 Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant, Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit\u00a0since\u00a0the space first opened in 1990. \"It used to be made with seafood,\" he says, \"then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.\"\nIt's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the\u00a0presentation\u00a0has too. \"The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,\" he says, \"that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux.\" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.\nHere are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.\nCommander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.\nPo'boys\nPo'boys (sometimes also written \"poor boy\") are one of NOLA's classic sandwiches \u2013 meats or seafood stuffed into crisp, light French bread. Lagasse's favourite? The po'boys at Domilise's. Inside the little yellow house on Annunciation Street, customers can choose from a whole menu of classic po'boys,\u00a0but Lagasse's top picks are fried shrimp, fried oysters or roast beef. \"You need about 20 napkins to eat the roast beef po-boy. It's soaked in gravy on NOLA-style French bread,\" he says. \"People debate whether to get it dressed\u00a0or not. I go for the dressed\u00a0po'boy, with\u00a0lettuce, tomato and pickles.\"\nIn the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct\u00a0blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of \"haute Creole cuisine\", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo.\u00a0\nEven though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. \"Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,\" he says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.commanderspalace.com/\nAddress: 1403 Washington Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: +1 504-899-8221\nInstagram: @commanderspalace\nCaf\u00e9 Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.\nLagasse's Insider Tips\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde\u00a0in the French Quarter is iconic but crawling with tourists; locals get their hot sugar-dusted beignets at Caf\u00e9\u00a0du Monde's other location on\u00a0Dreyfous Drive\u00a0instead.\u00a0\nAnd for Lagasse, NOLA's best fried chicken comes from\u00a0Popeye's Chicken, the international fast food chain, founded in New Orleans in 1972. \"I don't know why, it's the same formula. But I think NOLA has the best Popeye's fried chicken, no matter which one you go to.\"\u00a0\nWhile most of the hundreds of interns who have been through the 14-week programme go on to work in restaurants, others become nurses, mechanics, technicians and more. What's consistent is that they all learn to cook classic New Orleans fare like red beans and rice, po'boys and gumbo. \"Caf\u00e9 Reconcile's chicken and sausage gumbo has a rich roux with lots of okra,\" says Lagasse, \"and it always hits the spot.\" It's a win-win, according to Lagasse. \"Your meal helps support the workforce development,\" he says. \"What could be better?\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://cafereconcile.org/\nAddress: 1631 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70113\nPhone: +1 504-568-1157\nInstagram:\u00a0@cafereconcile\nKnown as the Queen of Creole cuisine, chef Leah Chase was the heart behind legendary Dooky Chase Restaurant, first opened\u00a0in 1941 by\u00a0her in-laws and later evolving into a meeting place for excellent food, music and dialogue.\nJambalaya\nWhen Lagasse craves jambalaya \u2013 a rice dish cooked with a variety of proteins \u2013 he goes to one of two places for what he defines as the best: \"one that's not too dry and not too wet.\" The first is Toups' Meatery where the jambalaya is prepared with chicken and smoky andouille sausage. He also likes the jambalaya at Dooky Chase, which includes three kinds of pork, such as smoked ham, smoked chorizo and sausage. \"In the city of New Orleans, jambalaya is primarily made in a Creole style, so you'll often find tomato in it, but out in the country there's no tomato\".\nIn the upstairs dining room, many influential leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr and the Reverend\u00a0A L Davis, met to discuss crucial issues affecting the African American community.\nStarting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday),\u00a0Chase would\u00a0cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens.\u00a0\"They do a traditional style of gumbo,\" explains Lagasse, \"but during Lent it has lots of greens \u2013 mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens\u00a0and okra, and it's finished with gumbo fil\u00e9.\"\u00a0\u00a0For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted\u00a0New Orleanians from all over the city.\u00a0Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar \"Dook\" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition. Some say it is the best in New\u00a0Orleans.\nWebsite: https://www.dookychaserestaurants.com/\nAddress: 2301 Orleans Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119\nPhone: +1 504-821-0600\nInstagram: @dookychaserestaurant\nFamily-owned since 1919, Casamento's on Magazine Street is primarily known for its briny Gulf Coast oysters, which peak during cool autumn and winter months. \"Locals love to go there whenever they see the open sign, which is only when the oysters are great,\" says Lagasse. He enjoys eating the plump oysters alongside their much-loved seafood gumbo, which is replete with shrimp, tomatoes and okra. Other Casamento's must-haves include their oyster stew and sandwiches, made with their signature \"pan bread\" instead of traditional French bread.\nWebsite: https://casamentosrestaurant.com/\nAddress: 4330 Magazine Street, New Orleans, LA 70115\nPhone: +1 504-895-9761\nInstagram: @casamentosrestaurant\nChef Frank Brigtsen also started his culinary career as an apprentice under Paul Prudhomme, who helped him and his wife Marna open\u00a0Brigtsen's\u00a0in 1986 in NOLA's Riverbend\u00a0neighbourhood, where he serves classic\u00a0Cajun-Creole cuisine.\u00a0\n\"Frank is an excellent cook,\" says Lagasse, \"and I really like his fil\u00e9 gumbo, which is Cajun-style, meaning it has no tomatoes.\" Cajun gumbo also doesn't include okra. Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with fil\u00e9 powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. \"The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,\" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour. This cuts the cooking time significantly and yields a deep, complex flavour.\u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://brigtsens.com/\nAddress: 723 Dante Street, New Orleans, LA 70118\nPhone: +1 504-861-7610\nInstagram:\u00a0@frankbrigtsen\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The Treble to the periphery - what's going on with Jack Grealish?\nJack Grealish is at a crossroads.\nThe joint most expensive British footballer ever, Grealish should be looking forward to Manchester City's mouth-watering Champions League play-off round match with Real Madrid on Tuesday.\nBut, if recent experience is any guide, he is likely to be on the bench.\nLast month, the 29-year-old was a sub as Pep Guardiola's men trailed at half-time in their must-win final first-phase game against Club Brugge. But instead of his \u00a3100m man, Guardiola turned to relatively untested Brazilian Savinho - a \u00a330.8m signing from Girona last summer - to lead the salvage operation.\nGrealish did not feature for a single minute.\nGuardiola was not even asked about it afterwards because none of the reporters present were surprised.\nHow did we get here? What has gone wrong for the England international? And is there a way back for him at City?\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone\nJust over a month before the Brugge game, Guardiola delivered a straightforward public message to Grealish, challenging him to prove he deserved to regain his spot and explaining why Savinho was being chosen ahead of him.\n\"Savinho is in better shape and everything than Jack, and that's why I played Savinho,\" he said. \"Do I want the Jack that won the Treble? Yeah I want it, but I try to be honest with myself about that. They have to fight.\n\"You can say it's unfair. If you think that, it's fine, but you have to prove [to me], 'OK, I'm going to fight with Savinho, to deserve to play in that position', every single day, every single week and every single month.\"\nDespite such criticism, Grealish subsequently managed his first goal in more than a year against Salford City in the FA Cup.\nAnd then against PSG he scored for the first time in the Champions League since 2021.\nBut those statistics merely underlined the inescapable sense of drift - and Grealish did not feature again until the FA Cup fourth-round tie at League One Leyton Orient on Saturday.\nGrealish created the 79th-minute winner for Kevin de Bruyne, and afterwards his manager seemed impressed.\n\"Jack is a fighter,\" said Guardiola. \"He didn't play the last games... but the season is still open... against Orient I saw the glimpse that he is going to rebel, to show the manager how wrong he is. I love that.\"\nThat was only the fourth time since October Grealish had featured for a full game however, and he hinted at the toll his struggles at City had taken, reflecting on \"probably the most difficult year of my life for many reasons, on and off the pitch\". \n\"I found it really difficult,\" he added. \"But it's a new year, a sort of fresh start, and hopefully I can kick on from here... \n\"I do find it difficult at times to come in and out of games, not really playing. Hopefully I can keep training well and playing a few more games.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'He's put in a really good performance' Shearer on Grealish\nSome of those close to Grealish emphasise it is not just him that has endured a difficult season - the same can be said for the whole team. They feel Grealish has lost out in Guardiola's desperate search for solutions to the worst period of his managerial career.\nKevin de Bruyne, it has been pointed out, has also been repeatedly overlooked. They also say it is wrong to compare the man who shone for Aston Villa with the current version at City because he has been used very differently.\nIndeed, one referred BBC Sport to the recent comments of former England winger Theo Walcott, who last month said: \"I see a player who has incredible talent that's been absolutely coached out of him. I just feel he's gone away from his strengths. Everything that is Jack Grealish has been trained out of him.\"\nOthers disagree the manager has in some way drilled the creativity out of his player.\n\"He's just got to get on with it,\" says ex-Villa manager Tim Sherwood, who gave a teenage Grealish his first league start 10 years ago, and still speaks regularly to him.\n\"It happens to everyone. He gets into pretty much every other Premier League team. I've no idea what Pep's issue is, but he owes a lot to Pep.\n\"He wants to play, but he knows what to do. He's just got to keep working hard. He'll bounce back, he's a good pro. He's never been 'first choice'. I'm not sure who is at City.\"\nGrealish's struggles to get into City's starting side are nothing new. At the end of last season he admitted his 2023-24 campaign had been \"stop-start\".\n\"We have so many good players here so it's difficult,\" he added. \"There's no team in the world that rotates like this team do, but that's the beauty of it.\"\nBut Guardiola still seems unsure what to make of Grealish, or even where to play him.\nAs recently as early December, the manager praised his performance after playing him in a central role against Nottingham Forest - the one game in a chronic 13-match spell they did win - and even joked he may have made a mistake by previously using him as a winger. \nYet, just a month later, Guardiola publicly suggested the player's standards had slipped, leading to rumours Grealish could leave during the January transfer window.\nThat did not happen, but the arrivals of another forward in Omar Marmoush and central midfielder Nico Gonzalez, plus Oscar Bobb's return to fitness, bring even more competition.\nThis video can not be played\nGuardiola: Jack Grealish must prove he deserves his spot\nSo when did Grealish's fall down the pecking order really begin?\nJust 20 months ago he had been at the centre of City's finest hour, playing every minute of their Champions League final triumph over Inter Milan in Istanbul. He had also played virtually all of the magnificent 4-0 semi-final victory over Real Madrid, and the FA Cup final win against Manchester United.\nGrealish then became the face of City's Treble festivities. His drinking and lack of sleep received much of the attention, and he admitted he had reported \"a bit hungover\" for England duty. \nIt all reinforced the sense of enjoyment, authenticity and openness that has endeared him to fans and team-mates, evoking memories of Paul Gascoigne's flamboyance. But it also risked raising concerns with his coaches.\n\"There is a line,\" said England manager Gareth Southgate, when asked whether it was excessive of Grealish to party for three days - in what many interpreted as a subtle warning to keep the revelry in check.\n\"I don't think it is a party-boy thing,\" Grealish said, when asked whether criticisms over the celebrations had bothered him. \n\"I would never sit here and lie to you and say 'yeah, I don't drink and I don't party' because I do\u2026 I just enjoy myself, I'm living my dream of playing for the best club in the world in my opinion. I knew [what] I was doing, that's just the way I am, I'm like that when I party usually.\"\nBack in 2021, Grealish and Phil Foden were warned over their conduct by Guardiola after the pair were pictured on a night out following a match. Both were then dropped, with the manager saying: \"I pay a lot of attention to behaviour on and off the pitch.\"\nThe following year, however, Guardiola defended a group of his players - including Grealish - when similar images emerged, and there is no evidence he had concerns about the post-Treble celebrations.\nBut what is clear is that was the high point for Grealish. In the 2023-24 season that followed, he made just 10 starts, with three goals and three assists across all competitions. And even after injury issues had cleared up, he was largely overlooked, with Belgium winger Jeremy Doku often preferred.\nGrealish hinted at a post-Treble comedown and, midway through last season, Guardiola suggested the winger needed to improve. \n\"He is the same player, he has the same manager and the way we play has not changed,\" he said. \"It's just the way he has performed. That's the difference.\"\nGrealish certainly seemed more of a free spirit at Aston Villa. Manchester United wanted him, and in 2020, they had a chance, but went for Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek instead. Someone involved at United at the time feels the arrival of Doku in the aftermath of the Champions League triumph might have affected him.\nIt also felt significant that last May, while praising his manager, Grealish admitted: \"I've had times this season that I've struggled off the pitch - I don't mind saying that - and he's been there for me so much.\"\nSome weeks later, he once again referred to personal issues - mentioning injuries, but then adding: \"I also had a lot of, not a lot, but some stuff that happened off the field. Sometimes people from the outside don't see, they just think we just play football and we're these robots but we do have a life off the field as well. And sometimes it's difficult to deal with that.\"\nGrealish was understood to be referring, at least in part, to a robbery at his Cheshire home while some of his family were present and he was away playing in December 2023 - an ordeal he described at the time as a \"traumatic experience\" that left him \"devastated\".\nBut there were further challenges to come. \nGrealish was left \"absolutely heartbroken\" by being left out of Southgate's Euro 2024 squad - a decision he has since made clear he disagreed with. Several people close to the player told BBC Sport its impact on him should not be underestimated.\n\"The treatment that he had from England kicked him sideways, and made a real difference to his confidence,\" said one. \"I know that's had some effect.\"\n\"It hit him like a sledgehammer,\" said another, who has worked closely with Grealish.\n\"He loves playing for England, and when the team is at a major tournament it is inescapable, wherever you are in the world. I know he found that hard.\"\nThis video can not be played\nGrealish 'heartbroken' about not being in England Euro 2024 squad\nGrealish responded to the snub by setting up his own summer training camp using Juventus' facilities, and refused the offer of additional time off. He clearly wanted to hit the ground running - but, while he did well on a pre-season tour in the United States, he was outshone by Norwegian youngster Bobb.\nEngland's interim manager Lee Carsley recalled Grealish - starting him against the Republic of Ireland and Finland in September, then against Finland again the following month, with the City man scoring twice across the three games.\nBut his return to the international fold also frustrated Guardiola, with the coach annoyed England had again selected Grealish in November, despite his struggles with fitness.\n\"I'm always pleased for players to go - when they are fit and they haven't struggled for the past one, two, three or four weeks,\" said Guardiola at the time. \"In 17 days he didn't train once... Jack has had two or three setbacks in terms of injuries and could not get his rhythm.\" Grealish subsequently withdrew.\nIf his confidence has been dented by Guardiola's pointed remarks, he would not be the first at City. Last year, Kalvin Phillips - another England international who struggled to convince his manager, despite costing the club \u00a342m when signed from Leeds in 2022 - admitted he had been hurt by criticism over his weight. \nGuardiola later apologised, but it is clear his intensity and exacting standards can come at a cost.\nAccording to those who know him, Grealish is a popular figure within the dressing room, grateful for what his talent has given him, and a man who does not take himself too seriously. They claim he is also the player most likely to stop and talk to fans on site visits.\nAs his sister Hollie has cerebral palsy, there was something deeply personal about the friendship he struck up with young City fan Finlay Fisher - who also has the condition - that led to him doing a goal celebration in the 2022 World Cup in his honour. It fits with Grealish's description of himself as \"relatable\" in a recent film posted on the City website. \"There's no filter,\" he added.\nThose who knew him at Villa speak about a confident yet humble young man who would take his time with fans and staff at the club, asking about their families and how they were.\nThe humanity he showed belied the popular, trendy and handsome image in the headlines. \"His authenticity came through,\" said one who worked with him.\nShaun Derry, who managed Grealish when he was a 17-year-old on loan at Notts Country in 2013-14, says he \"misses seeing the old Jack\".\nIn League One he made 37 appearances and scored five goals, with Derry witnessing the development of a young talent first hand.\n\"I felt I saw two Jacks really,\" he told BBC Sport. \"One was this real young, immature kid who needed to quickly understand what we was looking to do at Notts County. Of course there was an immature Jack, he was 17.\n\"So it's really easy to understand looking back now, what that looked like, but there was an unbelievable confidence and bravery and individuality on the pitch.\n\"When he's looking back at his career he's going to see an absolute top level one, championships, experiences, international football. People will look back and probably look more fondly at Jack as they do now.\"\nGrealish never pushed to leave Villa, his boyhood club, even after Tottenham circled following the club's relegation in 2016.\nHe stayed to help them return to the Premier League in 2019 and is viewed as being instrumental in Villa's recovery with an unshakeable belief in his talent described as \"infectious\".\n\"He allowed others to feel things were possible,\" said one former Villa employee.\nThis video can not be played\nGuardiola was a 'massive factor' in Grealish joining Man City\nHowever, some close to Grealish also feel Guardiola simply doesn't 'get' the England international. That he has still not worked him out. \nThe worry for Grealish would be if the manager has stopped trying to. And with the coach committed to City for another two seasons after this, the next few weeks will shape whether Grealish is there with him or not.\n\"I think it is pretty simple,\" former Premier League striker Chris Sutton said. \"Jack's a level-headed lad and he knows he needs to prove himself to Pep - he knows he needs to get his head down and play well.\n\"You suspect with what has gone on that he may be surplus to requirements in the summer, but he always seems a decent guy who accepts his situation, and he knows he needs game time to show he has a future with City.\"\nThe year 2024 was notable for Grealish in other ways, becoming a father for the first time when his partner Sasha Attwood gave birth to a daughter in September.\n\"I would have thought that would be good thing, and calmed him down,\" said one friend. \"He's always had lots of friends and activities. But now family and football are his focus.\"\nCommercially, Grealish continues to enjoy great success, on top of the \u00a315 million annual salary he is estimated to earn from City. Last year Kelandan - the image rights company he owns with his father Kevin - filed accounts showing \u00a310.5million in assets,, external an annual increase from \u00a33.4m, after a string of sponsorship deals with the likes of Gucci, Bose, Puma and Hellmann's. \nHowever, a sign of the on-pitch frustration Grealish has felt at times this season came after defeat against his boyhood club at Villa Park in December, when he was known to be upset after being booed and heckled by some of the fans who once adored him.\nGrealish responded by holding up three fingers - believed to be a reference to the number of Premier League titles he has won since joining City.

        "article_text": "Food is life for this meal-obsessed island, especially when you're feeling poorly \u2013 including a spicy soup that soothes flu symptoms and a beloved chocolate drink that brings comfort.\nA few years ago, my girlfriend and I landed in Singapore after a winter holiday in Europe. Coughing, dizzy, our throats rusty and inflamed, we were far from well. But help was at hand. My (future) Singaporean mother-in-law came to the rescue, stocking our fridge with liquid medicine: congee. We spooned the thick, savoury rice porridge down our throats, feeling a little better with every swallow.\u00a0\nWarm and filling but gentle on the stomach, in good times congee is a power dinner in and of itself, and endlessly remixable. You can top it with a runny egg, chopped chives and coriander or neon splashes of garlic-chilli oil, and eat like a king. Or when sick, you can cut the tempting add-ons to a bare minimum and still be left with the soothing starch and heat. No wonder congee and its cousins are a key flu go-to in Singapore, Malaysia, China, South Korea \u2013 almost any place in East Asia where rice is a staple.\nSo strong is this porridge's connection to illness that some people can only stomach it when they're under the weather. Like Yuri Cath, a Japanese Indonesian who recently became a Singaporean citizen. \"I had a negative association with congee for the longest time because I only had it when I was sick,\" she says, echoing a sentiment of many locals. \"So, having it kind of made me feel ill.\" Not for long though, she laughs \u2013 the flavours won her over again, \"and I love congee now\".\nIt's tempting to call congee the king of flu food, but this is Singapore, one of the\u00a0most culinary-obsessed nations on Earth, and competition is fierce. A literal melting pot, the island's official languages are English, Tamil, Malay and Mandarin, representing the many cultures that form its core population. Each brings with it enough comfort dishes to soothe an army.\nWhere to eat yourself well in Singapore\nCongee:\u00a0Variety is the name of the game at\u00a0Mui Kee Congee, where your porridge can come loaded with sliced pork, beef, fish balls or abalone, to name just a few options.\n\nRasam:\u00a0Banana Leaf Apolo\u00a0boasts several locations, including one in the heart of Singapore's Little India. Their menu is extensive, but leave room for this stomach-settling dish.\nTamarind:\u00a0Looking for a food souvenir? Visit\u00a0DriedFoodSG, a multi-generation business brimming with dried goods, including tamarind paste or slices, which can be added to stews for an unmistakable flavour boost.\nBak kut teh:\u00a0Multiple businesses fight for the claim of best bak kut teh on bustling Balestier Road, including\u00a0Kai Juan Eating House\u00a0and the aptly named\u00a0Balestier Bak Kut Teh. The latter is open 24 hours a day.\nMilo:\u00a0Head to\u00a0Toast Box, a local cafe chain with more than 80 outlets famed as a popular pre-work breakfast spot. Order Milo hot or cold with kaya toast (bread with sweet coconut spread) on the side. A sugary but comforting pick-me-up.\nHippocrates would have liked this nation of six million hungry souls. The Ancient Greek thinker and physician, who once said, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,\" could witness his words come alive as a daily habit in Singapore's restaurants, homes and 120\u00a0hawker centres\u00a0boasting 6,000 stalls. Below are just some of the health-giving dishes and ingredients Hippocrates would approve of.\nSingaporean Syazana Izzati has vivid memories of her mother taking care of her when she was a child. Not with prescription pills, but with a long-held Malay practice that uses food as medicine.\n\"Whenever my siblings and I were running a fever, she used to do this thing where she'd wet our foreheads and hair,\" Izzati recalls. \"As we were lying down on bed, with a towel placed on our brow, she'd wet it with tamarind water.\" Why tamarind, or\u00a0asam\u00a0as it's known in Malay? \"Because it has cooling effects,\" she explains, \"and lowers the body temperature.\"\nTraditional Malay Medicine, like many ancient healing methods across Asia, leans deeply on jamu, or herbal and plant-based treatments like Izzati's fever poultice. \"These days, I just rely on painkillers,\" she laughs. But that may change, she says. Should she have children, she'll turn to tamarind on their feverish days \u2013 just like her mother and grandmother before her.\nBut tamarind is too popular to be used as a poultice alone. Some ingredients are so revered they crop up in other healing dishes, from cultures thousands of miles away.\nSome 5% of Singapore's population is made up of people with Indian Tamil heritage, who regularly turn to one of the tastiest flu cures you can fit in a bowl. Colourful but light, rasam, a broth originating in South India, is more than the sum of its parts. Its base consists of spices like pepper, turmeric and cumin along with garlic, onions and tomatoes \u2013 and, yes, tamarind again, in this case acting as a souring agent that gives the broth its addictive tart flavour. As a paper by two Indian medical researchers notes, rasam's ingredients are so therapeutic that the dish constitutes a \"functional food\", whose ingredients provide benefits above and beyond their nutritional value.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda\u00a0noted\u00a0when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation. Troubled by his ailing son's health and waning appetite, an ancient king of Madurai in Tamil Nadu province offered a reward for anyone who could make his child eat. One enterprising chef presented a humble bowl of rasam, which was promptly slurped up by the patient. Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda noted when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation.

Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nToday it remains a popular pick-me-up from the flu and is prized particularly for its decongestant properties. Bak kut teh is often eaten late at night, when the day is cooler. That's because it's considered a \"heaty\" soup in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) due to its herbal make-up. The spectrum of internal \"heatiness\" and \"cooling\" are core concepts within TCM, a popular practice in Singapore. Excessive heatiness, for example, may see the body erupt in a fever, sore throat and irritability, while the inverse can lead to paleness and fatigue. The key is to balance your warm yang energy with yin, its cooler counterpart.\nAce Tan, head chef at the newly opened fine-dining restaurant ASU, is a strong believer in this balance. His childhood was steeped in the ancient health system: Ace would often visit TCM stores run by his aunts and uncles. It spurred a passion in him to understand what ingredients affected the body, and how. \"The practice of consuming specific ingredients during each season is deeply rooted in the Asian philosophy of the five elements,\" Ace says: \"wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements are intricately connected to our body systems. By consuming certain ingredients, we nourish specific body parts, ensuring a continuous cycle of cultivation and overall well-being.\"\nSo how does Ace cool himself down when balance is disrupted? \"I do have a strong affiliation\u00a0towards\u00a0two drinks in particular,\" he says, both commonly drunk as teas: \"chrysanthemum and barley, as they help mitigate the heat of my body system, preventing sore throats and fever.\"\nSometimes, however, you just need comfort above all. That's where Milo comes in, a chocolate drink sold in practically every hawker centre in town. The brand is so beloved that a paper at the National University of Singapore Centre for Governance and Sustainability dryly noted: \"It has even humorously been suggested that Milo flows through the veins of Singaporeans.\"\nThey're not wrong. During the Covid-19 pandemic, ad-hoc medical centres gave thousands of patients a care package with critical necessities such as toothpaste, crackers \u2013 and sachets of Milo powder.\nThough it originated in Australia in the 1930s, Milo became popular in many British colonies in Asia, including Singapore. In a 2019 lecture at the National Museum of Singapore, historian Dr Geoffrey Pakiam explained how, once the island achieved independence in the mid-1960s (first from Britain, and then from the Federation of Malaysia, which it briefly joined), Milo was marketed \"as a national drink\". In 1984, Milo began to be manufactured locally as well, further cementing a homegrown connection with the beverage.\nWhat makes this best-selling drink such a treat for the poorly? In part, it's because Milo is an embedded part of childhood, served at school canteens, birthday parties and picnics. That connection continues as people age or join mandatory National Service (NS). Loong Lim, who served his NS decades ago, shares that \"for a lot of guys, Milo will still bring back memories of the night snack you get in the army, when training ends late.\" Drunk by young Singaporeans drenched in sweat and mud, Milo has revived many a tired soldier, who will likely serve it to their child one day should illness strike. Followed, perhaps, by a soothing bowl of congee.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Anyone confused about Beyonc\u00e9's foray into the country genre has only to visit her home state of Texas to learn about Black Cowboy culture\nAnyone confused about Beyonc\u00e9's 2024\u00a0foray into country music need only visit her home state of Texas to get a clearer understanding of the link between the pop star and the country and western vibe of her album, Cowboy Carter, which won three awards at the 67th Grammy awards in Los Angeles: Best Country Album, Best Country Duo/Group Performance and the long-coveted Best Album of the Year.\u00a0Though Beyonc\u00e9 herself said\u00a0upon the album's release, \"This ain't a country album\u2026 it's a Beyonc\u00e9 album,\" it clearly draws from many sources, including the long history of Black country music and Black cowboy culture.\nTexas \u2013 and the singer's hometown of Houston, in particular \u2013 has long been associated with cowboys. The city, which hosts one of the largest rodeos in the world, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, has undeniable cowboy credentials, as does the African American community in Texas and the greater American West. However, for a long time, the image of the cowboy has largely had a white face.\n\u00a0\nAwards Watch\nCowboy Carter is Beyonc\u00e9's eighth album, and her three wins at the 2025 Grammy Awards bring her career total Grammys to 35, breaking the previous record \u2013 which she also held. The award for Best Country Album was presented to the multi-hyphenate by Taylor Swift.\n\"I think that there are these narratives about what America is, and that's always been coded as white,\" said\u00a0Francesca Royster, a professor of English and Critical Ethnic Studies at DePaul University and the author of the book\u00a0Black Country Music: Listening for Revolutions. \"The cowboy has been this heroic image to justify\u00a0Western expansion, and it just seems necessary to make that figure white, even though there were always Black cowboys.\"\nMany people are not aware of how deep cowboy culture runs in the Black community, both historically and today. Beginning in the early 1800s, one out of every four cowboys was Black and horsemanship was an important part of many African American communities well into the 1950s. Even rodeo steer wrestling, known as \"bulldogging\", a technique where a bull is wrestled to the ground using its horns for leverage, was invented by a Black cowboy named Bill Pickett. He was the first African American man to be inducted into the National Rodeo Hall of Fame.\n\"I hope it will change things.\" Royster said, referring to how Beyonc\u00e9's dive into the country genre. \"Thinking about Beyonc\u00e9's Instagram post where she talked about feeling unwelcome in country music spaces. As someone who's been studying Black country music, that to me was a familiar refrain. But I really feel like things are moving fast in terms of changing the culture around country music for diverse listeners and audiences as well as performers.\"\nIn recent years other musicians from Lil Nas X to Blanco Brown have delved into the genre, and their successes have served to highlight the work of musicians like banjo player Rhiannon Giddens and singer-songwriter Brittany Spencer, who have been playing with the genre for years, and are featured on Cowboy Carter. And now, the Texas Hold 'Em singer, who at the album's debut made history as the only Black woman to be at the top of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, is the latest to carry the torch forward.\n\"There's a welcome home happening, and it's for everyone,\" said actor and Black cowboy Brandon Alexander, about the new visibility of Black country music and cowboy culture. \"Whether you get on a horse or you wear the boots or you don't, this is a welcome home. This is a reconnection. This is a, 'we're not forgotten'. This is a 'we helped to shape America, we helped to shape the West'. It wasn't just the John Waynes and the Clint Eastwoods. They were there, but we were also there. So don't forget our stories.\"\nThe best way to honour these stories is to learn about them first hand on a visit to Texas. Here are some ways to experience the history and present-day of the state's Black cowboy culture that led, at least in part, to the creation of Cowboy Carter.\nEvery year since 1957, the Prairie View Trail Riders Association, named for the historically Black college Prairie View A&M University, have done a trail ride from Hempstead, Texas, to Houston to attend the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. This ride, which visitors can view from Memorial Park in Houston, serves to raise awareness of both the history and the continued existence of Black cowboys and cowgirls. The rodeo itself also hosts a Black Heritage Day every year.\nJust outside of Houston, in nearby Rosenburg, Texas, historian and cowboy Larry Callies started the Black Cowboy Museum in 2017 to uncover and preserve the important but little-known history of Black cowboys. In addition to the historical exhibitions available there, the museum also offers opportunities for those interested in continuing cowboy traditions by offering bull-riding classes and hosting an annual Hall of Fame ceremony to honour those Black cowboys still making history in the saddle today.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The forgotten story of the US\u2019 black cowboys\n\u2022 The black cowboys of Chicago's South Side\n\u2022 The Kentucky Derby's forgotten Black past\nThere are also plenty of opportunities to use these skills, or just view them, at Black rodeos in Texas and across the country, including the Texas Black Invitational Rodeo in Dallas, put on by the city's African American Museum, and the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, which travels across the country and is now celebrating its 40th year.\nAlexander emphasized the welcoming nature of Black rodeos for anyone visiting for the first time: \"If you haven't been [to a rodeo], get your boots, get your hat, get whoever you want to go [with] and head out. Sing in unison with everybody when they play a song that we all know, go grab yourself something nice to drink. You will hear some of the most amazing stories from complete strangers.\"\nThis article was originally published on 4 April 2024 and has been updated to reflect Beyonc\u00e9's 2025 Grammy wins.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\n\u00a0Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Abraham Lincoln's wife was long attacked for everything from her spending to her lack of emotional restraint. But with two new plays about her, she is finally getting better press.\nDuring last month's US presidential inauguration, as ever during these quadrennial celebrations, fierce interest focused on the First Lady. Much was made of Melania Trump's dresses, her enigmatic smiles, and especially the navy-blue wide-brimmed boater-style hat \u00a0she wore for the swearing-in. Was the hat a deliberate choice, to shield her face from the prying eyes of the public? No one could say, but legions speculated.\nHow unenviable is the lot of the President's wife, lacking in formal power but constantly judged \u2013 expected to be immaculately turned out, and to remain, in conduct, ever above reproach. The court of public opinion has found no First Lady more wanting than Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of Abraham Lincoln. Her husband, who emancipated the slaves, and saved the union, enjoys near-universal adulation, while Mrs Lincoln has been the subject of criticism and disapproval since her first days in Washington in 1861 when she embarked on plans for a lavish redecoration of the White House. She travelled to New York for a shopping spree, and reporters followed her everywhere. One for The New York Herald wrote: \"Mrs Lincoln, who has been engaged since her arrival in making large purchases at some of the leading merchants, was out yesterday enjoying herself in the usual way.\" \u00a0\nSuch reports did not go down well in the besieged, wartime capital. Indeed, the loyalty of the First Lady, who hailed from a slave-holding family, and had three half-brothers in the Confederate Army, was questioned throughout the Civil War. Even after her husband was shot on 14 April 1865 by Confederate supporter John Wilkes Booth, as he sat beside her in Ford's Theater, the public didn\u2019t embrace their hero's widow. In 1875, her own son had her committed to an insane asylum.\u00a0\nAnd yet today, in the era of TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook, where social esteem rises and falls capriciously on clicks and likes, the maligned Mary Todd Lincoln is getting some compassionate reassessment on the stage, most particularly in Mrs President, a new play by US historian, writer and artist John Ransom Phillips opening this week at London's Charing Cross Theatre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis two-hander centres on the relationship between Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Miriam Grace Edwards), and Mathew Brady, considered the father of American photo-journalism (Sam Jenkins-Shaw) who took iconic pictures of Abraham Lincoln, his family, and the battlefields of the bloody US Civil War. The new play imagines the First Lady, coming to Brady\u2019s studio to sit for her portrait, aware that she is an object of suspicion because of her southern heritage, and seeking an \"image that will define history\u2019s view of me\". Brady declares he has the power to do that. \"I shape the image of people who shape America. Past. Present. Future,\" he says. \u00a0\nIn Ransom Phillips' depiction, Mrs Lincoln demands to be addressed as Mrs President, and engages in an on-going verbal tug of war with Brady over how she should be portrayed. The play asks who controls the revelatory public image, the subject or the artist? This question transcends time and place, but has specific resonance for the former First Lady who sought, and believed she never received, proper recognition during her life for all she had done, and suffered. Later scenes follow Mrs Lincoln into her widowhood, and other controversial historical figures of mid-19th-Century America \u2013 abolitionist John Brown, Chief Justice Roger Taney, and naturalist John James Audubon \u2013 appear on stage, depicted by Jenkins-Shaw. Mrs President is a daringly kaleidoscopic look at the ownership of self.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn truth, Mary Todd Lincoln and Mathew Brady's relationship was a limited one. She did pose for Brady at his studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in November of 1861. When she saw the photographs, she was unhappy with how she looked and instructed that they all be destroyed, except for one she deemed \"passable\", in which she stands, and her face is seen in profile; Brady ignored this request and kept all the photographs in his archives. And later in Lincoln's term, she returned to the studio a few times, but it's not known if Brady took any other of her portraits, as he deputised much studio work to his assistants.\u00a0\nRansom Philips tells the BBC his aim with the play wasn't to document history but rather \"to rescue Mary Todd Lincoln from ridicule and caricature, and to show her as fully a person, a woman of complexity and depth of feeling \u2013\u00a0possessing the kind of emotionality that men often lack\". And his view of Brady is not totally benign. \"Brady is an artist, like I am, and I know artists can be tyrannous.\"\nIn a wildly different way, another theatre production currently running in New York is also sympathetic to the 16th First Lady. Oh, Mary! has been a huge word-of-mouth hit since it first premiered at the city's\u00a0Lucille Lortel Theatre in February 2024, before transferring to Broadway in the summer. This comedy, written by Cole Escola and described by The New York Times as \"gleefully tasteless\" and an \"unhinged historical fantasia\", depicts Mary as a lascivious, self-centered alcoholic who yearns to escape the White House and her nasty, neglectful husband so as to become a cabaret star. Until Escola turned over the role to Betty Gilpin last month, they themselves starred as Mary \u2013 in drag, shaking a mop-like wig of black barrel curls. All joking aside, and Oh, Mary! has numerous slapstick moments, the play's inspiration was Escola\u2019s own sense of identification with Mary \u2013 a woman who could be \"too much\" and was \"trapped in this role she was wrong for\", as Escola explained in an interview on NPR last year.\u00a0\nPerhaps unintentionally, Escola and Phillips have joined a century-long debate among historians over how Mary Lincoln should best be understood. Was she an energetic, ambitious young woman who recognised genius in Lincoln, a rough-hewn country lawyer, and propelled him to greatness? Or was she a volatile wife who made Lincoln's domestic life a living hell, hurling accusations \u00ad\u2013 and on occasion crockery \u2013 at him during regular fits of rage? Was she first unhinged by grief in 1850, when she lost her son Eddie at age three to tuberculosis? Or was it the loss of a second son, Willy, 12 years later, that really drove her mental health decline? Did she take bribes and pad expense accounts as First Lady? Or did she act as a valuable helpmeet, giving President Lincoln sage advice?\n\"In the public imagination she's multiple people \u2013 it all depends on who is examining her,\" historian Jason Emerson tells the BBC. Author of seven books on the Lincoln family, including The Madness of Mary Lincoln, Emerson is currently assembling a complete volume of the former First Lady's letters for the Lincoln Studies Center of the University of Illinois. \"Mary was a complex person, very human, and she made mistakes, as Lincoln did too. She is essentially a tragic figure.\"\nLoss haunted Mary's life starting at the age of six, when her mother died. After Mary's father remarried and sired nine children with his new wife, love was a scant commodity in the family home in Lexington, Kentucky. Mary escaped to Springfield, Illinois, where she lived with her elder sister. Vivacious in conversation and praised, too, for her pretty face and milky complexion, young Mary had many admirers. She found in Lincoln a man who shared her passion for poetry, theatre and Whig politics, and who was also nearly 10 years older and more than a foot taller. But rather than provide her with the steady paternal affection she missed out on as a child, Lincoln was often away from home, working as a lawyer on the Illinois judicial circuit. As introverted as his wife was extroverted, Lincoln struggled to respond to her emotional pleas for attention and sympathy.\n\"Temperamentally they were very different,\" Emerson says. \"And as she aged, her mental problems got worse, consistent with bi-polar issues.\" Emerson's study of Mary Lincoln and her extended family has convinced him that she suffered from the condition formerly known as manic depressive disorder, not widely diagnosed in the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe stresses on both Lincolns during their time in wartime Washington were immense, and Mary was determined to dress fashionably and entertain lavishly. \"She thought of herself as the Queen of America, doing what she was supposed to do as First Lady\" says Emerson. \"Her narcissism was perhaps her greatest vulnerability.\" But when their son Willie succumbed to typhoid in 1862, she refused to get out of bed for weeks and grieved so copiously her husband rebuked her.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What do these First Lady portraits reveal?\n\u2022 The Abraham Lincoln portrait that was a fake\n\u2022 The 17th-Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait\nPerhaps it was inevitable that this often unrestrained woman, would continue to get bad press after her death in 1882. William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, reinforced the most unflattering views of Mary Lincoln, in the biography he co-wrote in 1889 titled Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life. Herndon and Mary despised each other during Lincoln's lifetime and competed for his attention. In private Herndon called her a \"she-wolf\".\nFor many decades, Herndon's interpretation stood \u2013 Mary Todd Lincoln was regarded as a harridan married to a saint. But in the 1980s and 1990s, when scholars began to seriously reassess the role of women in history, the troubled First Lady got a fresh look. In 1987, Jean Baker, a historian at Maryland's Goucher College published Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, portraying the Lincoln marriage as fundamentally tolerant and loving, and Mary as a vital, behind-the-scenes participant in her husband's political career, consoling, advising and encouraging.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat view in turn, was contradicted by renowned Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame in his 2021 book An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. Burlingame believes Lincoln was made miserable by his wife, who, he believes, at times physically abused him, and posits she seduced Lincoln to force him to marry her \u2013 they were wed on a day's notice, their first child born a scant nine months later. And Burlingame is certain, based on evidence in US government archives, that she solicited bribes and sold permits and pardons while in the White House. Yet, the author credits Mary with fuelling Lincoln\u2019s rise. \"If he hadn't married a woman who was so ambitious and so willing to prod her husband and to goad him... he may not have gone as far as he did,\" the historian said in a recent interview for the History Unplugged podcast. Moreover, Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with difficult people, a gift constantly on display during his Presidency, had been honed by plenty of practice at home, in Burlingame's view.\nAuthor, too, of the definitive Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (2009) Burlingame was among numerous experts consulted by director Steven Spielberg for his 2012 hit film, Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the president and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The film portrays the First Lady in a generally positive light, and husband and wife as closely bonded. And yet Burlingame realised that Spielberg and scriptwriter Tony Kushner had closely studied his biography \u2013 which included his hypothesis about the hasty Lincoln wedding \u2013 when Day-Lewis (as Lincoln) and Field (as Mary Lincoln) argue over their eldest son Robert joining the army. He's in favour, she's opposed, and Mary accuses her husband of never liking the boy. \"You've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief,\" she says. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast.\nBut even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. And it's one of the pleasures of the play Mrs President to see the heroine put up a fight for her own identity, and ignore the often harsh and deprecating judgements rained down upon her both before and after her death.\nMrs President is at Charing Cross Theatre, London until March 16. Oh Mary! is booking at the Lyceum Theatre, New York until 28 June.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "These tiny soldiers can eat four times their own weight in organic waste \u2013 and turn it into sustainable fertiliser.\nWith a unique ability to consume nearly any form of organic matter it comes across, one small but mighty insect is becoming a tool to address the growing problem of organic waste and soil degradation. The bug, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), transforms food waste into nutrient-rich biofertiliser: frass.\nInsects have been long been used in agricultural practices as a food source \u2013 but now farmers are exploring the potential of bug poo as a sustainable fertiliser. With over 33% of the world's soil currently degraded, depleted of the nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth, frass can play a major role in restoring soil biodiversity and quality.\u00a0\nIn May 2024, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded grants to three projects that seek to harness this soldier fly's capabilities. This included Chapul Farms, an Oregon-based project development company that's reweaving insects back into American agriculture to eliminate food waste, restore soil health, and produce high-quality animal feed.\nBacked by the Fertilizer Production and Expansion Program (FPEP), the bipartisan support of the use of insects in agriculture highlights the growing recognition of BSFL's potential \u2013 for both waste reduction and for enhancing soil health through the production of high quality domestic fertiliser.\nBut despite the bug's seeming superpowers, the widespread application of BSFL remains limited. The question is: why? And how can companies like Chapul Farms, now equipped with federal support, change that?\nBSFL can consume nearly any kind of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. Facilities like Chapul Farms utilise its voracious appetite to process large quantities of waste, with the larvae consuming up to\u00a0four times their own body waste in organic matter everyday. This happens in a fraction of the time required for traditional composting, which can take up to 10 months. The larvae's efficiency allows for a rapid turnover of organic material into nutrient-rich excrement \u2013 or frass.\n\"They can reproduce pretty quickly too,\" says Shankar Ganapathi Shanmugam, Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University. \"And it [BSFL] grows on dead and decaying material, which means that it can survive on waste.\"\nShanmugam is spearheading research on the use of frass as a crop nutrient, which until now has not been studied in the US \u2013 though it has been studied in other parts of the world, notably in multiple countries across\u00a0Europe.\nChapul collaborates with neighbouring farms to exchange waste for frass, creating a circular system. It's a mutually beneficial exchange as the farms receive nutrient-rich soil amendment and Chapul receives the fuel for their operation. And it's doing something significant for insect populations too: helping to repopulate them.\nThis is because insect farming operations create a controlled environment for the bugs to thrive. The frass created from them\u00a0provides essential nutrients\u00a0to plants and fosters a more biodiverse soil, which encourages the growth of native plant and insect species, thus supporting the overall ecosystem.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"We could make compost out of anything but the impact of running it through this insect biology has all of these [positive] implications,\" says Mimi Casteel, an Oregon wine farmer who has been using Chapul's frass. \"It's exciting for so many reasons: it's a portable, pretty low cost investment compared to some other things that we're considering as part of dealing with our massive problems with waste, and soldier flies are replacing a missing layer of diversity.\"\nChapul has worked with local vineyards, researchers and farms to research, educate and promote frass benefits and adoption in the bioregion. TAINABLE, a local soil restoration non-profit, provides laboratory space and farmland to Chapul for their research.\nAs organic waste production continues to place a massive burden on energy and carbon emissions, there is an increasing need for more efficient and sustainable processing methods. And BSFL's digestive processes can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"Finding a use for this is important, but if you're going to market frass as a fertiliser, you need to regulate it, which takes time,\" says Shanmugam. \"And to make these regulations you need research.\"\nThe US National Organic Program does not include insects as an acceptable additive as of now. This makes it a challenge to share this technique with farmers who use organic practices, though teams like Chapul Farms are in conversations with regulators to increase education around it and usher in its inclusion.\nUnlike chemical fertilisers, which often deplete soil over time, frass promotes biodiversity within the soil by introducing a diverse microbial community. This boosts soil resilience, natural plant defence, improves its ability to retain water, and reduces the need for costly synthetic inputs. In sharp contrast, synthetics can wreck soil biodiversity, beneficial bacteria and the soil's natural micro-ecosystem, leaving it dependent on increasingly expensive inputs. They also have intensive fossil-fuel requirements, and reduce soil's carbon carrying capacity.\n\"We recently saw even more of a push for our government to get projects funded that support domestic fertiliser production,\" says Aly Moore, Chief Communications Officer of Chapul Farms. \"We realise how many health issues are caused by the reduced nutrient density in crops, and all the pesticides used. And on the cost factor, farmers will not only need less fertiliser over time, but also fewer pesticides.\"\nThis can all contribute to cost savings and be more incentive for farmers, especially at a time when fertiliser prices are sky high and supply is unreliable. Prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. With the US being the world's third-largest fertiliser importer, American farmers felt the brunt of this impact; making it not just a fertiliser issue, but also one of food security.\n\"In the two years leading up to 2023, there was an 8% reduction in global fertiliser consumption, because people were priced out of the market,\" says Michael Place, Chief Technology Officer at Chapul Farms. \"There were supply disruptions and even unavailability. And FPEP emerged from this sort of emergency.\"\nSoil microbes present an exciting frontier for regenerating soil health, yet less than 1% of total microbes in soil have been cultivated. Frass provides an opportunity to pivot from the reductionist methods of treating soils that perpetuated the soil crisis in the first place, all while bolstering food and agricultural security.\nFarmers will eventually need less frass to maintain the same levels of soil productivity, as the microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health and resiliency by improving biodiversity.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 A 2,000-year-old method to water crops\n\u2022 The ignored potential of human poo\nFarmers who have begun using frass in their fields are already reporting promising results.\u00a0Casteel is in the midst of facilitating trials to assess the impact of frass on her crops. While the statistical outcome of the study is still in progress, she has already witnessed perceptible changes.\n\"Anecdotally, what I can tell you is that in the trials that I've done both with grapevines and in my vegetable farm, the produce itself comes up faster, it has better cellular structure,\" says Casteel. \"So if you actually cut the leaf and put it under the microscope, the cells grow more densely and they have figure lipid membranes. And what that means is that the plant from day one has more structural integrity,\" she says.\nThe FPEP funds will support construction and equipment for BSFL facilities located in Oregon and North Dakota. The projects anticipate yielding 10,000 tons of frass per location per year and will generate 59 new jobs, upon its opening which is expected to be in 2026.\u00a0\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the nascent insect agriculture industry is the tunnel vision around insects for protein production which has overshadowed the benefits of frass in soil health. While protein from BSFL is a lucrative and fast-growing market, frass remains an underutilised resource in insect agriculture.\nThe global insect protein market was valued at nearly $1 billion in 2022 (\u00a3805m), while global frass was valued at $96 million (\u00a377m) in 2023, and frass's projected growth is substantially higher. Plus, according to the Chapul Farms team, insect farms produce twice as much frass as larvae.\u00a0\n\"I think farmers have historically been convinced that insects are problems, and they just don't want to talk about adding more problems to their situation,\" says Casteel. \"But when our farms become more complex, you start to see an exponential rollout of ecological returns.\"\u00a0\nIn addition, insects are keystone species, meaning entire ecosystems would drastically change or collapse without them \u2013 and our world would \"grind to a halt\", as the biologist Dave Goulson\u00a0wrote in the Guardian newspaper.\u00a0\n\"Ultimately, at its core, we cannot survive without insects,\" says Pat Crowley, CEO of Chapul Farms. \"Natural ecosystems cannot flourish... without the insects as a part of them. And that's one of our biggest premises. It's not as simple as: insects will solve the biggest trends in global agricultural health. And at the same time, I think it's one of the biggest levers that we have in making agriculture a more resilient, ecosystem-based model.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The UK is not prepared to tackle the impacts of climate change, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) has warned, as it called on the government to take \"urgent action\" to ensure the country is protected.\nIt said fire and rescue teams \"play a crucial role\" in responding to increasingly common extreme weather events such as wildfires and flooding, \"often over prolonged periods of time\", causing a strain on their \"business as usual\" services.\nFire chiefs also warned that limited resources and access to longer-term forecasting data created challenges in how the sector prepared for extreme weather.\nThe Met Office said 2024 was the fourth warmest on record, and has previously predicted climate change would cause summers to be up to 60% drier and winters to be warmer and wetter.\n\"It is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities,\" NFCC chairman Mark Hardingham said.\nGlobal average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to data from the Copernicus climate service.\nIn the past year, parts of the UK have been hit by bouts of severe weather, most recently Storm \u00c9owyn which brought rare red Met Office weather warnings and widespread disruption in the worst impacted areas. Storm Darragh also brought similar red warnings in December.\nThe UK's summer was the coolest since 2015, driven by a south-shifted jet stream that brought northerly winds carrying Arctic air, though many areas still saw spells of temperatures up to 34C.\nMr Hardingham said: \"Watching the devastation caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles and the number of recent flooding incidents we have seen in the UK, it is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities in the future.\"\nHe added that fire crews were \"on the frontline\" in responding to extreme weather and \"repeatedly\" went \"above and beyond to protect their communities\".\nThe UK recorded temperatures of over 40C (104F) for the first time in 2022 - a heatwave that leading scientists said would have been \"almost impossible\" without human-induced climate change. \nIt saw several fire services tackle wildfires on parched parts of land including in South Yorkshire, Norfolk, Surrey, Kent and London. Some services declared major incidents.\nRail services were also cancelled in some areas after tracks overheated or buckled.\nThe NFCC is seeing the \"risks around extreme weather increasing\", Mr Hardingham said, adding that without \"adequate investment\" and government action, its \"capacity to keep communities safe and protect infrastructure is at risk\".\nThe NFCC urged the government to review the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which details how the government prepares and plans for emergencies, and also to ensure there are data analysis mechanisms in place that provide an assessment of the risk and impact of incidents linked to climate change.\nThe UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning it takes as much of the gases out of the atmosphere as it puts in.\nIt has made a series of pledges to reach this target, including achieving so-called 'clean' electricity by 2030 through rapidly increasing wind and solar generation, and investing in technology to capture and store carbon dioxide.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in November 2024 that the country would aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "summary": "\"It is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities,\" NFCC chairman Mark Hardingham said.Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to data from the Copernicus climate service.In the past year, parts of the UK have been hit by bouts of severe weather, most recently Storm \u00c9owyn which brought rare red Met Office weather warnings and widespread disruption in the worst impacted areas. UK unprepared for climate change impacts - fire chiefs council3 February 2025Hollie ColeBBC NewsGetty ImagesThe UK is not prepared to tackle the impacts of climate change, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) has warned, as it called on the government to take \"urgent action\" to ensure the country is protected.It said fire and rescue teams \"play a crucial role\" in responding to increasingly common extreme weather events such as wildfires and flooding, \"often over prolonged periods of time\", causing a strain on their \"business as usual\" services.Fire chiefs also warned that limited resources and access to longer-term forecasting data created challenges in how the sector prepared for extreme weather.The Met Office said 2024 was the fourth warmest on record, and has previously predicted climate change would cause summers to be up to 60% drier and winters to be warmer and wetter. Storm Darragh also brought similar red warnings in December.The UK's summer was the coolest since 2015, driven by a south-shifted jet stream that brought northerly winds carrying Arctic air, though many areas still saw spells of temperatures up to 34C.Mr Hardingham said: \"Watching the devastation caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles and the number of recent flooding incidents we have seen in the UK, it is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities in the future. Some services declared major incidents.Rail services were also cancelled in some areas after tracks overheated or buckled.The NFCC is seeing the \"risks around extreme weather increasing\", Mr Hardingham said, adding that without \"adequate investment\" and government action, its \"capacity to keep communities safe and protect infrastructure is at risk\".A simple guide to climate changeWhat you can do to reduce carbon emissionsFour ways climate change worsens extreme weatherNorthamptonshire Search and RescueSome episodes of intense rainfall and wildfires have been driven by climate changeThe NFCC urged the government to review the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which details how the government prepares and plans for emergencies, and also to ensure there are data analysis mechanisms in place that provide an assessment of the risk and impact of incidents linked to climate change.The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning it takes as much of the gases out of the atmosphere as it puts in.It has made a series of pledges to reach this target, including achieving so-called 'clean' electricity by 2030 through rapidly increasing wind and solar generation, and investing in technology to capture and store carbon dioxide.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in November 2024 that the country would aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035.Could the UK actually get colder with global warming?A year of extreme weather that challenged billionsSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week. \"He added that fire crews were \"on the frontline\" in responding to extreme weather and \"repeatedly\" went \"above and beyond to protect their communities\".The UK recorded temperatures of over 40C (104F) for the first time in 2022 - a heatwave that leading scientists said would have been \"almost impossible\" without human-induced climate change.",

        "article_text": "This ancient snack is synonymous with Tibetan New Year and will soon be prepared by millions of families.\nAt the entrance of the Kemgun Gumba monastery in Lukla, Nepal, an indigo-blue sign reads \"dining\". Inside, nearly a dozen women and a few men are hard at work, hunched over long tables, deftly mixing, rolling and slicing dough into thin rectangular strips. Each strip is slit in the middle, and one side of the dough is pulled into a ribbon-like bow. The rhythmic pounding of dough punctuates the crackle of oil sizzling in a large vessel outside, as boys and girls transform the doughy strips into deep-fried khapse (kha zas\u00a0in Tibetan), a sweet, crunchy snack central to Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists.\n\"Kha means 'mouth', and sey means 'snack',\" said chef Yeshi Jampa, co-author of the book Taste Tibet and founder of the eponymous Taste Tibet restaurant in Oxford. \"It's a symbol of [Tibetan] New Year,\" or Losar, he added.\nEvery year, millions of Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, India and elsewhere celebrate Losar (lo\u00a0means \"year\" and\u00a0gsar means \"new\"). The 15-day festival (which starts 28 February 2025) occurs on the first day of the Tibetan Lunar calendar and celebrates renewal and new beginnings. The first three days of the festival are considered the most important when followers visit monasteries, offer ceremonial scarves, receive blessings from Rinpoches (respected Tibetan teachers or lamas) and prepare special dishes with friends and family \u2013 especially khapse.\nEating khapse on Losar is thought to bring warmth, peace and tranquillity in the new year, and preparing it is both an art and a labour-intensive process. The dough (made of wheat flour, butter, sugar and oil with an optional egg) is kneaded, rolled and shaped into designs like flowers, knots and braids before being and fried in ghee (clarified butter).\nAccording to Geshema Delek Dolma, a nun at Dolma Ling Nunnery in northern India's Himachal Pradesh state, the history of khapse is intertwined with early Bon rituals \u2013 the indigenous religion practised across the Tibetan plateau before the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th Century CE \u2013 where blood offerings were made to deities.\n\"[Instead] of animal sacrifice, the custom evolved into offering khapse, which was sometimes coloured red as a symbolic gesture,\" Dolma said. \"The practice eventually spread to the other two provinces [Amdo and Kham] of\u00a0Tibet.\"\nKhapse-making is a communal activity.Itrequires many hands to prepare the honey-golden pastries in large quantities so it can be distributed to friends, family and across the community. So in the days ahead of Losar, family members come together to prepare large batches of khapse.\n\"It depends on how much quantity [of khapse] you have to make,\" said Kanchhi Maya Sherpa, who runs the Hotel Sherwi Hyul in Kathmandu. \"It's impossible for one [or] two people to make it as we need to knead the mixture together for a long time. Working together in the Gumba [monastery] is community work.\"\nFollowers first offer khapse to the deities as part of their religious practice, and afterwards, the crunchy treat is shared with others, including the poor, as a means of charity. \"This is always the tradition because Tibetans believe in the service of others before self,\" said Jampa.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Chhurpi: The world's hardest cheese?\n\u2022 The world's higest train line\n\u2022 After 100 hours in Tibet, I knew it was time to leave\nAs Jamyang Norbu, author of the book Echoes From Forgotten Mountains, notes on his blog, the first piece of khapse isn't actually eaten or offered. Instead, it's customary to shape the dough in a scorpion-shaped cookie, fry it and then place it outside the kitchen until \"the 15th day of the New Year to ward off bad luck and possible accidents that could take place during the [khapse]-making\".\n\"Traditionally, it was believed that making khapse could predict success for the upcoming year,\" explained Dolma. For example, oil spilling during the frying process was considered a bad omen. Jampa recalled an accident from his childhood that ruined his family's New Year celebrations. \"[It meant] evil,\" he said, noting how preparing the snack is steeped in cultural beliefs.\nKhapse recipes and the shapes the snack takes vary across regions and families. In Tibet's Markam County, where Jampa grew up, khapse was traditionally sweetened with organic honey from their beehives instead of sugar. Khapse made with honey \"makes the biscuit a little softer\", he explained. \"The sweetness of honey-made khapse arrives more slowly.\" In contrast, recipes that call for sugar have a crunchier texture.\n\"Different parts of Tibet mould khapse differently [and] in different shapes,\" Jampa said. \"I am from Kham. In my village, we make less ornate\u00a0khapse, known as\u00a0kong-chen \u2013 a narrow rectangular piece of dough with a cut in the middle through which one side of the\u00a0khapse\u00a0is pulled through.\" Another style, the hrug-hrug, \"are basically just small rectangles or triangles of dough that require no further work\", Jampa explained.\nKhapse is also deeply connected to Buddhist rituals. During Losar, flowers, fruits, grains, nuts, salt, butter and water are placed on the altar, as offerings to deities, alongside stacks of khapse arranged in towers called derga.\n\"Derga khapses are different shapes, compared to the khapses that we eat,\" my Tibetan friend, Tenzin Diki, told me. \"We add khapse in the shape of a crescent moon and a sun on the derga. We also add beautiful kharu (smaller, ornately designed pieces of khapse) on the derga, and decorate it with chhurpi [traditional cheese], sweets [and] rock sugar.\"\nToday, these fried cookies have evolved in style and shape and are eaten throughout the year. Khapse is sold year-round at stores in Kathmandu and many families prepare it as a snack outside of Losar. A quick online search for \"khapse\" or \"khapsey\" shows legions of home chefs and food bloggers experimenting with moulding the cookies and preparing them with additional ingredients like banana, beetroot, spinach and more.\n\"These days, people have modernised khapse, using their creativity, adding motifs to shape it differently,\" Sherpa explained. \"The shapes now depend on how much creativity one has. You can make it in any shape you want.\"\nYet, not everyone embraces these innovations. \"We have to keep traditional things traditional,\" said Jampa. \"[Khapse] is a special ceremony snack, a symbol of family effort and [it] reminds us that it is something special.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "From Nubian Markets to the National Center for Afro-American Artists, a local tour guide offers his picks for the best places to see Boston's Black culture\nBoston is a city of neighbourhoods, and if you wander off the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail that passes through 16 significant sites in US history, you'll find extraordinary stories tucked in every nook and corner. Getting visitors to explore the city's varied cultural districts has long been a goal of Collin Knight, who founded Live Like a Local Tours in 2019. As a native of Roxbury, the neighbourhood that's the beating heart of Boston's Black community, he's working to highlight the city's rich African American culture while also acknowledging Boston's history of racial tensions.\u00a0\nThough Boston is perhaps most famous for its strong Irish roots, the city's Black history runs deep. Prior to the US Civil War, Boston was one of the most important stops on the Underground Railroad. The first chartered branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People civil rights organisation was founded here in 1911. Malcolm X moved to Boston 30 years later, followed by Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who considered the city his \"second home\" and fell in love with his would-be wife, Coretta Scott King, here. Today, 25 percent of Boston's population is Black \u2013 twice the percentage of the Black population in the US.\u00a0\n\"When we look at downtown, the city's Eurocentric history is being glorified each and every day. They're not really talking about Native Americans and African Americans and their plight within this country and Boston's connection to slavery,\" Knight says. \"I'm trying to figure out how we can tell the whole history of Massachusetts in the city of Boston instead of just telling one part.\"\u00a0\nHere are Knight's suggestions of the five best places in Boston to experience the city's vibrant modern-day Black culture, as well as the ties to its past.\n1.\u00a0The National Center for Afro-American Artists\u00a0\n\"The National Center for Afro-American Artists (NCAAA) houses art from some of the most prominent African American artists that have lived in the Boston area or are from the Boston area. A lot of people don't know much about it,\" Knight says. \"Dr Barry Gaither has been the curator of that museum since 1968. It was created by Dr Elma Lewis, who was the grande dame of the arts within the Boston area for many years. She was very well known for providing arts and culture to young people of colour within Boston, and Roxbury specifically.\"\u00a0\nKnight's must-see experiences within the museum include seeing the narrative paintings of Roxbury legend Allan Crite, known as the \"Dean of African American artists\" in New England, thanks to his nearly 90-year career. Another highlight, says Knight, is the ASPELTA exhibit displaying artefacts from Nubia. The exhibit features scores of 2,600-year-old objects recovered by archaeologists from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard University, including a fully-accurate recreation of the interior of a Nubian tomb. \"It's pretty incredible,\" Knight says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://ncaaa.org/\nAddress: 300 Walnut Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-442-8614\nFacebook:@themuseum_ncaaa\n\n2. Nubian Markets\u00a0\nThis sprawling new grocery store, halal butcher shop and fast-casual cafe, which opened in Roxbury in spring 2023, celebrates the food of the African diaspora. Its shelves are stocked with hard-to-find produce and vegetable items, and more than 30 Black-owned brands. \"It's absolutely incredible when you think about it: the halal approach, the restaurant/supermarket approach and the fact that it's a Black-owned supermarket in the middle of Roxbury,\" Knight says, noting that, historically, most grocery stores in the neighbourhood had been white-owned or run by white conglomerates.\u00a0\n\"This is a very powerful thing for us as Black people,\" Knight added. \"It's not something that we've ever had in our own community\u2026 They are focused on supporting other local businesses and other vendors of colour across the country.\"\nCuts of lamb, beef, and goat sold at the shop are raised following Islamic standards to feed the city\u2019s growing Muslim population, and many products on its shelves, sauces and spice mixes, are produced by local artisans like Cameroon native Paulette Ngachoko, founder of Hapi African Gourmet. In the cafe, menu items range from ginger beef and injera bowls to pea fritters and lamb couscous. \"I'm just excited about everything they're doing,\" Knight says.\nWebsite: https://www.nubianmarkets.com/\nAddress: 2565 Washington Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-608-4940\nInstagram: @nubianmarkets\n3. Comfort Kitchen\nThis cosy Black-, immigrant- and woman-owned restaurant opened in January 2023 in Dorchester's Uphams Corner neighbourhood. It was nearly a decade in the making and comes with its own dose of history: it's housed inside a 1912-built building that is on the National Register of Historic Places.\u00a0\n\"I love the owners over there. You think about the vibe that's in there, you think about the menu and how it's connected to the African diaspora,\" Knight says. \"[The building] was a comfort station [public restroom] for people travelling from the Dorchester area to the South Shore.\"\u00a0\nInside the former bathroom, the chic 30-seat space has curved pale-pink banquettes that are an Instagram favourite. Cocktails feature Equiano, an Afro-Caribbean rum produced in Mauritius and Barbados, or pay tribute to Black engineering pioneer Lewis Latimer, who worked alongside Alexander Graham Bell to develop the telephone in Boston in the 1880s. (Non-alcoholic drinks include a take on Tootsie, a Ghanaian fermented beer or a baobab mocktail.) For dinner, munch on jackfruit sliders, jerk roasted duck or za'atar brown butter trout.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.comfortkitchenbos.com/\nAddress: 611 Columbia Road, Dorchester\nPhone: 1-617-329-6010\nInstagram: @comfortkitchenbos\n4. Wally's Cafe and Jazz Club\u00a0\nWally's is an institution in Boston's South End neighbourhood, and when founder Joseph Walcott opened the club in 1947, he was the first African American nightclub owner in New England. Walcott got his start by drawing \u2013 and often driving \u2013 musicians up from New York City and created one of the few spaces in Boston during the time of segregation where anyone of any race could mingle. Today his grandchildren run the space, which hosts music 365 nights a year, often drawing from talented students at Berklee School of Music, the New England Conservatory and other nearby institutions. It's considered the oldest jazz club in the city.\u00a0\n\"What most people don't realise is there were jazz joints and juke joints up and down Massachusetts Avenue. That is the last of a dying breed that we had all over [the area] back in the day.\u00a0All of the greats came to play,\" says Knight \u2013 among them Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday. Check the schedule for their funk, jazz, and salsa offerings, which run from 17:00 to 01:00 nightly.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://wallyscafe.com/\nAddress: 427 Massachusetts Ave., South End\nPhone: 1-617-828-1754\nInstagram: @wallyscafejazzclub\n5. The Embrace\u00a0\nThis new, massive bronze sculpture was unveiled on Boston Common this year, celebrating Boston's civil rights legacy and commemorating the period that Dr Martin Luther King Jr lived in Boston. King attended theology school at Boston University in the 1950s and met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who was attending the New England Conservatory of Music, while living in the city.\nThe sculpture, by artist Hank Willis Thomas, is an abstract depiction based on a photo of the couple embracing after King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. It also recognises a moment in April 1965 when the leader stood on the park before a crowd of 22,000 and called for Boston to live up to its ideals and create a more equitable city.\u00a0\nWhile the sculpture alone \"is a really beautiful piece to tell that history, I think, more importantly, if you look at the grounds of The Embrace, you see all of these names [of people who marched alongside King and helped expand his ideas],\" Knight says. \"It's really about all of the local community advocates that have made a difference within the Roxbury community and the Boston community at large. So, I think it's an incredible tribute to Dr Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King, but it's also a tribute to our city as a whole, to talk about the Black histories of our city, of our neighbourhoods, and have it be in the middle of the Boston Common.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.embraceboston.org/memorial\nAddress: Boston Common, 139 Tremont Street\nInstagram: @embracebos\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published on 17 June 2023 and has been updated, including the removal of one business which has since closed, Soleil restaurant.\n---\u00a0\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u00a0called \"The Essential List\".

        "article_text": "From Captain America: Brave New World to Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, these are the films to stream and watch at the cinema this month.\nThere are plenty of films about The Beatles, but Becoming Led Zeppelin is the first ever authorised documentary about the band that took over their mantle as one of the world's biggest and most influential rock groups. An intimate account of the foursome's pre-Zep careers and their early years together, the film is constructed from jovial interviews with the three surviving members, singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones, while a 1971 interview with John Bonham provides the late drummer's perspective. \"It's the personal confidences that stand out\" in this \"fascinating\" film, says Jonathan Romney in Uncut. \"A rich vein of anecdotes is found in Page and Jones's busy history as session players, with Jones particularly emerging as an affable raconteur with a juicy portfolio of anecdotes.\" James Bond trivia alert: as jobbing musicians, both Page and Jones were in Abbey Road Studios when Shirley Bassey recorded the theme song for Goldfinger.\nReleased on 5 February in the UK and Ireland, and on 7 February in the US, Canada, Australian, Spain and Sweden\nArmand is a provocative and weirdly comic Norwegian drama written and directed by Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, the grandson of two Scandinavian film legends, Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann. Renate Reinsve, the star of The Worst Person in the World, plays a famous actress who is summoned to her six-year-old son's school after he has been accused of sexually assaulting a classmate. Ushered into a room with the school's senior teachers and the alleged victim's parents, she is subjected to \"one of the most harrowing PT meetings ever witnessed\", says Jo-Ann Titmarsh in HeyUGuys. And as secret connections and shady agendas emerge, \"there is plenty of violence lurking beneath the surface of this middle-class tale\". The winner of the prize for best first feature film at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Armand is \"troubling, entertaining and at times confounding\".\nReleased on 7 February in the US, on 21 February in Spain, and on 28 February in Turkey\nI'm Still Here is already one of the stand-out successes of this year's awards season, having been nominated for the best picture, best international feature, and best actress Oscars. A Brazilian political thriller directed by Walter Salles (Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries), it tells the true story of Rubens and Eunice Paiva and their children. In 1971, they are living happily by the beach in Rio de Janeiro, but Rubens (Selton Mello), a former congressman, has been campaigning against the military dictatorship. When he is removed from his house by a team of policemen, it is up to his wife (the Oscar-nominated Fernanda Torres) to ask where he has been taken \u2013 and to keep asking, even when all hope seems lost. A longstanding family friend of the Paivas, Salles has made a \"deeply poignant\" drama, says Jessica Kiang in Variety, and his \"deeply invested film-making is remarkable in its grace and naturalism\".\nReleased on 14 February in the US, and on 21 February in the UK, Ireland and Spain\nThe classic Looney Tunes characters have featured in some of the greatest animated short films ever made, but they haven't been in any feature-length cartoons: instead, they've popped up in such animated/ live-action hybrids as Space Jam and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. But now, at last, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig star in their own 91-minute animation, a full nine decades after the characters made their debuts. The idea is that Daffy and Porky (both voiced by Eric Bauza) get a job in a bubblegum factory where they uncover an alien plot to take over the world. \"It's not consistently hilarious but it is consistently imaginative, sometimes even breathtaking,\" says William Bibbiani in The Wrap. \"The animation style evokes favourable comparisons to Max Fleischer and Don Bluth, with jaw-dropping backgrounds and fluid, energetic, expressive movement. It's the prettiest animated movie Warner Bros has released since The Iron Giant.\"\nReleased on 12 February in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and on 28 February in the US and India\nInspired by a Stephen King short story, The Monkey stars Theo James as a pair of twin brothers with a cursed wind-up toy monkey: ever since they were children, the toy has somehow caused people to die in extravagantly gory ways. The film is written and directed by Osgood Perkins, who made last year's creepy horror hit, Longlegs, but he promises that his follow-up is completely different. While Longlegs was infused with a gloomy atmosphere of dread and despair, The Monkey revels in the silliness of its premise. \"It's deliberately comedic,\" Perkins said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's feeling more like an old John Landis movie or a Joe Dante movie or a Robert Zemeckis movie. I saw an opportunity to make a wry, absurdist comedy about death... For me, the movie is a smile from top to bottom.\"\nReleased on 21 February in cinemas internationally\nIt's been 24 years since the first Bridget Jones film, and over eight years since the last one, but Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is back again in the fourth comedy to be based on Helen Fielding's bestselling novels. This time Bridget is a single mother dealing with the death of her husband, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth \u2013 who is due to appear in flashbacks). Leo Woodall (One Day) plays her much-younger love interest, Chiwetel Ejiofor is an eligible teacher at her children's school, and Hugh Grant has a cameo as her dastardly former boss, Daniel Cleaver. But will audiences still warm to the bumbling Bridget? Zellweger believes so. \"I think maybe folks recognise themselves in her and relate to her struggles and feelings of self-doubt,\" she said in British Vogue. \"Bridget is authentically herself and doesn't always get it right, but whatever her imperfections, she remains joyful and optimistic, carries on and triumphs in her own way. She seems to make her quirky individuality and shortcomings charming, lovable and acceptable \u2013 and, in turn, she makes us feel lovable and acceptable, too.\"\nReleased on 12, 13 and 14 February in cinemas internationally, and on 13 February on Peacock in the US\nAs a boy in the 1980s, Ke Huy Quan had major roles in two blockbusters, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Goonies, but acting work dried up soon afterwards. Decades on, he made a stunning comeback in the multiverse-spanning Everything Everywhere All at Once, and even won an Oscar for best supporting actor. Now he has his first ever leading role. Love Hurts is an action comedy in which Quan plays a geeky estate agent with a secret past as a gangland enforcer. The film's mix of gentle humour and nifty martial artistry seems ideal for him, but he wasn't sure whether to take the role until he consulted an old friend. \"I was at an event with Steven Spielberg and he was asking me, \u2018Ke, how are you doing?'\" Quan told Empire magazine. \"I said, 'Steven, I'm not doing so well.' Because of all the love and support that I had gotten during that whole award season, I was so worried that whatever I was going to do next, I would disappoint. I told him about this project and kind of pitched it to him. He said, 'Ke, it's great. Do it.'\"\nReleased on 7 February in cinemas internationally\nNow that Chris Evans is no longer playing Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the question is whether audiences will pay to see someone else wielding the character's patented red, white and blue shield. More specifically, will audiences pay to see Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson, who was Captain America's sidekick in earlier Marvel films, and has now been promoted to the title role? Judging by the trailers and the posters, studio executives seem to be hoping that another character will be the film's big draw. Filling in for the late William Hurt, Harrison Ford co-stars as Thaddeus Ross, a former US Army general \u2013 and arch-enemy of the Hulk \u2013 who has just been elected as US president. He hopes to count on the new Captain America's support, but their negotiations are interrupted when Ross is transformed into a bright red version of The Hulk. \"What we liked was this notion of a man who is trying to do the best he can but can't quite outrun the demons of his past,\" the film's producer, Nate Moore, told Entertainment Weekly. \"Turning a guy who hunted Hulks into a Hulk himself makes him more than an antagonist; it makes him a tragic character.\"\nReleased on 14 February in cinemas internationally\nA genre-mashing horror-romance-action film, The Gorge is directed by Scott Derrickson (Doctor Strange, The Black Phone), and it stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller. The concept, as dreamt up by screenwriter Zach Dean, is that two elite snipers are paid to spend a year in separate concrete observation towers on either side of a remote, misty valley. They have no high-tech means of communicating with each other, but they chat and flirt via flashcards and binoculars. The only obstacle in the way of this burgeoning relationship is that the valley is, apparently, \"the door to hell\", and their job is to stop monsters climbing out of it. The Gorge is a Valentine's Day release, and Teller thinks that it's the perfect film for the occasion, whether or not you're in the mood for love. \"Well, I just think it's good alternative programming, as well, to your typical love story,\" he told Screen Rant. \"They meet each other for the first time, and you're going to watch 'em fall in love. But they have to go through some really entertaining, engaging, high-octane, hellacious shit to end up with each other, so that's cool.\"\nReleased on 14 February on Apple TV+\nChristopher Andrews' debut film as writer-director could be the darkest and most brutal thriller about sheep-farming ever made. At its heart are two dysfunctional families with adjacent fields in the rural west of Ireland. Colm Meaney and Christopher Abbott play a taciturn father and son who are scraping a living on one farm; Barry Keoghan plays the feckless son of a rival couple (Nora-Jane Noone, Paul Ready) just down the road. When one family suspects the other of stealing two rams, the ensuing feud is as believable as anything in a down-to-earth kitchen sink drama, but with the twists and tension of a gangster film. And it could put you off eating lamb forever. \"Although hardly the first film to address toxic masculinity and the scourge of violence in small-town communities, this grimly compelling drama possesses a scruffy integrity,\" says Tim Grierson at Screen Daily. \"In Andrews' vision, rural Ireland is as harsh as the Old West.\"\nReleased on 7 February in the US, UK & Ireland\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "While the formal dress and classic dances of the Vienna balls have prevailed since the early 1800s, some events are taking unique approaches to the tradition.\nSince the early 1800s, locals and visitors have been gathering in the ballrooms of Vienna, Austria, to waltz the night away. Originally organised to entertain distinguished nobles and politicians gathered in the capital after the Congress of Vienna, the annual ball tradition has continued into the present day with thousands of people breaking out their finest clothing and gliding across dancefloors under magnificent chandeliers.\nThe city's ball season starts in November and continues until Shrove Tuesday (4 March 2025), with January and February marking the peak of the season. More than 450 balls take place in Vienna each year. These are typically formal and ceremonial affairs with a strict dress code of ball gowns and tuxedos, where modern accessories like wrist watches are considered a considered a faux pas. However, in recent years, more unique events have cropped up as well, led largely by a younger generation.\n\"There are more modern balls \u2013 young in both their origins and audience \u2013 where the dress codes are more relaxed,\" says Helena Steinhart, PR manager of the Vienna Tourist Board.\nDress Code\nWhile the dress code varies, female attendees are generally expected to wear floor-length evening gowns, while men typically don black tailcoats with a white bow tie and black shoes. For those who don't want to bring their formal attire, there are plenty of rental opportunities available in the city during the season.\nIf you're interested in attending a ball this year, a full list can be found online, with each dance selling tickets or spaces on the waiting list on their own sites.\nOne example is the annual Wiener Hip-hop Ball (15 February 2025). Launched five years ago, this ball is a fascinating blend of old and new, where participants pair traditional formal dress with trainers and dance to hip-hop music rather than the waltz.\nFor an even more relaxed ball experience, visitors can attend the Sweatpants Ball on 1 March. \"The dress code is, quite literally, in the name,\" quipped Steinhart.\u00a0\nMany newer balls have also been launched to create space for communities who might be uncomfortable at some of the more traditional events. The Rainbow Ball, for example, which took place on 25 January, specifically caters to the LGBT community and features a welcoming atmosphere for same-sex dancing couples.\nOther interesting events include the annual Vegan Ball, which includes a vegan gala dinner; and the Comic Con ball, where guests are encouraged to show up in cosplay as their favourite character.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A designer's guide to artisanal shopping in Vienna\n\u2022 What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022 A queer dance champion's guide to experiencing queer tango in Buenos Aires\nTickets for this year's ball season are still available, though some of the larger and more well-known balls, such as the Opera Ball (27 February 2025) are waiting list only. Resale tickets can sometimes be found online, though Steinhart cautions that this option is best for German speakers as there's no formal website to find them. Visitors can also book a tour package that includes a ball experience; or stay at one of several hotels in Vienna that offer ball-themed packages, such as the one at Almanac Palais.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump says that wind farms harm birds and whales. Scientists weigh wind power's impacts on wildlife against those of oil and gas.\nAspen Ellis, a seabird biologist at University of California, Santa Cruz, spent a decade doing field work on remote islands off the coast of the United States. She often lived for months amongst thousands of birds, becoming so immersed in their ways that she even learned to tell which predators were nearby from the birds' calls. But as she added her observations to 40 or 50 years of previous research on these colonies, she noticed a worrying pattern.\n\"Again and again, I just found myself logging the impact of climate change over time,\" she recalls, from rising sea levels that threatened breeding colonies, to fish moving to cooler areas and leaving seabird chicks starving. \"Without addressing this larger issue of climate change, the seabird conversation work we were doing wasn't sufficient to save those populations,\" she adds. She decided to change focus \u2013 and today, studies ways to make clean-energy offshore wind farms safer for birds.\nThe impact of energy production on wildlife has come into the spotlight again amid US President Donald Trump's plan to pivot the country's supply from renewables such as wind, to oil and gas. In his first days in office, Trump revoked former-president Joe Biden's ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling. \"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump promised when he was inaugurated, while putting the brakes on the expansion of wind farms. One of his arguments is that wind farms harm birds and whales. His executive order halting offshore wind farm development cited the importance of marine life as one of the reasons for the decision.\nRenewables beyond the US\nThe US energy policy pivot towards fossil fuels is halting wind power developments for now, even as other nations press ahead with the expansion. China, for example, is home to almost two-thirds of the world's solar and wind power projects in construction.\nAfter China, the UK is the world's next-largest offshore wind market. Scotland's government has described wind power expansion as a \"once in a generation economic opportunity\", with a pipeline of around 40GW of offshore wind capacity in addition to 3GW already in Scottish waters.\nMeanwhile, the fastest-growing renewables sector of any major economy belongs to India. And in almost every country worldwide, wind and solar remain the cheapest way to add new power.\nWhile wind farms can have some adverse effects on local wildlife in the habitats where they are sited, including through noise, Ellis and other scientists specialising in the environmental impact of wind farms challenge the claim that wind power is more damaging to wildlife than fossil fuel extraction. They describe wind energy as a powerful and necessary weapon against climate change, arguing that its impact on wildlife can be understood, managed and reduced. They contrast this with the existential risk posed by fossil fuels driving global warming \u2013 along with the ongoing noise and pollution from oil and gas production.\nThe debate is highlighting one of the most challenging conundrums facing renewable energy projects around the world \u2013 to what degree must they balance the impact they can have on local environments with the global effects of climate change? And how do those wind-power related impacts compare with the local effects of oil and gas drilling?\n\"Fossil fuels, and their effect on climate change, outweigh everything,\" says Beth Scott, a professor in marine ecology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, a nation that has become a wind energy powerhouse. \"Climate change is by far, by far the worst enemy, to all wildlife, and humans.\" Speaking from Aberdeen, she points to her window, at a brewing storm due to batter Scotland later in the day. It's too soon to say if this particular storm has been made stronger by climate change, but the overall picture is clear \u2013 extreme weather is \"only going to get worse\" in a warmer world, she says.\nScott and her colleagues are studying the impact of wind power on the marine ecosystem. While that impact exists \u2013 more on it later \u2013 she also describes wind power especially useful tool in the switch to renewable, climate-friendly energy because it can be built quickly and at scale.\n\"Once you start construction, in less than two years, you can build a 2GW [offshore wind] farm \u2013 the equivalent of a nuclear plant,\" Scott says. Nuclear power plants can take over a decade to construct. \"So, in terms of rapid response to climate change, there's that.\"\nEllis also sees wind power as especially promising. \"There is a lot of consensus [among seabird experts] on the need to move from traditional energy sources to a renewable energy framework, and offshore wind has a really big potential to do that,\" she says. \"We're seeing the industry really boom very quickly, there's a lot of interest in that internationally, there's a lot of capacity for it internationally.\"\nWind farms, both on land and in the sea, do pose a risk to birds, however, including habitat loss and collisions with the turbine or their blades. In Scotland, for example, the northern gannet and the black-legged kittiwake are considered at high risk of collision with wind farms.\u00a0\nSeabirds may also suffer indirect effects, for example if they change their routes to avoid wind farms, and then spend more time and energy finding food. How much seabirds avoid wind farms, and how this affects them, may vary significantly and is still subject to ongoing research. Some, such as the red-throated diver, have been reported to avoid wind farms, while others, such as large gulls, have a mixed response to them, research suggests. Others again, such as cormorants, seek out wind farms to forage and roost there. (Read more about how wind farms can be made safer for birds.)\nIn Scotland, Scott and other scientists are conducting wide-ranging research on the impact of wind farms on the whole food web, including on plankton, using ocean robots and other instruments. Wind power does alter the ecosystem, Scott says, but the impact is not necessarily always negative. Research tracking seals suggests that they now use wind farms as hunting grounds to forage for fish gathering around the turbines, for example, with one seal's tracks showing how the animal made its way through the farm and stopped at different turbines to snack.\nDecades of research from around the world suggests that oil production affects birds, whales and other wildlife in many different ways. Apart from the climate factor, there is the risk of oil spills as well as smaller, chronic leaks, scientists say, which can harm seabirds, whales, dolphins and other wildlife. Dolphins exposed to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for example, suffered health problems including chronic lung disease and abnormal hearts, research has shown.\nKaitlin Frasier, an associate research scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego, and other researchers have studied how the unprecedentedly large and deep offshore oil spill has impacted different whale and dolphin species in the long term. They used acoustic sensors to record the clicks emitted by the animals, and from that, estimated their population density in the area. They found that a decade after the spill, seven of eight monitored species groups had declined, including sperm whales (by up to 31%) and beaked whales (up to 83%).\nBut the sensors also picked up on something else, which you can listen to in the recording below: deafening blasts from oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\"[The Gulf of Mexico] is a really noisy area because of all of the surveys that are associated with drilling, they do these seismic surveys that generate a whole lot of noise as they are looking for the oil pockets and understanding how the oil is moving,\" says Frasier.\nThe noise from oil and gas is largely from seismic surveys deploying airguns, which are towed behind ships and blast compressed air through the water every 10 seconds, Frasier says. \"They're doing this in deep water, 1,000m (3,280ft) or more, and it's really low frequencies, so theses sound waves travel really far in deep water,\" she says. The sound is so powerful that \"you can hear it all the way across the Gulf of Mexico\".\n\"So, they're surveying off of Texas, you'll hear it off of Florida, you'll hear it in Mexican waters. There's no way to escape that sound,\" she says.\nFor whales, dolphins and other marine mammals that rely on sound and echolocation to find their food in dark and murky water, such loud and sudden underwater noise can be deeply disorienting, equivalent to being blinded, as well as being very distressing for them, research has shown.\n\"If you think about a sperm whale, one of the species in our study, a third of the body of the animal is a sound-production device. That's how important sound is to the animal. Their whole life is centred around the use of sound,\" says Frasier.\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, the noise from the airguns as well as vessels may be making it harder for whales and dolphins to forage for food, Frasier suggests. The oil and gas industry, however, maintains that there is no evidence that airgun noise injures or harms marine life, an assertion that environmental groups dispute.\n\"It's not that we think those sounds are directly killing whales, but those whales use sound in their daily life to find food, to communicate with each other,\" Frasier says. \"Imagine if a light was being blasted into your face every 10 seconds \u2013 that would be disruptive as you're trying to go about your day.\"\u00a0\nWind farm construction also involves noise, for example during surveying but also when the pile is hammered into the seabed. Studies have shown that seals and harbour porpoises are affected by the noise from pile-driving, causing them to flee for several miles and affecting their ability to feed.\nBut Frasier highlights that with oil and gas, the surveys happen over a longer time period, not just before but also during extraction.\n\"We see it in all of our recordings,\" she says of the oil-related noise, which she describes as a constant backdrop to the whale sounds. \"It's very heart-wrenching to listen to.\"\nBy comparison, evidence from European offshore wind farms suggests that loud noise from wind farm construction tends to be more temporary and containable, as it happens during the pile-driving phase. In Europe, some countries such as Germany now legally oblige offshore wind farm developers to place devices called bubble curtains around the construction sites to buffer such pile-driving noise, and protect porpoises and other marine animals. (Read about how bubble curtains work, and their effect on wind farm noise).\nOnce the wind farm is in place, it can keep spinning for decades and then be replaced with new turbines on the same land, whereas oil production moves on once one site is exhausted. There is, however, also ongoing noise in offshore wind farms from the spinning turbines and the supply and maintenance vessels. Ship noise \u2013 whether from such maintenance vessels, or shipping generally \u2013 can in turn affect marine mammals such as harbour porpoises.\nLiba Pejchar, a professor and conservation biologist at Colorado State University, and her team have compared the effects of inland wind energy and oil and gas on ecosystems in Colorado and neighbouring Wyoming. These states are home to wind farms, as well as oil and gas fields. One of the aspects they studied was habitat loss and fragmentation, meaning, wildlife habitat being lost or broken up through roads as well as the turbines or oil and gas fields themselves.\nThey found that both onshore wind farms and oil and gas production, caused habitat loss. However, \"we found overall that wind energy resulted in less habitat fragmentation than oil and gas and especially, less impacts over the long term\", she says. \"In the near term, the impacts were often somewhat equivalent, but wind energy is a renewable resource, so once you put in the turbines, they continue to harness that energy for decades to come. Whereas oil and gas have to keep moving, and so those impacts just getting compounded across the landscape.\"\nWhile wind power hazards for birds, such as collisions, are well-known, preliminary research by Pejchar's team suggests oil and gas production can also negatively affect birds and their habitat, and for example, have impacted ferruginous hawks in Wyoming.\nLike the other scientists, Pejchar also highlights how climate change, driven by fossil fuels, is already changing the environment. \"There's a higher frequency of these large, catastrophic fires in Colorado in particular,\" she says. \"Sometimes wildlife can benefit from fire, it's a natural form of disturbance, but the scale of these fires and the intensity and frequency \u2013 there could be complete state changes, where forests can no longer be sustained because fire is moving through them on such a regular basis. So that's going to have a huge impact on wildlife communities.\"\nBoth industries are taking steps to reduce the effect their activities have on the local environments where they operate.\nIn a 2022 study co-led by Ellis, an international group of scientists and also conservation organisations such as American Bird Conservancy developed a process that allows wind farm developers to identify and minimise the risks to seabirds. They recommended measures to reduce or offset the impact that included choosing sites that are less in the way of seabirds' known flight routes or habitats; wind farm developers building alternative nesting sites; and developers funding conservation programmes to boost the species in other habitats.\u00a0\n\"Seabirds are a great case study for this [process], because we have a lot of data about many of these species,\" Ellis says. In addition, \"seabird conservation is very well understood\", she says, both in terms of specific threats to seabirds, such as predators and invasive plants, and also in terms of how to effectively address those threats, for example by removing predators such as rats, and clearing invasive plants. The assessment process outlined in the study could then also be used to reduce the impact of wind power on other species, such as bats and whales, with measures that are appropriate for them, she says.\nRegarding the environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction, some of the most important measures have aimed at reducing oil spills and chronic oil pollution, which can be catastrophic for birds and other wildlife. Monitoring of beached, oiled birds in Europe's North Sea has revealed a sharp decline in the rate of oiled birds, suggesting a decrease in oil pollution and spills as a result of measures such as requiring oil tankers to have double hulls.\nBut the attempts to lessen the local effects of energy infrastructure do little to address the wider context of climate change, the threat of which has led to international agreements to phase down fossil fuels. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are leading many parts of the world to feel the effects of global warming.\nAnd these are beginning to affect the environments where fossil fuels are extracted too. The Gulf of Mexico, for example, has been in the grip of a climate-change-fuelled marine heatwave, which can make hurricanes more intense.\nAlongside the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels, the intensity of extracting the oil in the Gulf of Mexico has an additional climate impact from the release of large quantities of methane \u2013 an even more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over a 20 year period.\nAlthough the global supply of renewable power is surging, and demand for oil, gas and coal are all predicted to peak this decade, the race to build energy infrastructure that doesn't harm wildlife looks set to be a challenge for years to come.\nHow the energy industry responds will be felt in habitats around the world.\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Here are her local insider picks, from shopping on Hollywood Road to hiking Dragon's Back.\nThe very name Hong Kong immediately conjures up luxury boutiques, wild nightlife, street food and spectacular architecture. We asked Hong Kong-based Hollywood actress and model Angelababy (Yeung Wing) to help us get to the heart of this dynamic place with so much to offer.\nThe SpeciaList\nChinese actress Angela Yang Ying, better known by her stage name Angelababy, moved to Hong Kong with her family at the age of 13 where she launched a meteoric modelling and film career. She went on to star in Mojin: The Lost Legend film, which, was on its release the highest-grossing Chinese-language IMAX film in China, and has starred in several Hollywood blockbusters. In 2016, she was named one of Forbes 30 Under 30.\nThe mega-famous actress and model \u2013 known for starring in the Chinese gameshow\u00a0Running Man\u00a0as well as various high-profile action films \u2013 has lived here since the age of 13, when her father's job brought the family from their native Shanghai.\n\"When I first arrived in Hong Kong, I was impressed by its skyline and harbour views,\" reminisces Angelababy. \"It's a very dynamic city. I felt that living here would be fun.\"\nThe future model soon found her new home was an exciting blend of cultures as well as modern and traditional architecture. \"Hong Kong is a real mix of East and West,\" explains Angelababy, about the former British colony. \"This is particularly evident in street names, most of which are directly translated from English and sound quite interesting.\"\nHong Kong's cultural celebrations include epic festivities like Lunar New Year in January when Victoria Harbour's sky is lit up with fireworks, the centuries old\u00a0Cheung Chau Bun Festival in May when competitors scramble up a tower of steamed buns filled with lotus paste and the thrilling Victoria Harbour river races of the Dragon Boat Festival in June. \"It's the culture that makes the city so special,\" says Angelababy.\nHere are Angelababy's favourite ways to explore Hong Kong.\nTo find the real Hong Kong, Angelababy recommends looking no further than a cha chaan teng\u00a0(tea restaurant). \"Tea houses are deeply rooted in Hong Kong's culinary culture. Traditional Hongkongers enjoy going to tea houses for lunch with family or friends.\"\nWhere to watch the Lunar New Year fireworks\nVisitors who want to watch the Lunar New Year fireworks (30 January 2025) in style could try this tip from Angelababy: \"Book a hotel like the Rosewood Hong Kong, The Peninsula Hong Kong or Regent Hong Kong,\" she says. \"At these hotels you can see the view of the fireworks and you can have your own private fireworks show.\"\nLocals and expats alike sit huddled around tables in these old-school cafes, which are decorated with whirling fans and patterned floor tiles. These iconic Hong Kong spots are known for serving European treats with an Asian twist, so expect cups of strong Hong Kong milk tea made with condensed or evaporated milk, flaky egg tarts and pineapple buns with a cracked surface resembling its spiky namesake fruit. \"If you're working on movies in Hong Kong, everybody stops at 15:15 for afternoon tea [and] we'll all enjoy an egg tart or a pineapple bun,\" says Angelababy. The actress has been hoping to try the newly renovated historic tea house Lin Heung Lau; originally established in the 1920s. \"So many friends say it's very good, but because it\u2019s so busy and hard to get a table, I haven't tried it yet,\" she says. \"But I know it will be worth it. You just have to see the videos.\"\nWebsite: https://linheunglau.shop/\nAddress: 160-164 Wellington Street, Central District, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 21160670\nInstagram: @linheunglau/?hl=en\nAnother culinary custom synonymous with Hong Kong culture is dim sum; a traditional Chinese brunch where a dazzling variety of small, savoury bites in bamboo baskets are wheeled through the restaurant on carts, to be shared with the whole table. \"[It's] quality time with family,\" says Angelababy. \"It's not just about filling the stomach; it's an experience.\" Hongkongers tuck into baskets of stewed, roasted or steamed dumplings such as char siu bao (doughy balls of sweet roast pork); siu mai (open-topped steamed dumplings); or soup dumplings filled with richly flavourful broth, which they wash down with tea.\nRide the Ding Ding\nAngelababy said that one of the most fun ways to travel around Hong Kong is on the double-decker tram that has been running since 1904. The super-skinny vintage tram can be found on Hong Kong Island. \"We call it the Ding Ding,\" says Angelababy. The name comes from the sound of the bell ringing twice that lets people know the tram is leaving.\nDim sum, which translates to \"touch the heart\" is believed to have originated in the port city of Ghangzhou and was brought by traders to Hong Kong in the 19th Century. It is now served across the city in five-star hotels and in tea houses. \"Hongkongers have a diverse palate, and dim sum encompasses a wide variety of dishes, perfectly catering to everyone's [tastes],\" says Angelababy. \"I believe the flavours of Hong Kong dim sum are unique; no matter how people from other countries try to imitate them, they seem unable to replicate those tastes.\"\nAngelababy loves to stop for dim sum at Lung Keen Heen in the newly renovated Four Seasons Hong Kong overlooking Victoria Harbour. \"I do prefer a window seat, but I don't mind any seat actually,\" she says. \"As long as I can get a table to dine there, I\u2019ll be happy.\"\u00a0Her picks: baked pineapple buns with barbecued pork and pine nuts along with a seasonal soup.\nWebsite: https://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong\nAddress: 4th floor, Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, 8 Finance Street, Central, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 3196 8882\nInstagram: @fshongkong/?hl=en\nHollywood Road was recently dubbed the second coolest street in the world by Time Out for its long history and constantly changing offerings. This historic street running between the Central and Sheung Wan neighbourhoods is filled with landmarks such as the 19th-Century Taoist Man Mo Temple, Michelin-starred restaurants, antique shops and galleries. Angelababy recommends a visit to G.O.D (Goods of Desire), which has quirky home buys. \"I love to stop at Hong Kong's creative art hub PMQ,\" she says, referencing the seven-storey 1950s former \"Police Married Quarters\", where the police and their families lived. \"There are many local designers' studios and workshops at PMQ. It's a very interesting place for creative exploration. [I\u2019ll visit] PMQ's [Night] Market, which has many small items, vintage goods and snacks.\"\nWebsite: https://www.pmq.org.hk/\nAddress: 35 Aberdeen Street\nPhone: +852 28702335\nInstagram:\u00a0@pmqhkdesign \u00a0\nHong Kong's hilly and mountainous terrain makes it great for outdoor sport. \"If I have visitors in Hong Kong, I will take them hiking,\" says Angelababy. \"That\u2019s one of the special things about Hong Kong. There are not that many cities where you can go hiking in nature in 30 or 40 minutes. You can just [pick up a bottle of] water and go.\"\nAngelababy recommends holidaymakers pull on their hiking shoes and hit Dragon's Back Mountain at Shek O Country\u00a0Park; a curvy mountain trail that overlooks Tai Tam Bay. \"It's not a hard walk and it comes with panoramic views,\" she says.\nDragon\u2019s Back Mountain can be found on the south-eastern corner of Hong Kong Island. The trek begins with a gentle walk that leads hikers through the forest, along the ridge of the mountain to Dragon's Back Viewing Point where people can see Stanley, Tai Tam Bay and Lamma Islands. \"You feel miles away from the city at Dragon\u2019s Back. I feel so relaxed when I'm there,\" says Angelababy. \"I [go] for a walk over Dragon\u2019s Back and then down to the white-sand beach of Big Wave Bay.\"\nWebsite: https://www.discoverhongkong.com/seasia/explore/great-outdoor/dragon-s-back-a-scenic-hike-from-shek-o-to-big-wave-bay.html\nAddress: Shek O Country Park\nPhone: +852 91878641\nInstagram:\u00a0@discoverhongkong\nHong Kong is home to 263 islands, including Lantau Island \u2013 known as \"the lungs of Hong Kong for its great swaths of indigenous forest \u2013 and the idyllic Lamma Island; a popular escape from the chaos of the mainland. Angelababy's Hong Kong island pick is the tranquil island of Tai O.\nHome to the Tanka boat people, Tai O's Venice-like canal is lined with 200-year-old fishermen\u2019s stilt houses. The fishermen on this island are famous for producing the island's salty shrimp paste used to add flavour and umami to many curries and sauces. Visitors can observe the fishermen puttering around the island in colourful sampan boats with their fresh daily catch.\nRecently, film crews have taken a shine to the historic island with its vintage shophouses; one even appeared on the Netflix show Restaurants on the Edge. But Angelababy loves heading to Tai O to see the island\u2019s famous pink dolphins. Despite their name, these beautiful, endangered creatures are actually white, only appearing pink due to the blood vessels that run close to the surface of their skin.\n\"I used to visit the island when I was young,\" she says. \" Now I take my son to see the pink dolphins. Last time, we arrived Tai O at 10:00 and then took a 30-minute boat tour out to sea to look for dolphins. I think you need some luck to see them, but not much. If you\u00a0go there in the good weather, you\u2019ve got a good chance.\"\nWebsite: https://www.discoverhongkong.com\nAddress: Tai O island\nPhone: +852 2508 1234\u00a0\nInstagram: @discoverhongkong\nProud mum Angelababy recommends that visitors check out Hong Kong Disneyland on Lantau Island or Hong Kong\u2019s own Ocean Park. First opened in the 1970s, this zoological theme park with more than 80 attractions has become one of the biggest theme parks in the world. \"It\u2019s really good for families,\" says Angelababy, who also enjoyed visiting as a teenager. \"The park has two parts. It\u2019s so big, you need to take the cable car. You can see Hong Kong\u00a0south\u00a0and [the] mountainside.\"\nFound within the park is a grand aquarium with more than 5,000 fish, as well as golden snub-nosed monkeys, penguins and now six pandas. \"There are two new pandas, and the\u00a0park [has] new born\u00a0[babies] too,\" says Angelababy. The Thai people may have Moo Deng, but the Hong Kongers have new baby pandas for visitors to peek at in February. \u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://www.oceanpark.com.hk/en\nAddress: Aberdeen, Hong Kong\nPhone: +852 3923 2323\nInstagram:\u00a0@khoceanpark\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "After unearthing a rare collection of highly prized Silk Road artefacts, a family in the Himalayas has opened a museum dedicated to one of the fabled route's final traders.\nMuzzamil Hussain was in grade school when the first bombs fell on the playground outside of his classroom in Kargil, a mountain city in the Indian province of Ladakh. While the violent onset of the 1999 Kargil war between Pakistan and India unfolded around him, Hussain and his family escaped south to the remote Suru Valley.\nAfter India claimed victory later that year and displaced families returned home, Hussain listened as his bedridden grandfather asked the family to visit an old property, originally built by Hussain's great-grandfather, near Kargil's bazaar to make sure it had survived the war. When Hussain's uncles cracked through an old rusty latch and peered through the hand-carved wooden doors, they discovered wooden crates stamped with names of cities around the world. Making space on the dusty floor, the family began to lay out silks from China, silver cookware from Afghanistan, rugs from Persia, turquoise from Tibet, saddles from Mongolia and luxury soaps and salves from London, New York and Munich.\u00a0\nThey had found an abandoned treasure trove \u2013 a collection that would soon become recognised as one of the finest family-owned collections of Silk Road artefacts in India and a discovery that would change the course of Hussain's life.\nThat was 25 years ago. Today, centuries after it provided a crucial-yet-harrowing thoroughfare for Silk Road traders, the Himalayan mountain pass of Zoji La connecting Kashmir to Ladakh is still known as one of the most dangerous roads in the world. On a recent visit, my palms began to sweat as our 4x4 groaned its way higher up the mountainside. I glanced nervously out the window towards a glaciated peak at eye level, and the valley floor more than 1,000m below. No matter how close I pressed my nose against the window, I could not find the edge of the dirt road; just air and a long way to fall. In the front passenger seat, Hussain texted one of the many enterprises he runs with his family, including two hotels, two museums, a conservation NGO and a tour guide service. This was a regular commute for him, and one that his family had braved for centuries.\nI first met Hussain in 2023 while searching for snow leopards in eastern Ladakh. While sipping pink Kashmiri noon chai in a snow flurry at 4,265m, he told me stories of his own remarkable connection to the Silk Road. His flashbacks began with war, flirted with buried treasure and ended in reconciliation. As an archaeologist enamored with mountain history, I needed to learn more, so two years later, I found myself on the Zoji La in the footsteps of Silk Road traders who, like us, hoped to make it to the historic trading hub of Kargil before nightfall.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe mountainous region of Ladakh is situated in the westernmost corner of the Himalayas amongst the disputed borders of India, Pakistan and China. Towering peaks, steep glacial valleys and sweeping alpine plateaus dominate the landscape. Fields of barley blanket sandy floodplains; blindingly white apple and apricot blossoms paint the shores along the Indus River; and on the ridges above, snow leopards and Himalayan brown bears move like wraiths as they search for their next meal. Because of its location at the crossroads of commerce and conquest, modern Ladakh is home to a blend of cultures including Tibetan Buddhists, Muslims and a number of tribal communities.\nThe Silk Road refers to one of the world's largest overland trade routes \u2013 a network that spanned 6,400km connecting Europe to far East Asia. Although named for the Chinese silks that the Roman elite imported during the 1st Century AD, the cross-continental trade system was established much earlier. Once constructed, the network helped transport ideas, religions, commodities and currencies across the ancient world. While the connection between Europe and East Asia was severed in 1453 when the Ottomans boycotted China, segments of the Silk Road continued to exist regionally in places like Ladakh well into the 20th Century.\nA few days after our hair-raising crossing of Zoji La, Hussain and I sat at a small cafe in central Kargil eating dal and sipping masala chai. As the Islamic call to prayer echoed around the mountains of the Zanskar Range and wood smoke drifted in from a nearby bakery, Hussain explain why his family decided to protect and share their great-grandfather's treasure.\nSilk Road Kargil\nThe best way to experience Kargil's Silk Road history is to drive there along the ancient route from Leh or Srinagar. In Kargil, hundreds of artefacts displayed at the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum provide a detailed history of the route's fabled past. Just outside of town, stone-carved Greco-Buddhist-style buddhas from to 5th Century showcase the region's past connections to Central Asia and Mediterranean. For an in depth experience, Roots Ladakh offers a 10-day Silk Road expedition that follows the fabled route from Srinagar to Leh via Zoji La and Kargil.\nAt first, Hussain's family was unsure of what to do with the ancient items. In 2002, Florida Atlantic University anthropologists Dr Jacqueline Fewkes and Nasir Khan heard rumours of the collection and travelled to meet Hussain and his relatives. Recognising the artefacts' importance, the anthropologists encouraged the family to preserve the items for future generations. With Hussain's two uncles serving as the director and curator, the family opened the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum in central Kargil where visitors can explore hundreds of Silk Road artefacts ranging from 18th-Century Ladakhi sheep-horn bows to 19th-Century Chinese copper water pipes. To Fewkes, it is the personal anecdotes and family connection to the collection that makes this museum unique and important.\n\"The Munshi Aziz Bhat [museum] doesn't have to, and should not, be the British Museum or the Smithsonian because it offers its own perspective that is invaluable to both local and global audiences,\" Dr Fewkes told me, \"The stories [here] are focused on identities that are significant to the descendants \u2026 family and local histories provide an alternative understanding about the past than national or international narratives that you would see in larger museums in India or abroad.\"\nWhile his uncles run the day-to-day operations at the museum, Hussain focuses on research and retracing his family history \u2013 a heritage he hopes can provide an opportunity to attract visitors and more importantly, help his community reconcile with a difficult past.\n\"I think it's very important that everybody try to preserve their own family histories,\" added Hussain's uncle, Ajaz Munshi. \"In the age of modernisation, we are often going away from our roots, and we must try to keep our legacies intact.\"\nBorn in Leh in 1866, Hussain's great-grandfather, Munshi Aziz Bhat, travelled to Kargil after finishing school in Skardu (modern-day Pakistan). At that time, Kargil was known as an important hub on the Treaty Road \u2013 a branch of the old Silk Road that connected China to Central Asia via Kashmir.\n\"Kargil has always been tied to many parts of the world,\" Hussain told me. \"Its name literally means 'a place to stop [between kingdoms]'.\" A successful accountant, Bhat moved to Kargil where he started a small trade outpost that, by 1920, had grown into seven shops, an inn for travellers and a stable for the many camels, horses and yaks used by long-distance traders who had travelled for up to three months from places like Lhasa or Yarkand. At its height, Bhat's hub housed traders and goods moving between Central Asia, mainland India, China, Europe and the Americas.\n\"I found it interesting to discover how truly globalised this area was during that time,\" Hussain said. \"This region was really cosmopolitan then.\"\nBut Bhat's business was not to last. In 1948 the borders between India and Pakistan closed when the countries were partitioned, essentially shuttering all long-distance trade in and out of Kargil. Bhat retired as one of the last-known traders along one of the final sections of the Silk Road to close, dying later that year. \"When my great-grandfather closed the building,\" Hussain said, \"the rooms remained under lock and key for almost half a century.\"\u00a0\nThe following day while hiking on a ridge above the Mushkoh Valley, Hussain and I passed rings of rocks and an occasional sandbag that remained from the Kargil war. Since the conflict ended, this area located just a few kilometers from the de facto border with Pakistan, retains a lingering reputation amongst Indians as being war-torn and dangerous.\n\"In Kargil and other places impacted by war, I think there is an identity crisis and lack of pride,\" Hussain explained. \"I think tourism is a great tool to help because when people from the outside come to your community and appreciate your heritage, history and culture, it can help your pride return.\"\nHussain and his brother Tafazzul launched Roots Ladakh in 2013, a travel company focusing on the natural and cultural heritage of Kargil. While most visitors to Ladakh stay near the capital Leh to see Buddhist monasteries and search for snow leopards, Hussain hopes to slowly invite more people to his home.\n\"Our vision is to change the preconceived notion about our region as a warzone through the lens of heritage,\" he explained, poking at a fresh snow leopard track in the mud. \"I reminisce a lot about my ancestors and the interesting people they must have met. Kargil today is a transit location, just like in the past, and I feel like I am continuing that legacy by hosting travellers and guests.\"\nFollowing the old Silk Road, Hussain and I snaked our way up the Suru Valley towards the isolated Buddhist kingdom of Zanskar. Turning a corner, I saw three elderly women walking beneath the tongue of a massive glacier, carrying large stacks of hay on their backs. They were preparing for winter while chatting and walking to their homes, which were several steep kilometers away. Hussain offered them and their goods a ride. As the women climbed in, one asked what news Hussain had from the outside world.\nJust as his great-grandparents had done, Hussain turned towards his multicultural band of weary travellers and began to relay stories of politics, trade and faraway lands.\u00a0\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\", Albania is turning to its millennia-old sites and rich cultural heritage to recast its image.\nAfter a period of turmoil, places often talk about looking towards the future. However, 40 years after the death of communist dictator Enver Hoxha, Albania is, in many ways, looking to its distant past. A period of extreme isolationism from the 1940s to 1991 led the Balkan nation to close its religious institutions, neglect many of its historical sites and to become known as \"the North Korea of Europe\". But today, Albania is working hard to reclaim its cultural heritage by preserving its natural landscape and embracing its ancient roots.\nThe more-than-2,500-year-old ruins of the city of Butrint is one such example. Dating back to roughly 800BC, the site has long stood in the centre of the Western world, surviving conflicts, absorbing different cultures and leaving multiple layers of history to explore. It was likely a Greek city-state before the Romans expanded it into a bustling town complete with a bathhouse. Later, the Byzantines and Ottomans both left their respective marks on it. Butrint's history tells the story of the Mediterranean's shifting politics and its many cultures and religions \u2013 all of which have shaped modern-day Albania.\n\"In 1992, [Butrint] was the first place in Albania declared a Unesco World Heritage site,\" explained BBC Travel Show host Qasa Alom in a recent episode. \"[It preserves] some of the rich cultural history that lies beyond the shadow cast by the events of the last century.\"\nToday, the city's sprawling ruins are part of the larger\u00a0Butrint National Park, which includes 93-sq-km of forested coastal landscape. In addition to the historic site, the park is also home to\u00a01,200 different plant and animal species. Visitors can explore the ruins of a Hellenistic-era theatre, admire early Christian monuments and then hike the wooded hills or cruise the nearby Lake Butrint.\nThe preservation of both the ruins and the surrounding parkland are the result of a concerted effort from organisations like the\u00a0Butrint Foundation\u00a0and the\u00a0World Monuments Fund. Donations from both groups have helped restore Butrint and protect the surrounding landscape, while also providing training in historic preservation that created much needed jobs to the local community.\n\"It has been a struggle the last 30 years to protect the beauty and the history of Butrint, originally [because of] the neglect after the fall of communism\u2026 but also with the developers trying to build around the site,\" Ani Tare, former director of the Butrint National Park told the BBC.\nButrint isn't the only part of Albania that has experienced a restoration. In the nation's capital, Tirana, located 278km (173 miles) to the north, many Hoxha-era monuments have been torn down to make way for new community spaces.\u00a0Skanderbeg Square, for example, once home to several monuments dedicated to communism and Hoxha's power, is now the largest pedestrian square in the Balkans. Similarly the towering\u00a0Pyramid of Tirana\u00a0has been transformed from a museum dedicated to Hoxha into a park and sculpture garden with sweeping views of the city.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A 'mini-Greece' by the sea\n\u2022\u00a0Maderia: The far-flung 'Hawaii of Europe'\n\u2022\u00a0The 25 best places to travel in 2025\nArt has also helped Albanians shake off the past and reimagine a new national identity in other ways. At Butrint, for example, programming like their\u00a0annual drama festival, put on inside of the site's ancient stone theatre, has helped bring back a sense of pride and history among the local community.\n\"In the beginning [visitors to the festival were] noisy, they didn't understand what was going on and they used to steal the cushions,\" Tare explained. \"In five years, the local people here would come beautifully dressed, nobody makes noise, everyone respected the theatre, nobody stole cushions. Why?

Butrint: The ancient site helping Albania reclaim its identity27 January 2025Lynn BrownAlamyOnce known as \"the North Korea of Europe\", Albania is turning to its millennia-old sites and rich cultural heritage to recast its image.After a period of turmoil, places often talk about looking towards the future. \"It has been a struggle the last 30 years to protect the beauty and the history of Butrint, originally [because of] the neglect after the fall of communism\u2026 but also with the developers trying to build around the site,\" Ani Tare, former director of the Butrint National Park told the BBC.Butrint isn't the only part of Albania that has experienced a restoration. But today, Albania is working hard to reclaim its cultural heritage by preserving its natural landscape and embracing its ancient roots.The more-than-2,500-year-old ruins of the city of Butrint is one such example. \"In 1992, [Butrint] was the first place in Albania declared a Unesco World Heritage site,\" explained BBC Travel Show host Qasa Alom in a recent episode.",

        "article_text": "Train stations were once the centrepieces of many US cities. After decades of neglect, many places are now reviving them in new, creative ways.\nThe trains don't stop at Union Pacific Depot anymore. So a hotel, the Asher Adams, was built within the former train station in Salt Lake City, Utah, and opened in October 2024. Refreshed with white and gilt detailing and long wooden benches interspersed with plush seats, the resulting space pulls a bit of a mind trick: are you lingering in a lobby or waiting for a train to arrive?\nThe Asher Adams is just one of a spate of recently restored train stations across the US that are being reclaimed as hotels, restaurants, museums and more.\nFrom the late 1800s through the 1920s, many of the US's railway barons built grand train stations. These palaces not only testify to the \"golden age of American railroading\", but serve as a reminder of how the rapid growth of rail travel following the US Civil War helped settle the US West and transform the once-largely rural nation to a coast-to-coast collection of cities. As automobiles and, later, planes became more fashionable than trains, many of these railways consolidated or stopped running, leaving these once-bustling centrepieces of urban life empty.\nSome stations burned down. Others were demolished. But over the past decade, cities have been finding creative ways to breathe new life into the historic structures, helping them regain their cultural cachet while offering travellers an intriguing glimpse into the past.\u00a0\nIn the case of Asher Adams, tearing down the Union Pacific Depot wasn't an option. \"The public had an emotional connection to it,\" recalled Emir Tursic, a partner with HKS Architects, which led the restoration. \"It's part of our cultural heritage.\"\nIt's also one of the oldest buildings in Salt Lake City, he noted. Originally built between 1908 and 1909 as a bustling hub to merge multiple railway lines connecting the American North-west and South-west, the brick-and-sandstone structure hadn't been used for as a railway stop for decades. Instead, part of the structure had been converted into office space ahead of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; another wing became a nightclub. \"The rest was abandoned, especially during the pandemic.\"\nWhat made this structure worth preserving? Aside from its emotional pull and landmarked status, Tursic says its sweeping Second Empire architecture, stained-glass windows, terrazzo floors and two large murals on either side of the hall (including Driving the Golden Spike, depicting the completion of the Transcontinental railroad in 1869).\n\"The craftsmanship simply doesn't exist anymore,\" Tursic said. \"It has a significant value that would be impossible to replace.\"\nTursic also believes these revived spaces offer travellers a unique connection to local culture and history. The Asher Adams, for instance, is named after John Asher and John Adams, two cartographers who first mapped railroad routes throughout the West, and as media in Salt Lake have reported, \"almost everything in [it is] a nod to Utah and railroad history\".\n\"Today's travellers have more intellectual curiosity,\" Tursic explained. While a railway station-turned-hotel may not retain its original function, \"both are related to travel, and this gives us a chance to restore the original character and spirit of the structure. It tells a story in itself: you can sit in the Great Hall and it takes you back.\" Not surprisingly, many visitors immediately take out their phones and start taking photos and videos. \"That's what people are looking for: memorable experiences that are really hard to replicate.\"\nA second reason for the reuse boom: location, location, location.\n\"A lot of towns and cities were built up around their train stations,\" said Glenn NP Nowak, associate professor of architecture at UNLV School of Architecture in Las Vegas, Nevada. As result, many of the structures are located in highly desirable areas. These stations were designed as a \"gateway\" to then-burgeoning locales, where travellers would disembark and get their first impressions of the city. As a result, many boast generously arched entryways or tall columns that strategically frame what are now historic downtowns or other attractions.\n\"You had a sense of arrival,\" said Diana Melichar, president of Melichar Architects in Lake Forest, Illinois, and who has renovated several train stations in smaller communities. \"They were the gateways to these 19th- and 20th-Century cities that were growing. Trains were the mode of transportation [and the message was], this is the grand entry to the town.\"\nPerhaps the most expansive example is the recent transformation of Denver's Union Station into a massive hall encompassing a hotel (The Crawford), restaurants and retail spaces. While trains still whisk passengers from the airport to the hotel and the seasonal Winter Park Express train brings travellers and Denverites up to ski country, Union Station is no longer the robust train hub it was in its heyday.\nIt is, however, an awe-inspiring space. In addition to its enormous scale, it abounds with restored historic details \u2013 antique mirrors; subway tiles; the original ticketing office which has been transformed into a bar; and an old barber shop-turned local ice cream purveyor. Built in 1881 in the wake of the Colorado Gold Rush, the structure was remodelled twice; first by urban preservationist Dana Crawford who spearheaded a $38m revitalisation in 2014, followed by another elegant $11m makeover that was unveiled in July 2024.\n\"[Crawford] had a vision to restore Union Station back to its glory days, when there were 80 trains passing through,\" recalled Ed Blair, area general manager of Sage Hospitality Group, parent company to both the hotel and Union Station. Revived as \"Denver's living room\", the renovation has helped lure tourists and locals back to the city's centre.\nToday, it's a light-filled, multi-storey space, drawing creatives tapping on laptops and sipping locally roasted coffee from Pigtrain. Perhaps the best perch is after dark, from the Cooper Lounge on the second-storey mezzanine, where visitors have a birds-eye view of the 1900s domed-glass chandeliers and Manhattans arrive on shiny silver trays.\nA third reason cited for the boom: sustainability. Most train stations were built for the long haul (pun intended), and to withstand the wear and tear of a steady flow of passengers.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Swiss hotel cut off from the world for 12 hours a day\n \u2022 Europe's stunning high-tech luxury train\n \u2022 A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities\n\"Economically and environmentally, it makes a lot of sense to preserve what you have, instead of tearing something down and building up something new,\" Melichar says. \"If they have good bones, these buildings built of stone or brick will last another century.\"\nOf course, not all train stations are palatial. For example, the former Westfield train station in Westfield, New Jersey, about 22 miles west of New York City, is a modestly sized stone-brick building built in 1892 that sits alongside an active commuter rail. Most recently used as office space, it had fallen into disrepair. After a 2.5-year renovation \u2013 which included removing dead birds from the roof \u2013 it re-opened in October 2024 as the Mexican restaurant Maize Cocina & Cocktails.\n\"We could have gotten a vanilla box, or a turn-key restaurant,\" says Jesa Henneberry, partner and executive chef. \"But we didn't want to tear down history. We wanted to breathe new life into it. I feel good we did that here.\"\nNods to the building's roots are sprinkled throughout the restaurant: wooden banquettes are styled like train station-style benches and cushions made from blue-and-white striped fabric evoke vintage train conductor hats. What was once the luggage room has been transformed into the kitchen and the former waiting room is now part of the bar, where visitors queue for margaritas, not train tickets.\nBest of all, visitors can explore most of these new incarnations for free \u2013 or at least for the small price of a drink or museum ticket, as with the case of Cincinnati's Union Terminal, a dazzling Art Deco landmark now home to the Cincinnati History Museum and the Museum of Natural History & Science.\nBut most importantly, developing these historic spaces is about looking at current-day needs, and overlaying that with what the building has to offer, the pros say. A train station waiting room can be adapted into a unique cultural space \u2013 but only if you have an available train station to adapt.\n\"We like to say that you can't build history,\" said Blair.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "As travellers flock to the English countryside to celebrate the renowned novelist, we asked experts to weigh in on the best Austen-themed festivals, reenactments and balls of the year.\nWith bonnets and boarding passes ready, a brigade of Jane Austen fans from around the world is preparing to bombard Britain, eager to celebrate one of English literature's greatest writers throughout 2025 on her 250th birthday.\nFrom the dashing John Willoughby in Sense and Sensibility to the spirited Emma Woodhouse in the eponymous Emma, Austen's characters have enchanted generations of readers, inspiring yearly pilgrimages to her home county of Hampshire and beyond to trace her footsteps. This year, these journeys take on a celebratory air as travellers flock to the English countryside for literary festivals, reenactments and Regency balls designed to pay tribute to the author.\nHere are the year's most ostentatious events, according to Austen experts \u2013 the ones promising fans an unforgettable birthday bash for a writer who presciently wrote, \"One cannot have too large a party.\"\nAlthough her vivid portrayals of English life now epitomise the extravagance of the Georgian era, Austen's own story began modestly. She was born on 16 December 1775, in the village of Steventon, in Hampshire, England, the seventh child and youngest daughter of clergyman George Austen and his wife Cassandra.\n\"It must have been a bustling household, with the large Austen family and the boys her father tutored,\" said Janet Todd, one of Britain's leading Austen scholars. Although the rectory where the Austens lived was demolished in 1824, St Nicholas Church, where they worshipped, still stands. A dedicated team of volunteers is working to ensure every visit to the historic chapel is memorable.\nNot at all bowing to the idea of being the country cousin to the author's more well-known former towns, like Bath and Chawton, Steventon has organised lively events for June, July and December. Visitors can attend the Jane Austen's Words and Music Chamber concert on 8 June\u00a0 at her family's chapel or join a country fair on 6 June held in the same pump field where the Austen's parsonage home once stood. Then, in remembrance, the church will hold a special Thanksgiving Service for Austen on her birthday on 16 December.\nIn Austen's England, balls were pivotal to social life and courtship among the middle and upper classes. For Zack Pinsent, a 29-year-old tailor known for exclusively wearing Regency-era attire, attending a ball is the ultimate tribute to Austen. This year's calendar is packed with options, from a Regency Week Ball in Alton this June to a Yuletide Birthday Ball in Bath come December. However, Pinsent recommends the Brighton Royal Grand Pavilion Ball on January 25, which he is organising and has already drawn attendees from 16 countries.\n\"Anyone can attend, as long as they have the right outfit,\" said Pinsent, who has secured the Royal Pavilion for the eponymous Regency-inspired event.\nBrighton's Royal Pavilion, built by George IV, Austen's contemporary and admirer, hosted extravagant balls in its heyday. Though there's no evidence Austen ever visited, Pinsent speculates she may have, given Brighton's influence on her imagination. The seaside town even earned a mention in Pride and Prejudice, when Austen wrote of Lydia Bennet: \"At Brighton, she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\"\nAusten set two of her novels, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, in Bath, but her feelings about the resort town remain debated. Her famously dramatic reaction to her family's move there from Steventon \u2013 she allegedly fainted \u2013 hints at reluctance. Still, during her years in Bath (1801-1806), its vibrant social scene, from galas at Sydney Gardens to events at the Assembly Rooms, inspired her work. However, personal tragedy, including her father's death during this time, likely influenced her perception of the city.\n\"The party line is, we don't really know how she felt about Bath,\" said Georgia Delve, director of the Jane Austen Centre Festival (held 12-21 September in Bath). \"But I think in terms of her storyline and the characters, you walk around the city, and it's all written in the stone: you get Bennett Street, you've got Bartlett Street, you've got the Assembly Rooms, you've got the Royal Crescent, you've got the Paragon, you know, great Pulteney Street. All these places come up in her letters and novels.\"\nBath's enduring love for Austen is clear, exemplified by its Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of people in Regency costumes. This year's Austen Festival begins with a grand promenade, drawing fans worldwide.\nBeyond the festival, the Jane Austen Centre is hosting two summer Regency balls, including a Persuasion-themed Nautical Ball on 31 May and a unique Sanditon-inspired event based on Austen's unfinished novel of the same name on 28 June. The event will include dance workshops to master waltzes and cotillions.\nThe port city of Southampton played a role in Austen's life on three occasions \u2013 an often-overlooked fact that the town is hoping to rectify this year. She briefly attended boarding school there, celebrated her 18th birthday at the city's historic Dolphin Hotel, and later stayed there with her brother after departing Bath. To honour the city's deep ties, Southampton plans to display her travel writing desk now through \u200b\u200b23 February at God's House Tower, on loan from the British Library as part of the exhibit In Training for a Heroine. The portable mahogany desk was a gift from her father, and on it, she wrote what she referred to as \"My own darling child,\" the first draft of Pride and Prejudice. Tickets are free, but visitors must reserve a time to see the installation.\nAccording to Todd, much of Austen's enduring appeal lies in her connection to a romanticised England. Hampshire, where she lived, wrote, and set many of her novels, preserved its charm by avoiding industrialisation. This timeless quality makes a visit to the author's former home in Chawton, now called Jane Austen's House, a uniquely transportive experience. After her father's death left Jane, her sister and their mother nearly penniless, with only \u00a3210 a year, according to Todd, Jane's brother Edward eventually moved them into his cottage in 1809. It was here, in this idyllic setting, that Jane refined her six novels.\nMore like this:\n \u2022 What Jane Austen can teach us about resilience\n \u2022 Britain's greatest natural wonders to explore in the wintertime\n \u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\nTo celebrate the writer's 250th birthday, the Jane Austen House hosts a Pride and Prejudice Festival from 23-28 January, featuring Austenmania, a year-long exhibit dedicated to her posthumous cinematic legacy. The site has also launched a permanent exhibition, Jane Austen and the Art of Writing, showcasing her creative process and first editions of her works. \"It's quite moving to be in there with them,\" said 15-year docent Janie McShane of the priceless tomes. For many visitors, that's the real allure, to see how Austen lived, \"to tread,\" McShane said, \"where she tread\".\nAusten was an enthusiastic walker. In a world where a woman's life was nearly always spent supervised or in the company of family and friends, taking a stroll likely meant freedom and escape. \"Austen's characters walk to be themselves and to change,\" writes Rachel Cohen in Austen Years: A Memoir in Five Novels. \nPat Lerew, chair of the Jane Austen Alton Group, says her village will give visitors the same opportunity. Alton is reasonably short stroll from Austen's House. \"We know Jane and her sister walked into Alton two or three times a week to shop or visit with friends,\" Lerew said. \"She would also pick up the coach here to go to London.\" Similarly, the 10-day Jane Austen Regency Week (20-29 June) will include a Regency Day with stalls and entertainment guests can peruse, followed by a ribbon cutting on a new public Jane Austen Garden.\nThe final chapter of Jane's life was tragic. At 41, she fell ill with a mysterious condition that modern experts have speculated may have been Addison's disease or Hodgkin lymphoma. Her deteriorating condition required a move from Chawton cottage to Winchester to seek specialised care. Jane and her sister Cassandra took up residence at No. 8 College Street, a property now owned by Winchester College, a historic boarding school attended by eight of Austen's nephews. This summer, for the first time ever, the school is opening the apartments to the public.\n\"The apartment remains strikingly similar to how it was in Austen's time,\" said Richard Foster, the Fellows' Librarian and Keeper of Collections at the college, who has played a key role in organising the opening. \"Austen describes a neat little drawing room with a bay window overlooking the headmaster's garden, and those features are still intact.\" It was in this space that Austen penned her final poem, and from the same bay window, Cassandra watched her sister's funeral procession \u2013 restricted by 19th-Century customs that barred women from attending.\nTickets for this limited-time opening are available online. Visitors can also honour Austen at her final resting place in the north nave of Winchester Cathedral. Her simple gravestone, devoid of any mention of her literary brilliance, seems almost ironic \u2013 a fact Austen herself might have found darkly amusing. The modest epitaph only nods to the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", a description she might have skewered with her signature wit. After all, as she once wrote, \"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Kate Bush wrote her chart-topping debut single when she was just 18 years old. She told the BBC about the origins of a literary love song that began a unique career in music.\nKate Bush's debut single, Wuthering Heights, was theatrical, undeniably eccentric, and utterly unlike the punk, new wave, prog rock and disco music that dominated the UK charts when it was released 47 years ago this week. And yet the single became an unexpected number one hit in 1978 \u2013 the first song written and performed by a female artist to reach the UK top spot. What makes the single even more idiosyncratic is that its title and story are borrowed from Emily Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel \u2013 but it was actually a television series that spurred Bush to write the song.\n\"Well, I hadn't read the book, that wasn't what inspired it. It was a television series they had years ago,\" she told Michael Aspel in a BBC interview in 1978. As a teenager she had come across the end of an episode of a 1967 BBC adaptation of Bront\u00eb's tale of doomed love. Its startling imagery had captivated her. \"I just managed to catch the very last few minutes where there was a hand coming through the window and blood everywhere and glass. And I just didn't know what was going on and someone explained the story.\"\nBush was just 19 years old when the single was released. Although she may have seemed precocious to the public, she had been writing songs for years. Born in July 1958, the youngest of three children, she grew up in an artistic household in Kent, England. Her father, a doctor, and her mother, a nurse, surrounded their children with music, and encouraged them to learn instruments from an early age. Both of her older brothers were heavily involved in music and poetry, and she would join them performing Irish and English folk songs at home. \"My brothers are very musical, yes. They were really responsible for turning me onto it in the first place. They were always playing music when I was a kid,\" she told Aspel.\nBush began to compose her own songs in her early teens, recording them on homemade demo tapes. One of these tapes found its way via a family friend into the hands of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, who recognised the promise in her songwriting and was particularly taken with the otherworldly quality of her voice. \"I was intrigued by this strange voice,\" he told BBC podcast Profile in 2022. \"I went to her house, met her parents down in Kent, and she played me, God, it must have been 40 or 50 songs.\"\u00a0\nGilmour re-recorded three of Bush's songs with her in his studio for a new demo, and then encouraged Pink Floyd's record label, EMI, to sign her at the age of 16. As Bush was still at school, she spent the first two years of her contract continuing with her studies, while using the record company's advance to enrol in interpretive dance classes with mime artist and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, who had previously taught a young David Bowie.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\n\"I've definitely been influenced by Lindsay Kemp because he's one of my heroes and he was my teacher for a while,\" she told Aspel. \"Marcel Marceau, I admire his stuff, but it is a little too staid for me. It's the art of illusion. It's not really the actual showing of emotion, which is what Lindsay teaches, and for me that's perfect because that's what music in any form of art is about. It's emotion, it's from inside.\"\u00a0\nAt the same time, she was also honing her musical craft. She formed a group called the KT Bush Band and began playing in London pubs while working on songs for her debut album, The Kick Inside. The singer told the BBC that she tended to compose these songs late in the evening. \"It seems to be the time of day that things gather, you know. I wake up about 11pm, I'm sort of sleepy all day, then at 11pm I really wake up.\" One night when she was 18, she sat down at the piano to write a song from the perspective of Bront\u00eb's passionate, conflicted heroine, Catherine Earnshaw, who haunts her lover Heathcliff, both during her life and after she dies. The imagery from the Wuthering Heights TV adaptation \"was just hanging around for years\", she said, \"so I read the book in order to get the research right\".\nThe song's lyrics evoke Catherine's obsessive longing for Heathcliff, her mercurial nature, and the couple's charged, destructive relationship. Bush also wanted to convey Catherine's ghostly presence, so she adopted high-pitched, keening vocals to give the song an eerie, haunting air. \"It was really specifically for that song, it was that high because of the subject matter,\" she said. \"I'm playing Cathy and she was a spirit, and it needed some kind of ethereal effect, and it seemed to be the best way to do it, to get a high register.\"\u00a0\nWuthering Heights, with its lush, sweeping orchestration, its literary sensibilities, and Bush's soaring theatrical delivery, did not strike her record company as an obvious radio hit. EMI instead wanted the rockier sounding James and the Cold Gun, a favourite from her KT Bush Band's pub set, to be the first single from the album. But Bush was adamant that Wuthering Heights should be her debut \u2013 and EMI eventually relented.\u00a0\nTo accompany its release, two music videos were filmed. One was\u00a0studio-based\u00a0and the other was shot\u00a0outside, with Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, standing in for the novel's windswept Yorkshire moors. For the shoots, Bush used the interpretive dance instruction she had received to mesmerising effect. Both videos feature her gazing intensely at the camera, clad in floaty dresses while performing dramatic and emotive dance movements to express the spectral essence of Cathy. Her dance routine was so distinctive that it became something of a cultural touchstone, inspiring both\u00a0comedic homages\u00a0and an\u00a0annual event\u00a0called The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever, at which Bush devotees recreate her performance from the videos.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eartha Kitt: from 'extreme poverty' to stardom\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\n\u2022\u00a0How a child star saved a Hollywood studio\nThe single would prove to be her breakthrough. Within three weeks of being released, it had reached number one, getting a boost from Bush's arresting mime-style performance on the BBC's music chart show,\u00a0Top of the Pops. It knocked Abba's Take a Chance on Me off the UK singles chart's top spot, and stayed there for a month. It also topped the charts in Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Australia. Her album, The Kick Inside, when it was released the following month, sold more than one million copies. She would go on to collect an Ivor Novello award in 1979 for The Man with The Child in His Eyes, released as her second single from the album.\nWuthering Heights marked the start of Bush's innovative, critically acclaimed and shape-shifting musical career. She has now released a total of 10 studio albums, melding diverse influences, complex musical storytelling and new technologies, such as sampling, to spawn hit singles like Hounds of Love and Babooshka. She has also collaborated with artists including Prince and Elton John. Her duet with Peter Gabriel, Don't Give Up, would pick up another Ivor Novello award in 1987.\nIn 2022, Bush reached a whole new generation of fans when her 1985 hit Running Up That Hill started trending on TikTok, after being used in the Netflix series Stranger Things. It gave Bush her first top 10 hit in the US and reached number one in the UK charts, 44 years after her debut single. \"It's just extraordinary,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in 2022. \"It's such a great series. I thought that the track would get some attention. But I just never imagined that it would be anything like this.\"\nAt the time of her appearance on Michael Aspel's show in 1978, she was already working on her second studio album, Lionheart, and preparing to tour her music with what would be a lavish stage show called The Tour of Life. The performances embraced the theatricality of Bush's songs, featuring dance, poetry, mime and magic, with the singer making multiple costume changes and pioneering the use of a headset microphone on stage. \"I've always wanted to be involved in music,\" Bush told Aspel. \"I never thought I would be able to sing them, to sing my songs, but it seems that I have done it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "From bubblegum-coloured lakes in Australia to a solar-powered safari camp in Botswana, these are BBC journalists' top destinations this year.\nTravel has the power to connect, inspire and even transform us. Peering over the edge of a crashing waterfall in Newfoundland and ascending sawtooth spires in the Italian Dolomites reveal how wondrous the world can be. But while travel should be a force for good, the past year has reminded us that it also has the potential to overwhelm and even harm the places we love, and many destinations are now imposing new restrictions as they grapple with the negative effects of overtourism.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the BBC's inaugural guide to the best places to travel this year, we wanted to highlight the destinations experiencing the opposite phenomenon. Each of these 25 spots is not only welcoming visitors and offering incredible travel experiences, but also using tourism to support local communities, protect the environment or preserve their unique cultural heritage. We compiled the list with input from BBC Travel journalists and some of the world's leading sustainable travel authorities, such as the United Nations World Travel Organization, Sustainable Travel International, the Black Travel Alliance and\u00a0the World Travel & Tourism Council.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nAs tourism in many regions soars past pre-pandemic levels, and extreme weather and climate change reveal the fragile impermanence of many bucket-list destinations, travelling thoughtfully means considering where your trip can serve a larger good.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom trekking through a moonlike landscape in Bolivia to Arctic glamping in Greenland on the world's largest island, your next great adventure is just ahead.\nEver wanted to swim alongside sperm whales? Dominica now offers the chance to do it in an ethical, sustainable way as part of the Caribbean island's groundbreaking commitment to marine conservation and regenerative tourism. The island nation recently established the\u00a0world's first sperm whale reserve, a protected marine area designed to safeguard its resident giants. Limited permits for whale swims ensure intimate, respectful encounters, offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience to share the water with these incredible cetaceans while facilitating research and creating sustainable tourism opportunities for local residents.\nNew for 2025, expanded infrastructure and systems are set to welcome visitors, including digital immigration forms to ease arrival and the development of a cable-car system taking riders from\u00a0Roseau Valley\u00a0up to\u00a0Boiling Lake, one of the world's largest thermal springs. Access to the island has never been easier: on top of existing American Airlines flights from Miami, United Airlines is\u00a0launching direct flights\u00a0from Newark starting 15 February. Several new hotels are opening in 2025 (adding nearly 500 rooms with a 25% increase in inventory), including the six-star Hilton\u00a0Tranquility Beach Resort and Spa\u00a0in Salisbury. Or choose a tried-and-true classic such as\u00a0Secret Bay,\u00a0a luxury eco-property that frequently tops sustainability lists.\nDominica is also home to Project CETI, a groundbreaking international effort to decode whale language, clicks and codas, led by National Geographic Explorer David Gruber. Elsewhere, visitors can explore hidden gorges, towering waterfalls and feast on local cuisine at unique eateries, such as the farm-to-table Lacou. Dominica isn't just a destination \u2013 it's a movement to support a burgeoning model of eco-tourism that balances biodiversity conservation with economic growth, ensuring that your adventure helps protect this natural paradise for generations to come. \u2013 Pier Nirandara\nHome to one of Yayoi Kusama's iconic yellow, polka-dotted\u00a0Pumpkin\u00a0sculptures, the Japanese island of Naoshima has become a must-see destination for connoisseurs of contemporary art and architecture. Once known (if at all) for its highly polluting copper smelting industry, the island's transformation is thanks to Benesse Art Site Naoshima, which has helped create major museums and site-specific artworks in the scenically stunning (and dramatically population-dwindling) Seto Inland Sea, located between Japan's main island of Honshu and Shikoku.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nSpring 2025 sees the opening of the Naoshima New Museum of Art, designed by Tadao Ando, the award-winning architect behind nine other projects on the island. This new showcase for works by Asian artists will be a major highlight of this year's Setouchi Triennale, with events and unveilings of artwork scattered across 17 islands and coastal areas of the Seto Inland Sea. Scheduled over 100 days and split between spring, summer and autumn to allow visitors to enjoy the region through the different seasons, this is the largest iteration of the Triennale since it began in 2010.\u00a0The festival and activities of Benesse Art Site Naoshima have been instrumental in turning not only Naoshima's fortunes around but also reviving the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima. \u00a0\u00a0\nBook ahead to visit Rei Naito and Ryue Nishizawa's Teshima Art Museum, a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art, architecture and nature; while on Inujima, travellers will be amazed by the remains of a historic copper refinery reimagined as an epic-scale art installation. Memorable places to stay include Roka, a contemporary-styled ryokan on Naoshima, and the elegantly minimalist Espoir Inn on Teshima.\u00a0\u2013 Simon Richmond\u00a0\u00a0\nPerpetual fan favourite Italy hardly needs more press \u2013 especially in a year when its supremely overtouristed capital, Rome, will be even more overwhelmed due to the 2025 Jubilee. But if Italy is still on your bucket list for 2025, consider taking a detour north to the Dolomite Mountains.\nFor Italians, the ruggedly beautiful Dolomites are synonymous with family fun and luxury holidays. The stunning sawtooth limestone cliffs sprawl across the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, attracting vacationing Italians in droves each year for their exquisite villages; peerless \"white week\" skiing; epic hike; and world-class, stick-to-your-ribs Alpine dishes. This classic Italian playground is often overlooked by overseas visitors \u2013 but that's all poised to change.\nThe \"Queen of the Dolomites\", Cortina d'Ampezzo, has been slated to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The preparations, which will take place throughout 2025, include a vast series of infrastructure improvements throughout the area \u2013 all against a backdrop of pre-Olympic buzz. Visitors can expect to find expanded ski lift networks in the Dolomiti Superski area, where the towns of Alta Badia and Val Gardena will launch modernised lifts and enhanced connections to public transit operating within the area. New and upgraded cable cars, lifts and gondolas will also be introduced throughout the regions' towns.\u00a0\nBut the Dolomites is a thrilling destination in all seasons; visit in spring, summer and autumn to enjoy excellent trails, like 2024's new Cammino Retico (The Rhaetian Way); a 170km, seven-day trail connecting remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. And for pure relaxation, the luxury Aman Rosa Alpina hotel will have its grand reopening in 2025. The property will now offer 51 guest rooms and suites, two presidential suites and the private Chalet Zeno. Visit now, before the crowds descend. \u2013 Eva Sandoval\nThere is nowhere on Earth like Greenland. Spanning more than two million sq km, the world's largest island has a population of less than 57,000. Covered by a vast ice cap and spectacular mountains, its unspoiled wilderness and majestic fjords aren't just a coveted geopolitical entity; they offer adventures of a lifetime.\nStunning hiking and spellbinding whale watching in summer and traditional dog sledding and the magical aurora in winter all make Greenland a bucket-list destination. However, it has been remote, expensive and time-consuming to reach \u2013 until now.\nWith the opening of a new international airport in the capital city of Nuuk and two more following in 2026, getting to Greenland has never been easier. The country is welcoming mindful adventure travellers who love exploring while also respecting its incredible nature and unique Inuit culture. Greenland has adopted a pledge \"towards better tourism\" and a new law aims to steer funds from tourism towards benefitting local communities.\nA modern town with a historic waterfront, informative museums and impressive art galleries, Nuuk is also a launchpad for hiking, fishing and glamping trips and acts as a gateway for exploring a remarkable Arctic territory. Further north in Ilulissat, visitors can discover the jaw-dropping icebergs of Disko Bay and dramatic Unesco-recognised Icefjord. In the south, a region once settled by Vikings, there are gorgeous fjords and scenic green hills dotted with sheep farms. \u2013 Adrienne Murray Nielsen\nThough just one-sixth the size of England and far less visited than its more famous UK counterparts, Wales is filled with stunning national parks, awe-inspiring medieval castles and virtually no crowds \u2013 which only adds to its appeal. The new year offers travellers an additional excuse to explore one of Europe's most up-and-coming destinations: Wales is celebrating 2025 as the Year of Croeso (\"Welcome\"). The year-long event showcases Welsh culture, language and attractions while inviting visitors to \"Feel the hwyl\" \u2013 an untranslatable Welsh word describing a deep state of joy that comes from being immersed in the moment.\nIn recent years, Wales has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainable, culturally focused travel. Tourism has helped play a role in the revival of the Welsh language and the nation is in the midst of a multi-year \u00a35 billion programme that uses tourism funds to make various destinations more environmentally sustainable. As part of its Year of Croeso, Wales is investing in mobility bikes to help more adventure-seekers explore its wild side. What's more, Wales is home to the Wales Coast Path, the only hiking path in the world that runs the entire length of a country's coastline. \u2013 Eliot Stein\nLabrador, the mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada, is a vast, rugged region known for its windswept coastal villages, towering icebergs, subarctic forests and massive waterfalls \u2013 all underpinned by more than 9,000 years of human history. In 2025, the completion of the last stage of the 1,200km Trans-Labrador Highway \u2013 a feat that took nearly 25 years and $1bn to build \u2013 transforms this remote 294,330 sq km landscape into a more accessible destination.\nThe new circular route (known as Expedition 51) connects Labrador with five Canadian provinces while offering detours into the US and even France (via St Pierre and Miquelon). To encourage sustainable tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage in this formerly isolated part of the north, the Canadian government has invested $180m into Parks Canada sites in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2025, Red Bay National Historic Site, a Unesco World Heritage Site and former Basque whaling station, will debut a new interactive boardwalk and visitor centre; L'Anse aux Meadows, home to the first Norse settlement in North America, is enhancing its ecological protections and upgrading visitor facilities; while Gros Morne National Park will introduce new interpretive exhibits that highlight the park's dramatic geology, wildlife and landscapes. \u2013 Diane Selkirk\u00a0\nTucson has a lot to celebrate in 2025. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when it became the first city in the US to receive a Unesco City of Gastronomy distinction, as well as the 250th anniversary of the city's founding. Originally part of Mexico, the area now called Tucson will celebrate its unique multi-national history, as well as the deep-rooted Native American cultures that make it special, with a free event on 23 August featuring traditional Mexican music and dancing held at the Presidio San Agustin del Tucson. Visitors throughout the year can explore Tucson's miles of desert hiking trails and historic buildings \u2013 like the 250-year-old San Xavier del Bac, the so-called \"White Dove of the Desert\". Preservation like this points to why the city is set to receive a Sustainability Index Award from the Global Destination Sustainability Movement (GDS) this year.\u00a0\nBut while the building's history is impressive, the nearby gardens reveal an even richer history: they are the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US. Four thousand years ago, the Tohono O'odham's ancestors farmed squashes, beans and corn on this land. After mixing and melding with Mexican and other Indigenous flavours over the centuries, many of these ancient herbs and crops are still staples in kitchens across the city. Diners can immerse themselves in the city's unique food scene at one of its city-of-gastronomy-certified restaurants or Heirloom Farmers Markets, which regularly feature unique local ingredients such as chiltepin chilis, edible cacti called nopales and prickly pear. \u2013 Lynn Brown\nKnown as the world's most isolated big city, Perth \u2013 and the state of Western Australia (WA) \u2013 have long played second fiddle to the east coast cities of Melbourne and Sydney. However, with Australia's only direct flights to Europe, Perth is positioning itself as Australia's western gateway and a global aviation hub, with a $5bn redevelopment of Perth Airport set to enhance the travel experience. And with new connections to Asia, WA is poised to become a must-visit destination in 2025.\nBut it's not just about getting here \u2013 it's about what awaits. Outside of newly cool Perth and its gorgeous Swan Valley Wine Region, WA's vast landscapes span more than 2.5 million sq km, encompassing 12,500km of pristine coastline, bubblegum-pink lakes, horizontal waterfalls, towering karri forests, wildflowers, wineries and wildlife encounters like swimming with whale sharks and snapping selfies with quokkas, the \"happiest animal in the world\". Sustainability-minded road trippers can explore it all on the new 6,600km Electric Vehicle Highway, the world's longest EV charging network.\nWA is also championing its rich cultural heritage through the A$20m Jina Aboriginal Tourism Action Plan that supports authentic Indigenous-led experiences for travellers as well as Indigenous business development. Learn about the oldest living cultures on Earth on a truth-telling walking tour in Rockingham or a 4WD tag-along coast foraging tour complete with bush barbecue in Broome.\u00a0\nAdd ancient petroglyphs at Murujuga National Park (under consideration for Unesco World Heritage status in 2025), new disability-friendly infrastructure and equipment on the stunning Houtman Abrolhos Islands, boutique hotels in Fremantle and tiny dream stays in the Great Southern, and WA is set to redefine travel to Australia this year. \u2013 Ellie Cobb\nFrom its misty hilltop tea plantations and roaming wild elephants to its ancient temples and rolling surf, Sri Lanka is a country that ticks lots of boxes. In April 2022, the former prime minister announced Sri Lanka's bankruptcy, but a new president aims to rebuild the country's fortunes after it was hit by a pandemic and civil unrest.\nThe resilient island nation is hoping to get back on its feet through tourism. The city of Kandy will see the opening of its first seven-star hotel, Aviyana Private Chalets, while Aarunya Nature Resort has a new family villa that includes an oculus for stargazing. There's a $1bn megaresort opening in Colombo, and the launch of Sri Lanka's new airline Air Ceil\u00e3o, which will fly as far as Europe and Australia. The nation also recently launched the Good Travel Seal initiative, which celebrates local businesses who have adopted sustainable practices.\u00a0\nVisitors looking for a coolcation can take a\u00a0legendary train ride\u00a0into its mountainous interior, or travel to Colombo and Galle to discover a new generation of mixologists putting their spin on arrack, a 5th-Century drink. The island has also opened the 300km\u00a0Pekoe Trail, which takes hikers through tea plantations and rural villages in the Central Highlands. For those who want to cover more ground, an innovative startup allows travellers to\u00a0self-drive a tuk tuk\u00a0across the island, with the money going directly to the owner. \u2013\u00a0Claire Turrell\nAfter managing the Panama Canal for decades, the US handed control of it over to Panama at the end of 1999 in a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Panama's sovereignty over its namesake waterway, and as President-elect Donald Trump hints at the possibility of using military force to reseize it, a series of new permanent exhibits at the landmark's Museo del Canal highlighting its path to Panamanian rule feels especially timely.\u00a0\nYet, there's more to see in this nation of vast jungles, idyllic islands and mountainous forests beyond the canal. In 2024, the Meaningful Travel Map to Panama launched in partnership with non-profit Tourism Cares to make it easier for visitors to find locally led travel experiences across the country. After embarking on a Localinpty walking tour through Panama City's Casco Antiguo and El Chorrillo neighbourhoods, head south-west to the La Pintada district, where artists weave fibers to make traditional Panama hats by hand \u2013 a Unesco-recognised practice known as sombrero pintao. In El Valle de Anton (named one of the best community tourism villages by UN Tourism in 2024) take a hike through a lush cloud forest on the Cerro Gaital Lookout Trail where you can see both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea on a clear day from the summit. This newly opened path is part of Panama's ongoing 1,000 km of Trails project, which seeks to boost sustainable tourism in rural communities while bringing hikers face to face with Panama's staggering biodiversity. \u2013 Kathleen Rellihan\nSnowcapped mountains, sweeping deserts, ancient cities and rich cultural heritage have long made Morocco one of North Africa's most popular destinations. But the Al Haouz earthquake of September 2023 not only devastated parts of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains, it also severely impacted tourism. As Morocco continues to build (and rebuild) its tourism infrastructure in preparation for co-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the nation is aiming to double its tourist arrivals in the next five years.\u00a0\nBypass the crowds by taking a road trip through the Rif Mountains in Morocco's less-frequented northern region. The planned 2025-2027 expansion of Morocco's High-Speed Rail (HSR) network will create a multitude of new train lines, including a link from Rabat to the ancient, 1,300-year-old walled Rif Mountain city of Fez; home to a Unesco World Heritage medina and the host of several games in the Africa Cup of Nations 2025. From Fez, it's a 65km drive north to Moulay Idriss, an ancient hilltop village once closed to non-Muslims. Pass through olive and almond groves and mountain villages for a stop in Ouezzane \u2013 a centre of Sufism \u2013 then continue north to Talassemtane National Park to hike through cedar forests, climb craggy red peaks and dive into natural swimming holes. Further north is the town of Chefchaouen, known as the \"Blue Pearl\" for its blue-painted buildings and streets. Finally, cruise along Morocco's northern coast, unwinding in sleepy Mediterranean fishing villages like El Jebha and the white-washed Spanish colonial buildings of Tetouan. \u2013 Alicia Erickson\nThe northern English city of Bradford is finally poised to step out from the long shadow cast by its giant Yorkshire neighbour, Leeds, as it takes its place as the 2025 UK City of Culture. A fabulous year-long programme of events includes the re-opening of the National Science and Media Museum, plus innovative celebrations of local cultural icons: more than 400 works by Bradford-born artist David Hockney held in a Unesco World Heritage 1850s mill; new digital takes on a fantasy world dreamed up by the famed literary Bront\u00eb sisters; and a musical programme mixing an electronic bassline symphony, old factory folk music, brass bands and South Asian sounds.\nThe diversity of offerings reflects the eye-opening variety of a city whose historic enclaves like Little Germany \u2013 where 19th-Century Teutonic wool merchants built an array of neoclassical warehouses \u2013 are complemented by a landscape of dramatic moors that play host to an extraordinary open-air immersive sound walk mixing contemporary classical music with a sculpture trail. A special energy also comes from the local residents who represent diverse backgrounds (and youth \u2013 a quarter are under 20 years old).\nBradford's historic streets and rugged country setting helped the city become Britain's first Unesco City of Film (an accolade shared with places as varied as Rome, Sydney and Busan) \u2013 a setting for screen hits including BBC series like Peaky Blinders and Gentleman Jack, and classic films like The Railway Children and Wuthering Heights.\u00a0\nAnd this year, there's even an interactive cookbook project, celebrating recipes from local communities and showing that in 2025, Bradford is truly a destination to please all tastes. \u2013 Norman Miller\nHome to some of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes and the ancient capital of one of history's most mysterious civilisations, Jordan never fails to evoke wonder. But take a closer look and you'll find that the country has been quietly building up its reputation as the Middle East's go-to destination for outdoor adventure-seekers.\u00a0\nVisiting Jordan\nWhile the ongoing Israel-Gaza war continues to compromise Jordan's tourism industry, both the UK Foreign Office and US State Department currently consider Jordan to be relatively safe to explore.\u00a0\nIn 2023, a stunning new 10-day, 120km-long hiking path known as the Wadi Rum Trail opened, which weaves through the rust-red walls of Jordan's iconic Wadi Rum, tracing the otherworldly landscapes featured in the films Star Wars, Dune and The Martian. Visitors have traditionally breezed through the desert here on 4x4 tours, but this community tourism project promotes a slower, more sustainable form of travel that protects the desert's delicate ecosystem while safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the local Bedouin community.\u00a0\nElsewhere, this Maine-sized nation is teeming with 33 protected land and marine ecosystems. At the Wadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve (the world's lowest-lying nature reserve at 410m below sea level), visitors can search for the illusive desert-dwelling Nubian ibex while climbing, swimming and sliding their way through a sandstone gorge to the base of a crashing waterfall. The Dana Biosphere Reserve (Jordan's largest), is home to 180 bird species and 25 endangered mammal species. The rich coral reefs of the Aqaba Marine Reserve, which was added to the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas in January 2025, support more than 500 fish species and a growing diving scene. \u2013 Florence Craig\nAlmost completely isolated from the outside world for centuries, this erstwhile hermit kingdom nestled in the Himalayas only began welcoming foreigners in 1974. It's since become a global leader in sustainability: it's the world's first carbon-negative nation, more than 60% of its land is protected forest and it measures Gross National Happiness instead of GDP.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Haa Valley, a pristine forested district along Bhutan's western frontier with Tibet, has long been the country's best-kept secret: a culturally distinct region still untouched by mass tourism. This forgotten corner of the Thunder Dragon Kingdom was the last district to open to foreigners in 2002, and today, fewer than 2% of international travellers visit, despite it being a yak's graze from Paro International Airport. It's now emerging from the shadows, balancing preservation with thoughtful development in its bid for more visitors.\u00a0\nTravellers can explore Haa's raw beauty through the newly restored 400km Trans Bhutan Trail; the freshly-added 11km Haa Panorama Trail (a revival of an ancient route); and the two-day Joy Bay Tsho Trek, which snakes through pastures, canopy forests and bamboo groves between the villages of Mochu and Youkha.\nHaa's commitment to sustainable tourism means you'll find locally run homestays (and some local hotels) offering glimpses into centuries-old rural life. Two distinct, low-impact accommodations have also opened: the community-run Katsho Eco Camp, built along the Haa Panorama Trail by guides and cooks who lost their jobs during the pandemic, and the luxury Sangwa Camp. Here, visitors witness local culture, like Bon rituals and rare experiences such as breakfast in Bhutan's lone strict nature reserve, a highly protected biodiversity hotspot home to rare species like the red panda and snow leopard.\nWith Bhutan's Sustainable Daily Fee halved through 2027 (now $100), this once-secluded paradise is now more accessible while remaining just as committed to low-impact tourism. \u2013 Erin Levi\nMore than a year after a series of deadly wildfires devastated Maui, the entire state is experiencing a dramatic downturn in visitors. As families and local businesses continue to rebuild, they're asking travellers to return, but to do so responsibly.\u00a0\nEnter the M\u0101lama Hawaii programme. Meaning \"to protect\" or \"give back\", m\u0101lama is a Hawaiian word embodying a sense of stewardship and respect for the environment. As such, the programme pairs travellers with more than 350 volunteer opportunities, ranging from restoring native forests to sewing and cooking with Maui families to helping to preserve plant and animal habitats on the slopes of Mount Kea. In exchange, travellers receive discounted \u2013 or in some cases, free \u2013 stays at dozens of hotels and resorts across the islands, including the famous Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea where the first season of The White Lotus was filmed. \u2013 Eliot Stein\nUzbekistan has one of the youngest populations in the world \u2013 more than 60% are under 30. Being surrounded by a sea of young people on Tashkent's metros, which double as art museums with Soviet-era mosaics, you can see a new generation taking over. As the country strives to maintain its unique traditions and cultures, it is investing in tourism with new hotels, train routes, domestic flights and cultural attractions to grow its economy, retain its youth and attract more visitors.\nUzbekistan is getting its first major international biennial with the Bukhara Biennial in September 2025. Other major cultural developments include an expansion of the State Museum of Arts designed by Tadao Ando and the restoration and partial reconstruction of the Palace of Prince Romanov.\nAs of May 2024, citizens of more than 90 countries (including the UK, Canada and Australia) can visit Uzbekistan without a visa. The president has said he intends to create a Global Green Tourism Startup Lab to bring together the country's commitment to a green economy with tourism. Crossing the border with neighbouring countries has also become easier. The region's first international railway route, the Silk Road railway tour, launched in November 2024 and now connects Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. \u2013 Kathleen Rellihan\nHaida Gwaii, an archipelago of more than 150 islands off the coast of British Columbia, offers more than breathtaking landscapes \u2013 it provides a profound connection to nature, culture and history. Isolated from the mainland, the ecologically rich islands are home to more than 6,800 species, including endemic birds, mammals and plants that have sustained the Haida People for at least 15,000 years.\nWhat makes Haida Gwaii a standout destination in 2025 is the groundbreaking Gaayhllxid/G\u00edihlagalgang \"Rising Tide\" Haida Title Lands Agreement. This legislation marks a transformative moment in Indigenous rights in Canada, officially recognising the Council of the Haida Nation as the territory's governing body under federal law. This shift is working to revitalise Haida culture and strengthen their environmental stewardship.\u00a0\nVisitors can explore long-abandoned Haida villages like SG\u0331ang Gwaay, a Unesco World Heritage Site with ancient mortuary poles and longhouse remains; and encounter distinctive wildlife such as the Haida Gwaii black bear (called taan in the local dialect) and seabirds like puffins and ancient murrelets. Upon arrival, guests are introduced to Haida Laws, including the concept of Gina 'waadluxan gud ad kwaagid (\"everything depends on everything else\"), a teaching that underscores our shared responsibility to care for the Earth. \u2013 Diane Selkirk\nHome to mist-shrouded rainforests, emerald lakes, towering volcanoes and one of the Americas' oldest and most attractive cities (Unesco-enshrined Granada, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in December 2024), Central America's largest country remains one of its least visited. That may soon change with the opening of the new Carretera Costanera: a $400m, 350km-long highway linking 53 beaches along the nation's Pacific Coast, from the Gulf of Fonseca in the north to the turquoise waters of Playa El Naranjo in the south.\n\u00a0\nSet to be completed in 2025, the ambitious new infrastructure project makes it much easier to shoot south from Nicaragua's sprawling capital, Managua, to the tropical forests and the world-class surf hubs of San Juan del Sur and Popoyo along the country's 50km-long Emerald Coast \u2013 which has been luring in-the-know backpackers for years. More importantly, the Costanera is aiming to breathe new economic life into the nation, which is one of the poorest in the Western hemisphere and views its growing tourism sector as key to its economic growth.\u00a0\nAfter learning to ride a wave at a locally owned surf camp and sleeping in a treehouse tucked inside a rainforest, venture to the Refugio de Vida Silvestre La Flor at the highway's southern tip, where thousands of endangered olive ridley and leatherback turtles lay their eggs between September and October in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \u2013 Eliot Stein\nDespite being ringed on all sides by the UK \u2013 Northern Ireland to the west, Scotland to the north, England to the east and Wales to the south \u2013 this cliff-fringed island isn't actually part of the Commonwealth. Instead, the self-governing isle is said to be ruled by the world's oldest continuous parliament, the Tynwald, and it's committed to preserving its distinct character and developing a sustainable tourism model.\nAwash with ancient historical sites, such as Cashtal yn Ard (\"Castle of the Height\", the largest Neolithic tomb in the British Isles) and Castle Rushen (one of the most complete medieval structures in Europe), the 85,000-resident island is decidedly forward-thinking. In 2016 it was recognised as a Unesco Biosphere (the world's only self-governing territory whose entire land and sea area has such designation) for its commitment to environmental preservation and cultural heritage. This year, witness the isle's spectacular native bird species at the new Manx Birdlife Point of Ayre National Reserve, which opened to the public in July 2024. Also on tap for 2025 is the 175th anniversary of Okell's Brewery, so celebrate this iconic Manx brew by partaking in tasting tours that will be held throughout the year.\nIn addition to learning a few words in Manx Gaelic (the island's historical language) and familiarising yourself with the Manx pound (the island's unique currency), one of the best ways to understand this unique British Crown Dependency is to explore it on foot. Taking advantage of the isle's myriad of organised walking events, hikers will find rolling English fields, misty Irish hills and craggy Welsh coastlines \u2013 as well as dramatic Scottish Highland-esque peaks on the Isle's highest point, Snaefell mountain. On a clear day, trekkers can turn in a circle on its wind-whipped summit to see each country in the UK and Ireland. \u2013 Lynn Brown\nPakistan is one of the world's most populated nations, yet it remains one of the great surprises for travellers.\u00a0That may soon change, as the country is hoping a slew of responsible tourism initiatives and new sustainable efforts will lure eco-conscious visitors to explore its breathtaking northern regions; home to five of the planet's 14 peaks towering over 8,000m \u2013 including the world's second highest, K2.\u00a0\nSalam Pakistan (Pakistan's first-ever national tourism brand, which launched in 2023) allows travellers to easily apply for e-visas and make bookings on the digital platform, including the coveted mountaineering and trekking visa. It only takes a quick glance at the list of mountain peaks and treks to see the scale of Pakistan's unmatched adrenaline opportunities.\u00a0\nYet, Pakistan is much more than staggering mountain trails. The scenic Gilgit-Baltistan region \u2013 dubbed \"heaven's gate\" \u2013 is brimming with lush valleys, pristine lakes and glacial waterfalls. Cradled between trails are the Hunza Valley's fragrant cherry blossoms and apricot orchards, undulating Unesco-listed Deosai plains and Shangri-La-esque mirrored lakes. Venture towards the Pakistan-China border to find the Khunjerab Pass, which will be operational year-round starting in 2025. \u2013 Aysha Imtiaz\nMarooned in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500km west of Lisbon, this nine-island Portuguese archipelago is one of Europe's most isolated destinations and is known for its steaming natural hot springs, jewel-coloured lakes and sparkling lava tubes. The Azores already boast some of the continent's most dramatic black-sand beaches and best whale-watching opportunities, but the islands can now add another superlative to the list: Europe's largest protected marine sanctuary.\nIn a groundbreaking piece of legislation approved in October 2024, the Azores' newly designated Marine Protected Area will extend 287,000 sq km (an expanse larger than all of Great Britain) and safeguard deep-sea corals, sharks and the 28 species of whales and dolphins found here. Protecting the long-term health and biodiversity of these coral reefs will be a boon for travellers eager to participate in whale-watching and sustainable marine research expeditions in the years to come.\u00a0\nElsewhere, a scenic drive from the capital of Ponta Delgada, Furnas Valley is home to two active volcanoes. Spend some time hot spring hopping your way across the bubbling geothermal valley, wander through lush botanical gardens or enjoy a leisurely stroll in Terra Nostra Park, arguably one of Europe's most beautiful parks. Dating back to 1775, the eponymous Terra Nostra Garden Hotel is a bonafide green retreat that will offer guests 24-hour access to their newly enhanced thermal pools and jacuzzis starting in January 2025. Don't leave without sampling the cozido das Furnas \u2013 a local meat stew buried underground and slow-cooked using the volcanic hot springs' natural heat. Nearby, sample purple volcanic tea at Chalet da Tia Merc\u00eas, or plan a visit to the family-owned Gorreana Tea Factory, the oldest (and only) tea plantation in Europe. \u2013 Michelle Gross\nKansas City, Missouri is making 2025 its glow-up year. The city heretofore known as \"Paris of the Plains\" is busily promoting its creative arts scene and status as one of North America's barbeque capitals, all while launching an urban revitalisation plan that includes new museums, entertainment districts and hotels.\nAt the heart of the rebrand is the Museum of BBQ, the world's first museum dedicated to the art of smoked meat. Slated to open at the Crown Center shopping district in spring 2025, the immersive experience will delve into Kansas City's deep barbeque culture, leading visitors through interactive exhibits culminating in a gift shop selling all manner of BBQ goods.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Berkley Riverfront\u00a0will continue to see new dining experiences, shops and apartment buildings among its incoming development.\nThe Kansas City International Airport completed significant renovations in 2023, with the $1.5bn expansion replacing outdated terminals and improving passenger flow. This year will also see upgrades to the KC Streetcar; a 3.5-mile Main Street extension expected to open this summer that will make it even easier to reach some of the city's premier destinations, including the Union Hill shopping district and the National WWI Museum and Memorial \u2013 home to the world's most comprehensive collection of World War One objects and documents. And when Rock Island Bridge re-opens in spring 2025, it will become the site of a new entertainment district \u00adset 40ft feet over a river. \u2013 Eva Sandoval\nEven if you've already stargazed at the spacelike Uyuni salt flats (the world's largest) and trekked breathlessly around the hilly capital of La Paz (the world's highest), Bolivia is worth a visit in 2025. This August marks the country's 200th anniversary and it's celebrating with events and attractions throughout the year in the capitals of its nine regions.\u00a0\u00a0\nVisit from 24 February to 5 March for the Oruro Carnival, which includes a multi-day folk-dance parade and has earned Unesco Heritage status for preserving oral tradition. In Potos\u00ed, sip a bicentennial singani (Bolivia's answer to Peru's pisco). This strong spirit, now a symbol of national pride, is said to have started viticulture in the region in the 1500s in what was once a booming mining town \u2013 and Potos\u00ed still has the colonial architecture to prove it.\u00a0\nBolivia has the largest proportion of Indigenous people in South America, with roughly two-thirds of the population directly related to the area's original inhabitants. Bolivia's prettiest city, Chuquisaca (also called Sucre), where the declaration of independence was signed in 1825, is home to many Quechua peoples. While there, be suer to visit the Museo de Arte Ind\u00edgena for an up-close look at the country's ancient textile tradition. The Aymara people of the altiplano welcome visitors to the Isla del Sol (an island in the middle of Lake Titicaca) whose moonlike terrain makes for an incredible daylong hike. Elsewhere, a new network of community-based tourism brings attractions (and work opportunities) to these sometimes-remote communities, such as the Chalalan Ecolodge in the Amazon's Madidi National Park, where capybaras, cougars and macaws make their homes. \u2013 Laura Norkin\nBotswana has been hailed as Africa's leader in green safari tourism due to its expansive wildlife reserves and the government's focus on high-income, low-impact ecotourism policies; a strategy that has traditionally meant allowing fewer tourists. But as the country ushers in a new government and continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, its tourism sector (and sustainable cache) only stands to grow in 2025, with an increased demand for sustainable and culturally immersive travel experiences. In a bid to bolster tourism and strengthen the economy, Botswana has granted visa-free entry to visitors from 104 countries in recent years \u2013 including those from the US, UK, Germany and Canada. This means more travellers can now explore Botswana's natural beauty, including the \"Elephant Capital of the World\", Chobe National Park, and the Unesco-listed Okavango Delta; a vast wetland in the Kalahari Desert that is one of the world's last havens for cheetahs and the black rhinoceros.\nThe Okavango Delta will also see a number of new openings, including the 100% solar-powered Mbamba Camp in the delta's lagoon-and-savannah-dotted north, a luxury lodge offering a blend of comfort and family-friendly wildlife adventures that's slated to open in April 2025. Opening in May 2025 is Monachira Camp, where visitors can enjoy walking safaris, mokoro canoe rides and armchair safaris while coming face to face with elephants, lions and the Pel's Fishing Owl.\u00a0\u00a0\nStarting in April 2025, new Air Botswana routes will connect Gaborone to Cape Town, making it even easier for visitors to explore Botswana's magical nature for themselves \u2013 sustainably. \u2013 Eva Sandoval\n\"Is it even a city?\" a\u00a0recent viral ad for\u00a0Oslo, Norway\u00a0asked. The tongue-in-cheek video nodded to how overtourism has sullied other European capitals while showcasing the Norwegian capital's\u00a0extreme walkability;\u00a0world-class dining; and easy access to nearby fjords, islands and serene\u00a0postcard-perfect landscapes. Known for its modern architecture, sweeping waterfront and no shortage of trees (it's one of\u00a0Europe's most-forested cities), Oslo is luring the kinds of visitors who will do their part to ensure that it remains\u00a0one of the world's most sustainable cities.\u00a0\u00a0\nVisitors here are encouraged to refer to the\u00a0Visit\u00a0Oslo Responsibly guidelines and the\u00a0Green\u00a0Oslo Guide, which break down the concept of sustainable tourism into four categories: planet, people, prosperity and partnership. It's not unusual for hotels in the city centre to feature green roofs that produce food, reduce energy use, manage rainwater and support urban biodiversity.\u00a0\nTravellers can ensure their visit has a positive impact on residents and the local environment by supporting local businesses like the\u00a0Norwegian Adventure Company, which offers \"life-changing and sustainable experiences\" from its base in\u00a0Oslo, like kayaking through glacier-carved fjords, and chasing the Northern Lights.\u00a0After a long day of exploring the spectacular Nordic countryside, dine at one of the city's many farm-to-table restaurants,\u00a0like\u00a0the Michelin-starred\u00a0Maaemo, which utilises locally grown organic produce.\u00a0So, is it even a city?

        "article_text": "Across the UK, a collection of natural marvels reveal themselves at this time of year, including some of the rarest and most spectacular phenomena that the country has to offer.\nFor many Brits, the winter months \u2013 particularly once Christmas and New Year have passed \u2013 are all about hunkering down at home and waiting for the freeze to thaw. Across the British Isles, though, a collection of natural marvels reveals itself at this time of year, including some of the rarest and most spectacular phenomena that the country has to offer.\nFrom ghostly optical illusions to flocks of dancing birds, these British winter wonders are enough to encourage even the most ardent homebody to get their boots on, brush up on their photography skills and brave the big chill.\nAnimals changing their coats in the winter is a phenomenon often associated with polar species: the Arctic fox, Peary caribou and Canada's collared lemming, for instance. Less well known is that the British Isles have an animal of their own that dons a dashing white winter coat: the mountain hare.\nAlthough it is now vanishingly rare, this is Britain's only native hare \u2013 the brown hare, much more common today, was introduced to Britain by the Romans. England's only population of mountain hares lives in the Peak District, where the animal was reintroduced in the 1800s. They can be spotted in their snow-white winter coats between November and April, bathing in the pale sunlight in areas of moorland and heather. One of their favoured haunts is Bleaklow, a mountain along the Pennine Way atmospherically scattered with the wreckage of World War Two aircraft.\nThe largest concentration of mountain hares in the UK, though, is in the Scottish Highlands, where the animals can be spotted on sheltered slopes covered in thin snow, beneath which they dig for food. Mountain hares can be found all over the region, but a popular spot is the Monadhliath Mountains, southeast of Loch Ness. While you're there, look out for the mountain hare's avian equivalent: the ptarmigan. This plump, grouse-like animal is the only British bird that turns white in winter, and the UK's only population also lives in the Scottish Highlands.\nScotland is also one of the best places in the UK to spot another mountain phenomenon: the eerie Brocken spectre. Many a hillwalker has paused on a mountain trail and turned to admire a cloud-scattered view, only to be confronted with a huge, looming shadow figure, often with rainbow-coloured glory rings emanating from its head.\nThis creepy optical illusion is actually the walker's own shadow, magnified to enormous proportions. It appears when the Sun rises on one side of the walker and casts their shadow onto a blanket of cloud on the other side. As such, it is especially common during cloud inversions, when clouds gather in valleys below mountaintops, giving the impression of a soft white ocean. A light wind completes the spooky effect, making the spectre move as if it has a life of its own.\nThe Brocken spectre takes its name from the Brocken, a mountain in Germany where it is commonly observed, but it can be spotted in the right conditions in highland areas across the UK, from the Lake District to the Malvern Hills. The most storied spot to see it though is Ben Macdui, the highest peak in Scotland's Cairngorms Mountains and the second-highest mountain in Britain.\nSightings of Brocken spectres here are likely to have inspired the legend of the Big Grey Man (Am Fear Liath M\u00f2r in Scottish Gaelic) of Ben Macdui. The Grey Man matches the description of the Brocken spectre \u2013\u00a0a tall, thin shadow figure obscured by fog \u2013 though he is accompanied by the eerie added elements of the sound of crunching gravel and a general feeling of unease.\nMany people report feeling alarmed or unsettled by their experience of the Brocken spectre, and the symbolic quality of the phenomenon \u2013 its ability to terrify a person with nothing more than their own shadow \u2013 has been commented on by the likes of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and psychoanalyst Carl Jung.\nOne of the best loved phenomena in the world of birdwatching \u2013 and often described as Britain's greatest natural spectacle \u2013 is murmuration, the species-specific word given to the flocking behaviour of starlings. These small birds are very social animals, often roosting together in their thousands, and during the winter months they flock together to fly at dawn and dusk in remarkable swirling formations, like a synchronised dance troupe casting morphing silhouettes against the twilit sky.\nIt's thought that the flocking behaviour, much like shoaling of fish, serves the purpose of confusing predators as well as sharing warmth and communication. The name \"murmuration\" comes from the murmuring sound generated by the collective flap of the birds' wings, which can be impressively loud as they pass overhead. There's much that seems mysterious about murmuration, not least how the starlings do it without crashing into each other. The birds move in unison, but in incredibly complex patterns, as if they are tapped into a hive mind \u2013 but in fact, it's their incredibly quick reaction times that keep them from colliding.\nThere's something awe-inspiring about witnessing this ancient avian dance, which takes place at sunrise and sunset across the UK between November and February. Although murmurations happen inland too, coastal areas are particular hotspots. Aberystwyth, in west Wales, sees murmurations take place over its Victorian seafront pier \u2013 a picturesque juxtaposition of human engineering and natural wonderment that is a favourite of photographers.\nBritain is a densely populated island, and really dark night skies can be hard to find in built-up areas. In fact, according to Kielder Observatory in the north-eastern English county of Northumberland, \"85% of the UK population has never seen a truly dark sky or experienced the sense of wonder that a clear night filled with billions of stars can give.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Four of Europe's most fascinating pre-Christian winter festivals\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022 The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\nOutside the cities and towns, though, true darkness can still be found. Kielder Observatory sits in the second-largest area of protected dark sky in Europe, and holds several stargazing evenings each week in the winter months. The observatory is a remarkable construction in itself: a futuristic, boxy building made from local spruce and larch trees, looking like an organic spaceship that's crash-landed amid the dark conifers of Kielder Forest.\nNights at the observatory follow different themes, focusing variously on topics including the life cycles of stars, the planets of the solar system, and the night sky's great light show: the aurora. Traditionally, if Brits wanted to see the Northern Lights reliably, it meant booking a pricey holiday to the distant north: Finland, Sweden or somewhere else on the fringes of the Arctic Circle. In autumn 2024, however, the Sun entered a solar maximum, a period of heightened activity that brings the aurora out in vivid technicolour at more southerly locations than usual, including Britain. This period is expected to last for two or three years before gradually declining, and Northumberland \u2013 with its northerly latitude and dark night skies \u2013 is an excellent place to spot the Northern Lights.\nKielder is also home to one of England's only populations of red squirrel, the country's native squirrel, which is at risk of extinction thanks to the introduction of its cousin, the grey squirrel. Although red squirrels can be spotted year-round, they are very elusive, and the winter can be the best time to spot them, when their russet-coloured coats stand out more vividly against the blanket of snow.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "With her sultry drawl and feline charisma, the singer and actor oozed sophistication. But Eartha Kitt, who was born on 17 January 1927, had the toughest of childhoods. In History looks at how she transcended her troubled beginnings to become a star of stage and screen \u2013 and the first black Catwoman.\nCelebrated by Orson Welles as the \"most exciting woman in the world\", and smeared by the CIA as a \"sadistic nymphomaniac\", Eartha Kitt had an extraordinary life and career. After joining Katherine Dunham's pioneering African-American dance company, she was on Broadway by the age of 19, and went on to become a cabaret sensation in London and Paris. Her smouldering 1950s performances of songs such as Santa Baby, Just an Old-Fashioned Girl and I Want to be Evil have never been bettered. In 1967, she wowed mainstream television audiences as Catwoman in the third series of the camp classic Batman. Later, she won a new generation of fans as the villain Yzma in Disney's 2000 cartoon The Emperor's New Groove. She died on Christmas Day in 2008, aged 81.\nBorn Eartha Mae Keith on a South Carolina cotton plantation on 17 January 1927, she had a start in life that could hardly have been more difficult. She never knew her father, and her mother left her to be raised by various relatives. Speaking on BBC Wales' Late Call in 1971, she said: \"I remember at times when we didn't have anything to eat for what seemed like an insurmountable amount of time. We had to rely on the forest and whatever we could dig out of the ground, such as weeds or a grass I remember that had a kind of onion growing at the bottom of it. And when we could find things like that to eat then we were alright.\"\nDescribing her childhood self as an \"urchin\", she said: \"I'm very glad that she will always be a part of me because she helps me do what she knows I have to do out there on that stage.\"\nDespite being such a confident and poised performer, raw emotion was never far from the surface when Kitt was interviewed, as shown when Ronnie Williams, the host of Late Call, read her one of her quotes: \"You said, 'My mother gave me away at the age of five, and if my mother gives me away, she doesn't want me. So why should anybody want me?'\" Kitt replied that because of this abandonment, she had always lived with the feeling \"that the most important person in the world didn't want you\". She added: \"I think there are many explanations I can make for my mother giving me away and I think that, even though I have tried to explain within myself as to why she gave me away, it's still very difficult for me to accept it.\"\nDecades later, Kitt's beloved daughter Kitt Shapiro revealed that the singer died without knowing the identity of her white father. She told the Observer in 2013 that her mother wept when she finally saw her birth certificate, only to discover that the man's name had been blanked out by officials to protect his reputation in the segregated American South.\nBecause of her mixed heritage, Kitt told Williams on Late Call that she was not accepted by the black community. She said: \"They don't understand that I don't think of myself in terms of being a black person. I think of myself as being a person who belongs to everybody, but I think one should always feel this way. I think that, as long as you are feeling in terms of belonging only to one race, one nationality, one religion, that you have to be prejudiced\u2026 I am an illegitimate child, and at the same time I was not of completely black parentage. My father was supposedly a Caucasian, and my grandparents are Cherokee Indians. My mother was half black and all of this, and therefore my blood is of yours and of anybody's and therefore I've always thought of myself as this, and to be prejudiced against any of the other bloods is rather silly to me.\"\nIN HISTORY\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nAccording to Kitt, her travels had convinced her that financial inequality was at the root of so much prejudice around the world: \"When we are able to recognise that no matter what colour or religion you belong to, that you are capable of gaining as much as the next person can, no matter what race or religion he belongs to, I think the situation would be much healthier.\"\nThe singer and actor was being interviewed on BBC Wales to promote her week-long residency at the Double Diamond Club in Caerphilly, a scenic town near Cardiff. While the popular venue did in its time host big stars such as Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash, it was still a long way from Broadway.\nIn the US at that time, Kitt was cancelled. Her career had faltered following a White House luncheon in 1968 to discuss the causes of juvenile delinquency with Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of President Lyndon B Johnson. As protests against the Vietnam War raged across the US, Kitt's diagnosis of the problem's causes upset the genteel audience. She told the First Lady: \"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don't want to go to school because they're going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.\"\nIn response, the CIA compiled a dossier on her. The New York Times revealed in 1975 that this extensive report contained \"second\u2010hand gossip about the entertainer but no evidence of any foreign intelligence connections\". Asked in later years about the notorious \"nymphomaniac\" claim reported to be contained in the document, Kitt was supremely dismissive: \"What has that got to do with the CIA if I was?\"\nWhile her career back home was in the doldrums, she spent time in Britain touring provincial clubs. During one such residency at the distinctly unglamorous Batley Variety Club in West Yorkshire, a BBC reporter asked her how such a sophisticated celebrity could feel an affinity with local people there. She replied: \"I wasn't born in such a different world. I came out of extreme poverty. I have acquired things, yes. The things have not acquired me.\"\nIt wasn't until 1978, ten years after that White House incident, that Kitt made her triumphant Broadway return in the musical Timbuktu!. She remained a frequent visitor to Britain, often making outrageous appearances on television talk shows. Again, her vulnerability was never too far from the surface. In one spectacular 1989 BBC appearance, she began by resting her feet flirtatiously on the lap of host Terry Wogan. Just a few minutes later, she was confessing that her public persona was nothing like her private self.\nShe said: \"Mr Wogan, you know something? I'm not an extrovert. I can tease as 'Eartha Kitt', but as Eartha Mae? Forget it. I'm hiding behind the bushes, behind the chairs, behind everything I could possibly find to hide behind, because I've never had that kind of security within Eartha Mae that makes me feel that she will ever be accepted.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How a child star saved a Hollywood studio\n\u2022 Nina Simone on how fury fuelled her songs\n\u2022 Toni Morrison on her mission to please black fans\nKitt's abiding loves were her fans and her daughter. Having been abandoned by her own mother, Kitt insisted on bringing her daughter with her all over the world. Her marriage to businessman Bill McDonald in 1960 lasted less than four years, and she never remarried. Asked by Wogan if she had been reluctant to let her guard down, she said: \"A man has always wanted to lay me down, but he never wanted to pick me up.\"\nShe said that it was the love she received from adoring crowds that \"makes me feel that I really am a worthwhile person\". However, she also explained: \"When I go back to the dressing room, I take off the makeup and I'm not 'Eartha Kitt' anymore, I'm Eartha Mae again.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "In Lithuania\u2019s Dz\u016bkija National Park, losing yourself amongst the pine trees while hunting for mushrooms is an occurrence so common it has its own word: \"nugrybauti\".\nThe thickening canopy of trees swallowed the last trace of sunlight, and with it, our sense of direction. Lifting our gaze from the forest floor, we noticed that the surrounding woods \u2013 minutes ago a familiar landscape of sun-dappled clearings and winding tracks \u2013 had been replaced by an expanse of dense brown shadows, suddenly foreign and disorienting.\nOur guide Tom Baltu\u0161is, owner of the foraging tour company Dz\u016bkijos Uoga, had noticed it too. \"In Lithuania, we have a specific word for this sensation. Nugrybauti: lost in the forest whilst hunting for mushrooms.\"\nTo a nation so fixated with foraging, these woods in Dj\u016bkija National Park in southern Lithuania hold a particular allure. Just an hour's drive from the capital Vilnius, the park \u2013 Lithuania's largest \u2013 is blanketed by dense pine forests, concealing a sprawling tapestry of bogs, black alder swamps and smoky marshland. It's a protected landscape that supports an astonishing abundance and variety of edible mushrooms.\u00a0\nForaging has long been a cornerstone of local life here, and the practice \u2013 once a necessity but now a beloved pastime \u2013 has shaped the region's living habits, cuisine and economy over the centuries.\u00a0\nNow, Dj\u016bkija's estimated 300 varieties of edible mushrooms draw mycophiles from around the world to this quiet corner of the Baltics, joining locals on the hunt for some of Europe's largest, rarest and finest fungi amidst unending tracts of pristine forest.\nDj\u016bkija's unique soil composition was shaped thousands of years ago when ice age glaciers left behind vast sand deposits across the region. The moist, well-draining ground conditions that resulted provide the ideal environment for extensive fungal networks (mycelium) to thrive underground, exchanging nutrients with the park's millions of pine trees in a process known as ectomycorrhiza.\n\"It's a paradise for mushrooms, but this sandy, infertile soil made agriculture impossible here,\" Baltu\u0161is explains. \"We can only grow a small handful of crops, so the primary source of food and income has always been the forest. For centuries, families hunted, foraged for berries and collected mushrooms, which not only provided sustenance for themselves but also allowed them to sell forest produce to surrounding regions.\"\nRemnants of Dj\u016bkija's booming mushroom trade remain in isolated villages like Zervynos (pictured above), where locals once sourced, dried and cured the region's fungi to be sent to chefs and Soviet elites in Vilnius, Warsaw and St Petersburg. Gr\u016btas Park, located 40km to the west, is an exhibition of USSR-era monuments collected by Viliumas Malinauskas, Lithuania's \"Mushroom Millionaire\", whose business exporting Dz\u016bkija's mushrooms to the rest of Europe made him, for a time in the 1990s, one of the country's wealthiest men.\nToday, the dozens of cars dotting the highway, bonnets heavy with boxes of chanterelles, signal Dj\u016bkija's more modest mushroom trade. One roadside vendor, Agn\u0117, tells me that \"foraging was once a means of survival. Now, it's simply a way of life.\"\nGrybautojas (mushroom hunters) here are among Europe's most discerning, closely tracking rainfall, humidity and even the lunar cycle, believed by some to stir up groundwater and influence the fructification of their favourite varieties. Most pick more than they can eat, selling the excess to passing travellers.\u00a0\n\"Foragers in Dz\u016bkija know exactly how to find what they're looking for,\" said Baltu\u0161is, as we picked our way through a clearing. \"Porcini like to grow near white moss and oak trees; red-capped scaler stalks prefer birch groves; chanterelles enjoy growing among junipers.\"\u00a0\n\"And of course, every local keeps their favourite spots a sworn secret. If you ask anybody in Dj\u016bkija where to find the best mushrooms, they'll simply reply, 'In the forest'.\"\nBaltu\u0161is tells me that an estimated 300 varieties of mushrooms are consumed across Dj\u016bkija's dozens of villages and hamlets, and he lists them off as we wind through the trees. \"Chantarelles, milkcap, honey fungus, boletus, chicken of the woods.\" But pinning down an exact number is difficult, he adds, \"as some species considered poisonous elsewhere are often enjoyed by the park's most experienced foragers\".\nSpecies like honey fungus, considered mildly toxic in countries like Norway, are parboiled by some in Dj\u016bkija to safely consume in soups; whilst false morels \u2013 deep brown, wrinkled and often deadly when eaten raw \u2013 are among the first spring mushrooms prized by seasoned grybautojas in Dz\u016bkija, boiled intensively between three to five times to fully extract any toxins.\n\"The sheer abundance and variety of mushrooms here, along with the beautiful natural scenery, is what attracts enthusiasts from all over the world,\" says Regina Baltu\u0161ien\u0117, who co-owns Dz\u016bkijos Uoga with Tom, her partner.\nSpecialising in eco-tourism, they lead foraging excursions from their traditional hamlet homestead and offer expert guidance in safely hunting for baskets of Dj\u016bkija's wild mushrooms, hosting foragers from around the world to help them uncover the region's very best.\n\"Many guests coming to Lithuania are fascinated by our leisure activity,\" says Tom. \"In a globalising world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find traditions so specific to one particular region, but mushroom picking offers the perfect chance to experience Dj\u016bkija's culture and nature simultaneously\".\nAs mushroom season gets underway in late August, locals in Dj\u016bkija seize the opportunity to incorporate the park's fungi \u2013 whether dried, cured, crushed or powdered \u2013 into the country's most popular meat, fish and potato dishes before December brings foraging to an abrupt, frosty end.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The chefs reclaiming Lithuania's cuisine\n\u2022\u00a0The European region where young people are happiest\n\u2022\u00a0Are Lithuanians obsessed with bees?\nThe flavorful bavarykas mushroom is stuffed into cepelinai (parcels of thick potato dough); while gryb\u0173 sriuba (Lithuania's ubiquitous mushroom soup) and kugelis (potato pudding) take on Dj\u016bkija's abundant porcini and boletus. Butter-fried russulas, saffron milk caps and parasol mushrooms, with their distinctive meat-like flavour, are all popular appetisers.\n\"Here, everyone can freely pick mushrooms and berries, except in state-protected areas and territories,\" says Regina. The country's \"Right to Roam\" laws, based on the principle of \"everyman's right\" \u2013 the legal concept that argues that the wilderness ought to remain open to all for recreational activity \u2013 allow citizens to access natural resources, such as Dj\u016bkija's mushrooms and berries, even on private property, so long as the privacy of homeowners is respected.\n\"Indeed, in Lithuania, forest owners are required to allow everyone to pick mushrooms on their land,\" she adds.\n\"Mushroom picking is a part of life and identity for the residents of Dz\u016bkija, who have been foraging since childhood, learning about every species from their parents and grandparents,\" says Regina. Education centres in the regional hub of Var\u0117na, affectionately referred to as Dj\u016bkija\u2019s \"Capital of Mushrooms\", and the town's annual Mushroom Festival are part of an effort to keep the park\u2019s traditions alive, teaching younger generations about the cultural significance and lifestyle benefits of foraging.\u00a0\n\"If our mushroom-picking tradition is not preserved, the region will lose its identity and future generations will miss out twofold,\" Regina says. \"On both a wonderful pastime and the delicious dishes made from Dj\u016bkija's freshly gathered wild mushrooms.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The 'missing middle' of small businesses\n\u2022\u00a0Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love\n\u2022\u00a0Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things\nWhere do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?\nMy perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.\nI'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 set itself on a path to a new vision of green urban living.\nThe 1,000-year-old Swedish city of V\u00e4xj\u00f6 sits 450km south-west of Stockholm in the central region of Sm\u00e5land amid a lush tapestry of sylvan landscapes dotted by hundreds of lakes. This is a land known as the Glasriket (\"Glass Kingdom\") that's home to a string of globally renowned glassworks such as Kosta Boda and Orrefors who have created crystalline gorgeousness from fiery furnaces since the 1740s.\nBut that glassmaking heritage is now matched by changemaking: this compact city of fewer than 100,000 inhabitants has become a global beacon in the battle against climate change. Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 set itself on a path to a new vision of urban living that's now been emulated worldwide.\n\"It was a seminar in 1996 led by the mayor, which asked the question: 'What would it be like to live in a fossil free city?',\" explains Henrik Johansson, environmental strategist for V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Municipality. By the end of that meeting, a unanimous vote saw V\u00e4xj\u00f6 become the first city in the world to commit to become fossil fuel free. This has now evolved into a bigger target of climate neutrality by 2030 \u2013 15 years ahead of Sweden's nationwide commitment.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nV\u00e4xj\u00f6's groundbreaking 1990s commitment drew media coverage from as far afield as Japan, with TV crews ironically taking fuel-guzzling long-distance flights to visit the place Johansson wryly describes as \"this crazy town looking to go fossil free\". None of it seems crazy now, however, with V\u00e4xj\u00f6's per capita carbon emissions slashed by more than 70% \u00a0from 1990s levels, all while the city has grown in population by a third and doubled its per capita GDP.\nHere, local buses and council vehicles run on biofuel made from domestic household organic waste. More than 90% of the city's energy, meanwhile, is sourced from forestry by-products and other biomass, with plentiful material coming from the vast surrounding forests. This ranges from sawdust from local timber mills to branches left from tree-felling to make goods for IKEA \u2013 the global design giant born just a half hour train ride away in the town of \u00c4lmhult.\nThe few CO2 emissions that linger in the air stem from personal car users who are still not taking advantage of one of Sweden's best provisions of electric car charging stations, plus places to fill up on non-fossil biofuels such as ethanol.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe boldest transition, though, has seen V\u00e4xj\u00f6 become perhaps the world's leading showcase for large-scale timber architecture, with half of all new builds required to be in wood, sourced from the same sprawling forests that once provided fuel to fire the glasswork furnaces.\nI arrive in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 by train and can't help but start snapping pictures of a station interior unlike any I've ever seen. Stepping off the platform, I enter a seven-storey edifice that hosts both the Central Station and V\u00e4xj\u00f6 City Hall, and everywhere I look, there's wood. Here, timber is used for both structure and decor in a calm, soaring space that also includes a tourist office, exhibition area and eye-catching artworks made from pale wood. It's such a welcoming space that it's been nicknamed the city's public \"living room\".\u00a0\u00a0\nA wooden bridge connects the station with a museum quarter that I explore the next day, featuring the Swedish Glass Museum within the Sm\u00e5land Museum; plus the House of Emigrants, which tells the often revelatory story of Swedish mass emigration to North America.\nThe museum enclave is also home to myriad relocated buildings from past centuries \u2013 I particularly like the windmill as a symbol of ancient green power, built from timbers painted the iconic Swedish shade known as Falu or Falun Red, named after its historic source from mines around the eponymous town.\u00a0 \u00a0\nHeading down to the shore of Lake Trummen \u2013 one of two nearby lakes, along with sculpture-lined V\u00e4xj\u00f6sj\u00f6n \u2013 I potter along a trail of modern sculptures that provides a cultural promenade of contemporary works chosen and voted for by residents. Glass art is celebrated too, with contrasting crystalline creations placed along the cosmopolitan length of Sandg\u00e4rdsgatan that runs through the heart of the city centre to the iconic double-spired cathedral.\nPLAN YOUR TRIP\nHow to get there: A direct train from Copenhagen airport to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 takes 2.5 hours.\nWhere to stay: Modern design hotel PM & Vanner balances luxury with good eco practice.\nWhat to do\" Browse diverse brilliant glassworks dotted through the Sm\u00e5land countryside; head to the surprisingly inspirational IKEA Museum, and visit the lakeside medieval Kronoberg Castle five miles north of V\u00e4xj\u00f6.\nWhere to eat: The vintage decor at Kafe de Luxe celebrates stylish sustainable re-use. Galai offers upscale modern takes on superb Swedish produce in a chic, modern glass-box space.\nWhen to go: May-September for long days of Nordic sun and warmth.\nIt's a beautiful stroll, and I wonder whether people would have been so keen to leave Sweden if 19th-Century life had offered what the 21st-Century nation does. Alongside enviable public services and a famously equable society, I'm getting housing envy staring up at contrasting high-rise wooden apartment blocks that make up the award-winning Kvarteret Geologen residential complex (also known as Trummens Strand), standing tall and proud by the lake.\nHere, I'm joined by Olivia Thim, a sustainability expert for property management firm V\u00f6fab. \"For a long time, we had the tallest wooden building in Sweden,\" Thim says. \"But also a diversity: apartments, sports arenas, schools. We just thought that we should try to build everything in wood first.\"\nAlso with us is architect Karin H\u00e5rd Af Segerstad from leading V\u00e4xj\u00f6 practice Arkitektbolaget, who tells me about the super-strong cross-laminated timber (CLT) used for structural frames, augmented by cedar shaving facades and various interior woods. This swaddling in natural materials is as pleasing to the residents as it is to the eye, she says: \u201cPeople report an improved sense of well-being living surrounded by wood.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022\u00a0How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nFor architects and engineers, V\u00e4xj\u00f6's showcasing of innovative timber builds has been a valuable learning curve. \"People weren't so knowledgeable about wooden high-rise buildings, so we have close collaboration with the local university,\" says Segerstad. \"Every time there was a question, there would be research done.\"\u00a0\nThis includes sensors within buildings to record how the structures perform over years and changing seasons. \"Now we have researchers coming from around the world,\" she continues. \"Many from Austria and Germany, but also places in Africa such as Congo.\u00a0 We have become world pioneers to build in wood. Aesthetic principles are as important as ecological ones.\"\u00a0\nThe environmental drive underpinning V\u00e4xj\u00f6's modern wood architecture is matched by how the city powers its 21st century life. Exploring the city centre, I can see innovative new wooden structures next to historic clapboard buildings, many transformed into trendy shops or atmospheric restaurants, such as Kafe de Luxe where the traditional Swedish dishes rely on produce from the surrounding land and water.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe staying power of wood\nArkitektbolaget is building a new wooden Vias Chapel just outside the city that will provide a 21st-Century echo of Sweden's oldest wooden building, located 40km north of V\u00e4xj\u00f6. A visit to the 800-year-old Granhults Church proves not just the durability of wood, but also how well it works as a medium for art. An ornately painted interior is as ravishing in its own way as Rome's Sistine Chapel, while burnished medieval wooden carvings of various godly figures sit alongside humble timber furnishings.\nMeanwhile, at modern design hotel PM & Vanner, the restaurants focus on local, seasonal and organic dishes, including produce from the hotel's own garden \u2013 while dishes are cleaned using an energy- and water-saving dishwasher. Food waste is turned into biofuel, and the hotel is also part of an innovative textile recycling system.\nBefore I leave, I walk around the wood-decorated offices of local power generator VEAB with CEO Erik Tellgren, who tells me how forest and wood product \"waste\" taken from around V\u00e4xj\u00f6 easily provides all the electricity requirements of the city, in a manner that also helps the battle to mitigate climate change.\nCarbon Count\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 0.35 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\"Forest residues left to decompose generate CO2,\" says Tellgren. \"So, using it up helps cut emissions.\" And, he adds, the ash produced from the burned wood is returned to the forest floor as an excellent compost.\nHe smiles as he recalls how V\u00e4xj\u00f6's first power plant, which fired up here beside the lake in the 1880s, burned wood, and now some 140 years later, the town is again relying on the material as it leads the world away from fossil fuels\n\"So we began with wood, and now we come back to it again,\" he says.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Copenhagen's once-industrial port has been planned to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes.\nWhile cruising the canals of Copenhagen in the summer of 2023, my guide pointed out Nordhavn, the city's once-industrial neighbourhood, excitedly claiming it would become the coolest new city in Europe. From the boat, I couldn't see much beyond a few residential buildings and lots of giant construction machinery, but, as an architect, I was interested to know more.\nSo, 12 months later, I returned to Copenhagen and headed back to Nordhavn, just a 15-minute metro ride from Copenhagen's central station.\u00a0\nThis time, standing at \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, the core of the new development, I could see gleaming apartment buildings, high-end office spaces and a cafe-lined boardwalk along the previously industrial harbour. Dozens of people were lying on colourful beach towels spread across the waterfront, all soaking in the Scandinavian summer sun. It was a peaceful, serene scene, with none of the morning commuter chaos I was used to seeing in cities around the world.\nAnd that's because Nordhavn has been specifically designed to make life easier.\n\"Although it looks like any modern district, it's the world's first five-minute city,\" explained my guide, Bente Hoffman from immersive cultural tour company Slow Tours. \"When the project is complete, everything you need will be within a 400m walk.\"\nCommuting is one of the biggest challenges of modern life as it adds so much time into the daily routine. Nordhavn (officially a district of Copenhagen, but described as a city due to its scale and scope) has been designed to make everything \u2013 from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces \u2013 accessible within five minutes. It is setting a blueprint for a world where residents can fit in a morning workout before strolling to the office, grab lunch at a cute cafe, have a quick swim at the harbour and still make it home in time to take your kids to the playground \u2013 all before enjoying a cosy candlelit dinner at home.\nImagine doing all of this without driving from one point to another, without feeling exhausted, and being able to repeat it every day while staying carbon neutral.\n\"We are creating a neighbourhood that meets everyday needs and special occasions,\" explained Peter Bur Andersen, an architect from BRIQ Studios that played a crucial role in zoning Nordhavn. \"Everything is within walking or biking distance, minimising the need for commuting. The area also promotes a mostly car-free lifestyle, connected by cycle paths and the metro.\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nCopenhagen is currently the Unesco World's Architecture Capital (until 2026) and innovative solutions for smart living have been brewing across the Danish capital: from Paper Island, designed to focus on public spaces and housing for all income groups; to Carlsberg City District that's built on four pillars of beer production: science, innovation, art and culture.\nHowever, Nordhavn's five-minute city concept is unique. While there are a few 10-minute cities being developed around the world, including one in Seoul, South Korea, Nordhavn's one-of-a-kind concept is the most ambitious urban development project in Scandinavia. It is also the only new urban district anywhere in the world to receive a gold certification for sustainability from the German Sustainable Building Council, or DGNB (the largest network for sustainable building in Europe), according to Andersen.\nIn Nordhavn, sustainability is about more than reducing energy consumption. Every building constructed must consider its social, economic and environmental impact. For example, the Big Bio Cinema \u2013 the city's newest theatre \u2013 is constructed from recyclable materials such as aluminium in case the building ever needs to be demolished.\nTop tips:\nWhen to go: June-August for warmer weather.\nWhat to do: Take a guided walking tour. Explore the design shops in the harbour area. Head to Konditaget L\u00fcders, a carpark rooftop that serves as an open-air public gym. Watch a movie at Big Bio Cinema.\nWhere to stay: Audo House, a former warehouse transformed into a boutique hotel with a caf\u00e9 and concept store.\nWhere to eat:\n- Located on the 17th floor of a former grain silo, Restaurant Silo has impressive views and a seasonal menu.\n- Headed by Rosio Sanchez, a former dessert chef from Noma, Hija de Sanchez Cantina\u00a0is a two-minute walk from the Sandkaj Harbour.\n- Palmar\u00e8s Bike Caf\u00e9 is a unique spot for cyclists, offering coffee, croissants and a bike workshop, with bike parts as d\u00e9cor.\nAnd, according to Anderson, social and economic inclusion has been at the core of all planning. \"It is important to bring back what worked well in history,\" he said. \"We used to have the butcher, craftsman, baker and cheese shop \u2013 that diversity in everyday encounters. The future city should mix recreational, cultural and commercial spaces, all easily accessible within the neighbourhood.\"\nBut until relatively recently, no one would have considered living in this once-industrial district. Irshia Nasreen, an engineer born and raised in central Copenhagen, says, \"While I was trying to find a new neighbourhood to move out of the city centre, I never thought I'd move here.\"\nBente adds, \"I didn't think I would do tourist walks in Norhavn. There was nothing to see.\"\nAfter all, for centuries Nordhavn was a free port filled with cargo ships, grain silos and metal containers. The buildings that existed were warehouses and industrial shipping structures. Then, in 2008, a competition was held to create a sustainable neighbourhood for Copenhagen's future: 179 proposals were submitted and a group of four architectural firms, COBE Architects, Sleth, Ramb\u00f8ll and Polyform were winners.\nThey designed an urban area of \"soft mobility\", where it is easier to walk, bike or use public transport than it is to drive; and put the idea of hybrid spaces \u2013 something that \"avoids creating lifeless spaces and fosters community among residents, employees and visitors\", according to Andersen \u2013 at its heart. For example, in Nordhavn, a multi-storey car park might have a gym on its roof; an apartment building could include a public restaurant; and a hotel could house a concept store.\nAlthough the entire Nordhavn project won't be finished until 2060, it is being developed in islets (small islands), with key areas such as Nord\u00f8 and \u00c5rhusgadekvarteret, already complete and full of life, brimming with locals and tourists. A metro extension to Nordhavn and Orientkaj opened in 2020, providing easy access from the city centre.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0Kamikochi: Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n\u2022\u00a0How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nAs Hoffman and I walked through Nord\u00f8, I admired the ingenuity of using once-unassuming buildings to create chic destinations. Audo House, a warehouse from 1918, is now a boutique hotel, concept store and cafe. Across the road, MENY food supermarket was once a factory for building guns. Because of the building's protected status, MENY had to use the same walls, windows and ceilings as the former World War Two gun factory to create what is now a futuristic food market. Nearby, the raw steel surface of The Silo still resembled its days as a grain silo. But it has now been transformed into a luxurious 17-storey residential building with a public restaurant.\n\"The beauty of Nordhavn lies in the blend of old and new architecture standing side by side,\" said Hoffman. \"Sustainability is also about preserving the past by repurposing old buildings for modern use.\"\nNasreen moved to Nordhavn in 2023 and says the calm, car-free environment has transformed her lifestyle. \"I love walking around here,\" she said. \"After living in the city centre for 40 years, not hearing the hums of vehicles is refreshing. The proximity of water to all residential areas gives a sense of peace and fresh air. My nephew is awed by the fact that he can swim in the harbour, walk back home for a shower and then go back to the waterfront to enjoy coffee in a cool caf\u00e9. Isn't that amazing?\"\nCarbon emissions:\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 1.57 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nShe added: \"I work from home, and when I need a change of scenery, I head to The Audo House. It's a multifunctional space, so you see tourists checking in the hotel and people shopping for art and furniture while I have a coffee in its cafe on a winter afternoon.\"\nIn the early 20th Century, when legendary Danish designer Arne Jacobsen said, \"Architecture is not just about creating buildings; it's about shaping the environment and enhancing people's lives,\" it was theoretical. A century later, Hoffman is leading curious designers and architects like me on walking tours around Nordhavn. As curious as I am, and perhaps with the same intent, they are looking for answers to the question: can architecture be one of the keys to creating a happier urban environment?\u00a0\nFor Nasreen and many others living in Nordhavn, the answer is a resounding yes.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\nRuben Amorim (left) pictured in the Benfica boys' team along with friends Bruno Simao (second right) and Pedro Russiano (right)\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls. \n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago.

Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\nThis video can not be played\n'The second special one' - Amorim by those who know him\nSpecial One?

He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?' \n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\nAmorim (second left) with Professor Antonio Veloso (left) at the University of Lisbon \nThis video can not be played\nAmorim told he couldn't delay Man Utd move till summer\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia. \n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.' \n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\" \nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources. \n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\nAmorim's Portuguese Football Federation card when he did a coaching internship at Casa Pia\nAmorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\" \nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\" \nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\nUnited then spent about \u00a3600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one EFL Cup before he was sacked last month.\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\"The job is too big for him at the moment,\" England-based John said outside the Estadio Jose Alvalade. \"I don't think Ruben has had enough years here and he's also inheriting a lot of prima donna players at Manchester United.\n\"He's a great coach but he hasn't got enough experience.\"\nA poster in Sporting's club shop celebrating the 2023-24 title win \nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.\"\nA version of this feature was first published on BBC Sport on 2 November.\nEdited by Alice McKeegan\nAdditional reporting by Olga Monteiro\nA sticker of Ruben Amorim when he was at Benfica in 2014-15\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Opera star Bryn Terfel emerged from an extraordinary cultural heritage and a nation renowned for its love of singing. \"It's the air that we breathe,\" he explains in a new documentary.\nSir Bryn Terfel is pondering a question: what is it about Wales and the Welsh that produces a nation of singers? \"I think it's the mountains, and the fresh sea air. And the language \u2013 that is very important,\" he says. \"Then there's the hymns\u2026 You know, we just love to sing \u2013 it's the air that we breathe.\"\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eight of the most stunning opera houses\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The extraordinary 'lost' opera composer\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThe Welsh bass-baritone is the subject of Peak Performance, part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera. Presented by Zeinab Badawi, it follows Sir Bryn \u2013 as he has been known since his knighthood in 2017 \u2013 from his operatic debut with the Welsh National Opera in 1990, to singing at opera houses across the world, like London's Royal Opera House, where he is a regular star performer. En route, the documentary revisits his roots in rural Wales and looks at how he's nurturing the next generations of singing talent, as well as his invitation to sing at King Charles's coronation.\nSir Bryn is high on the list of great living Welsh opera singers, which also includes luminaries such as Dame Gwyneth Jones, Wynne Evans, Katherine Jenkins, and Aled Jones. (Added to which there are many popular non-opera Welsh singers, including Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, Bonnie Tyler, Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews.) But beyond these headline stars lies a whole nation renowned for its love of singing, especially choral. So where does this passion for song stem from?\nIn A History of Music and Singing in Wales, novelist and poet Wyn Griffith, who wrote extensively on Wales and Welsh culture, observed: \"If you find a score of Welsh people, in Wales or out of it, you will find a choir. They sing for their own delight, and they always sing in harmony. They sing as naturally and easily as they talk.\"\n\"Wales is known as a nation of music \u2013 the 'land of song',\" notes the Welsh National Opera (WNO). \"Often connected with male voice choirs, it is\u2026 recognised for its choral traditions which are rooted in the culture.\"\nChoral singing in Wales dates back to the 19th Century, and flourished with the Cymanafa Ganu (hymn singing) movement, at a chapel in Aberdare in 1859; it was rooted mainly in religious songs, though a steady body of secular songs were also produced. Soon after, a revival of traditional Welsh music began with the formation of the National Eisteddfod Society, a focus for the Welsh passion for singing and song. Any worthy list of classic Welsh songs might include Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (O Land of My Fathers); My Little Welsh Home by William Sidney Gwynn Williams; and the love song Ar Lan y Mor (recorded by both Terfel and Jenkins). Or the rousing We'll Keep a Welcome (In the Hillsides).\nThe male voice choir, along with the harp, are two of the most popular signifiers of Welsh music. Professor Gareth Williams traces the male voice choir's origins to the mid-19th Century industrial age: \"We are reminded of what Aneurin Bevan once said: 'Culture comes off the end of a pick',\" he writes, referring to Welsh coal miners. Choirs started in the 1920s, like Cwbach from the Cynon Valley, and Pendyrus, survive today. After a day's hard graft in a mine, says Williams, the joy and community found in singing with co-workers was \"an assertion of working-class male bonding and identity expressed through that most democratic and inexpensive instrument, the human voice\".\nThe Welsh Borough Chapel in Southwark, London, is host to Eschoir, a Welsh male choir of around 20 singers, aged 20 to 75. Singing together since 2009, they've performed at Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Eschoir founder and director Mike Williams, who grew up in south Wales, describes their appeal: \"There's a humility to it, as Welsh choirs stem back to the coal mines and chapels. Many people enjoy singing in the pub as much as singing in a concert. There is no pomp\u2026 it unites us and keeps us connected to our Welsh roots.\" And the Welsh take choirs very seriously, he adds.\nIn tandem with a passion for choral singing in Wales, there has been a rise in popularity of the Eisteddfod. These Welsh singing and recital competitions date back to the 12th Century and today are a platform for public singing, especially for younger singers. It was at local Eisteddfods that the young Bryn Terfel first stood out, winning singing competitions that would lead him to study at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and to his first professional role in Cosi Fan Tutti at Welsh National Opera, soon after graduating in 1989.\nA unique cultural inheritance\nIn the documentary, Terfel recalls competing in Eisteddfods in his rural north Wales, and how his \"parents paid for a lot of petrol to drive me north, south, east and west to compete. They saw something in their son\u2026 the passion, how I loved singing. I think that drove them to encourage the singing within me.\" Eisteddfods are \"a wonderful shop window\", he says. One of his charitable initiatives is a scholarship to develop promising young performers coming up through Eisteddfods. Peak Performance visits one in Llanadog, near Swansea, as young singers of all genders, from the area and across Wales, prepare to get on stage and sing. \"This is where it all starts for us Welsh singers,\" says one teenage boy in the documentary. \"This is where we learn our craft.\" He believes when Welsh singers go to London to study, \"you can see the difference\u2026 they\u2019ve got some sort of\u2026 confidence.\"\nCertainly, Terfel was swaddled in song and music from the cradle. Born in 1967 in rural north Wales, his father was a farmer, his mother a special needs teacher who used music therapy in her work. The whole family, including older relatives, sang together and in choirs. \"My grandfather, my great-grandfather, had the love of singing,\" he says. \"There was constant learning going on in the kitchen, words on the cabinets. A little bit of rivalry as well, which is quite healthy.\"\nEilir Owen Griffiths, a composer and Eisteddfod adjudicator, explains what he looks for in a great singer: \"It's how the voice resonates, and the way it works with text.\" He describes Terfil's voice as \"like a beautiful double bass\" \u2013 but it's not just the incredible sound he generates: \"It's also the control he has \u2013 he can sing the most delicate pianissimo as well. It's a unique voice, very special.\" That quality \u2013 and cultural diversity \u2013 was drawn on when Sir Bryn sang at the coronation of King Charles, who personally chose him to perform; he sang Coronation Kyrie, a first in the Welsh language at a coronation. \"You have the rehearsals in the rooms\u2026 Then you have your fittings, and all of a sudden you're in your costume and make-up.\" And you're onstage, he says, \"portraying a character. And that's when the fun really does begin!\"\nThe documentary joins Terfel as he goes through his repertoire for a week in March: as well as the Barber of Seville at the Royal Opera House, he sings the title role in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool; then travels to a studio near Cardiff in Wales, to record an album of sea shanties \u2013 the likes of Drunken Sailor, and traditional folk songs like Fflat Huw Puw, \"about a sailor and his wonderful ship\".\nIt's a voice that continues to thrill audiences, whether in lead roles such as Mozart\u2019s Don Giovanni at the Royal Opera House; or Tosca by Puccini at Paris Opera Bastille; or Verdi's Falstaff, at Grange Park Opera, Surrey. As well as big opera houses, he performs for new audiences in concert halls too. Gillian Moore is artistic director of the South Bank Centre, where in recent months he sang extracts from two of Wagner's great roles: \"The fact he's passing that on to young singers makes total sense\u2026 When he's on stage, you cannot take your eyes off him.\"\nReturning to that question of why the Welsh love to sing, Wyn Griffith suggests it's about an irrepressible spirit \u2013 and it's simply in the blood: \"Whether they meet in tens or in thousands, in a small country chapel or in a vast assembly\u2026 they sing freely\u2026 It is not necessary to organise singing in Wales: it happens on its own.\"\nTake me to the Opera: Peak Performance is on BBC News Channel on 10 June at 13.30 and also on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn\u2019t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like Jos\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico \u2013 New Spain \u2013 were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.\u00a0 \n \n - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder\n \n -\u00a0The world\u2019s most mysterious silver cups\n-\u00a0How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence\nThe ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi \u2013 the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years \u2013 is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.\nArchaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account.\nArchaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The a\u00f1il plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn\u2019t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue\u2019s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the a\u00f1il plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered.\nRhapsody in blue\nMaster painters from the Americas are discussed in art history \u2013 if they\u2019re mentioned at all \u2013 as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Ju\u00e1rez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico\u2019s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Ju\u00e1rez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale \u2013 and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Ju\u00e1rez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens\u2019, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue \u2013 if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Ju\u00e1rez died in poverty.\u00a0 If Ju\u00e1rez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe?\nOn the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' \u2018fear of space\u2019 \u2013 the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident \u2013 thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result \u2013 the same as his peers in Mexico \u2013 was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.\nBaltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as \u2018El Echave de los azules\u2019 (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home.\nThe lack of written evidence of the use of a\u00f1il or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren\u2019t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from a\u00f1il by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries.\nThis cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Marcel Duchamp\u2019s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart \u2013 and at its 17th-Century predecessor.\nThis year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history \u2013 a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.\nMore like this:\n- When the Parthenon had dazzling colours\n- The insect that painted Europe red\n- The subversive power of the pipe\nThe work in question is awkwardly proportioned \u2013 over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall \u2013 and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um\u2019, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m\u2019ennuies, or \u2018you bore me\u2019) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making \u2013 found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel \u2013 that he christened \u2018readymades\u2019.\nIn stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, \u201cDuchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.\u201d Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.\nAnyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these \u2018readymade\u2019 swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp\u2019s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp\u2019s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp\u2019s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues \u2013 a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades \u2013 a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp\u2019s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of \u2018A. Boogert\u2019 \u2013 a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert\u2019s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel\u2019s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author\u2019s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp\u2019s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert\u2019s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp\u2019s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life\u2019s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
