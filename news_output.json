        "article_text": "When a prominent Saudi trans woman posted her suicide note on X, her friends and followers were devastated. The note, viewed by millions, said a lawyer in the US - where she had been trying to claim asylum - had persuaded her into returning home to a family and country that would not accept her identity.\nThe BBC World Service has identified this man as Bader Alomair, who has worked at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, evidence suggests. He is linked to controversial returns from the United States of several other Saudi students - including two later accused of committing murder during their time at university.\nMr Alomair has not responded to the allegations raised in our investigation.\nEden Knight was from one of the Middle Eastern kingdom's most respected families. After moving to Virginia in 2019 on a Saudi government scholarship to study at George Mason University, Eden made the decision in early 2022 to transition from presenting as a man to presenting as a woman, by wearing feminine clothes and taking female sex hormones.\nEden found a community on X and Discord where she felt accepted and started to grow a following online. In one post, she shared a picture of her Saudi ID photo next to her new feminine look and the post went viral.\nBeing transgender in Saudi Arabia is not tolerated by either society or the government - we have spoken to several transgender Saudis, now living outside the kingdom, who told us about the harassment, and in some cases violence, they had experienced.\nReturning to Saudi Arabia could therefore have been difficult for Eden. We understand her student visa expired at around the time of her viral tweet so she decided to seek asylum in the US in order to stay there permanently.\nEden said she was messaged by an old friend who put her in contact with an American private investigator Michael Pocalyko. He offered to help with her asylum claim, and mend the relationship with her family - according to another friend, Hayden, who Eden was living with in Georgia at the time.\nOther friends have shared messages with us from Eden, which say Mr Pocalyko told her she needed to move from Georgia to Washington DC in order to lodge her claim.\nAccording to the final message she posted on X, in late October 2022, the private investigator met Eden off the train in the US capital. He was accompanied by a Saudi lawyer named Bader, she wrote.\n\"I genuinely was optimistic and believed this could work,\" Eden said in her final post. She said Bader put her up in a nice apartment near Washington DC and took her sightseeing.\nBut over time it seems she began to question his motives. Eden wrote to friends, in messages shared with the BBC, that Bader was \"detransitioning\" her. She told them that Bader tried to throw out all of her feminine clothing and told her to stop hormone therapy.\nEden also told friends that Bader advised her she could not apply for asylum in the US and that she must return to Saudi Arabia to do this. A US immigration expert said such advice would be incorrect.\nIn December 2022, Eden messaged friends to say: \"I am going [back to Saudi] with a lawyer and wishing for the best.\" Her suicide note on X makes clear that the lawyer in question was someone called \"Bader\".\nIt was not long before Eden was telling friends that returning was a mistake.\nShe messaged them to say her parents had taken her passport and the government had instructed her to close her X account. Eden told friends she had evidence her parents had hired people to get her back to Saudi Arabia, though she never shared that evidence.\n\"The lawyer that was helping me with asylum was working with my parents behind my back,\" she told one of them.\nOver the next few months, Eden's friends say, she lost any hope of escaping Saudi Arabia.\nShe worked in a junior position at a tech company and in public assumed her original male identity. Eden messaged a friend to say she was trying to continue taking female hormones, but that her parents repeatedly confiscated them. Eden told friends that she suffered constant verbal abuse, and sent the friends a video - which we have seen - that she secretly recorded of a family member shouting that she had been brainwashed by Western ideas.\nEden took her own life on 12 March 2023.\nWe wanted to find \"Bader\" - the lawyer who Eden accused of detransitioning her and persuading her home, to ask him more about the events running up to her death. \nWe searched for lawyers of that name in the DC area, and one came up: Bader Alomair. There was limited information about him online, but an outdated directory for professionals working in Riyadh gave his full name in Arabic - which in turn led us to an inactive Facebook account showing a photo of him at Harvard Law School.\nIn texts Eden sent to friends, she mentioned her lawyer had been Harvard-educated.\nThen, a source shared a crucial photo - taken by Eden from the apartment Mr Alomair had installed her in. We were able to geolocate it to a residential block on the outskirts of Washington DC.\nOne person there told us he had known Eden and had seen her with Mr Alomair.\nHe said Eden owned feminine clothing, jewellery and make-up, but would have to hide it when Mr Alomair came over. He made her cut her hair and told her not to shave, the witness said.\nWe repeatedly tried to contact Mr Alomair, but he did not respond. When we visited the address listed on his DC Bar registration, we saw a man matching photos of him get into an SUV and drive away.\nWe followed, noting the car's unusual number plate - its code indicated the car was issued by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, and that the vehicle's owner was embassy staff.\nMr Alomair's role in the embassy was to support Saudi students in the US - a lawyer who previously worked with him told us.\nWe discovered news articles highlighting instances of Mr Alomair helping those left homeless by a hurricane in Florida, for example. But we also discovered his assistance had extended to more controversial situations.\nOn 13 October 2018, two Saudi students were questioned by US police over the death of an aspiring rapper in North Carolina - stabbed, reportedly after an altercation with the pair.\nSome two months later, Abdullah Hariri and Sultan Alsuhaymi were charged with murder, but by then had left the US.\nJust four days after the stabbing, Mr Hariri was on a flight back to Saudi Arabia, an email shared with us suggests. It includes details of the flights home which our source told us Mr Alomair organised for both Mr Hariri and Mr Alsuhaymi.\nNeither student has ever commented publicly on the case.\nMr Alomair was sent an invoice for the flights a month later, another email shows, which our source says he would have needed to get reimbursement from the Saudi embassy.\nAnother source says he has worked with him to represent dozens of other Saudi students in the US against charges ranging from speeding to drink-driving.\n\"Bader would come to the meetings with an Arabic form headed by the Saudi embassy for students to sign [which] promised to pay back legal fees to the Saudi government once they returned home.\"\nThe source told us the students would appear at their first hearing but vanish before any subsequent hearings, though we do not know if Mr Alomair had any role in this.\nIn 2019, the FBI warned that Saudi officials likely facilitated the escape of Saudi citizens from US legal proceedings.\n\"The FBI assesses that Kingdom of Saudi Arabia officials almost certainly assist US-based Saudi citizens to avoid legal issues, undermining the US judicial process. This assessment is made with high confidence.\"\nSources have told us Mr Alomair continues to live and work in the US. He owns multiple commercial properties around Washington DC and in August 2024 appears to have set up a new law firm in Virginia, where he is a named partner.\nMichael Pocalyko, Bader Alomair and the Saudi embassy in Washington DC did not respond to our questions.\nWe contacted Eden's family to ask if they wanted to take part in this story but they did not respond.\nBBC 100 Women names 100 inspiring and influential women around the world every year.

Racism remained the most reported form of discrimination, with a 47% rise in abuse across all levels.\n\"These are footballers, but they're [also] real human beings, and when you see the abuse that they face, it's just totally unacceptable,\" said Okafor.\n\"We did a research with 1,500 women fans, and one in four still feel unsafe going to games. 52% said they experienced sexism within a stadium. So there's still a huge amount of cultural work to do to make the game more inclusive.\n\"People are feeling more freedom to share their toxic and discriminatory abuse online, in particular.\"\nBut rules in the 2023 Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show they are removing illegal content, with the platforms given until March to implement measures or face fines.\n\"We believe that's going to give the regulator more powers to be able to hold the social media firms to account, as well as providing better user-empowerment tools,\" said Okafor.\n\"This is really important, because you can see the impact it has. So this is a real opportunity to tackle that. It can be a real game changer.\"\nTech giant Meta recently announced it is abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram, to the dismay of campaigners against hate speech online.\n\"That really does trouble me,\" said Okafor. \"That really does make the job harder.\n\"And that's why we need the regulators to use their powers to really hold social media firms to account, and to issue those penalties.\"\nIn 2020, the FA launched a voluntary Diversity Code in a bid to tackle racial inequality in the English game.\nHowever, only 53 clubs signed up to provide data on their workforce annually, and collectively they failed to meet any of the eight recruitment targets.\nHaving admitted that progress had been \"slower than hoped\", the FA has made it mandatory for all professional clubs in the English game to provide full diversity workforce data on age, sex, gender, ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation within their organisation by June.\n\"We've been calling for this for a number of years,\" said Okafor.\n\"It may feel uncomfortable, but other industries do this on a regular basis, so it's football just trying to catch up to where it should be in terms of bringing the data into the light.\n\"The more crucial step is what happens when the data comes out.\n\"I'm really interested in seeing - do clubs reflect their communities? If they don't, there's an opportunity to ensure that they've got the relevant plans.\n\"What you can see there is clearly a lack of black coaches, of South Asian representation within football. There is a lack of diversity when it comes to match officials, in terms of boardrooms.\"\nOkafor says clubs should face fines if they fail to publish the data.\n\"We're very hopeful that all the clubs will have published their data,\" he added.\n\"And if not, then we'll be expecting that there should be a level of consequence as a result.\n\"This is certainly not about league tables or naming and shaming clubs.

        "article_text": "Israeli troops have withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor - a military zone cutting off the north of the Gaza Strip from the south.\nHundreds of Palestinians in cars and on carts laden with mattresses and other goods began returning to northern Gaza following the pull-out - often to scenes of utter destruction. \nThe Israeli withdrawal is in line with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement of 19 January under which 16 Israeli hostages and 566 Palestinian prisoners have so far been freed.\nBy the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead.\nHamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, triggering the Gaza war.\nAt least 48,189 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says.\nOn Sunday, crowds of Palestinians were seen traversing the Netzarim Corridor - mostly moving north to see what had happened to their abandoned homes.\n\"What we saw was a catastrophe, horrific destruction. The [Israeli] occupation destroyed all the homes, shops, farms, mosques, universities and the courthouse,\" Osama Abu Kamil, a resident of al-Maghraqa just north of Netzarim, told the AFP news agency.\nThe 57-year-old, who had been forced to live for more than a year in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, said he now planned to \"set up a tent for me and my family next to the rubble of our house\".\n\"We have no choice,\" he added.\nMahmoud al-Sarhi, another displaced Palestinian, told AFP that for him \"arriving at the Netzarim Corridor meant death until this morning\".\nHe said this was \"the first time I saw our destroyed house\", referring to his home in the nearby Zeitun area.\n\"The entire area is in ruins. I cannot live here,\" he added.\nAbout 700,000 residents of northern Gaza fled to southern areas at the start of the war, when the Israeli military issued mass evacuation orders before launching a ground invasion of the Palestinian territory. \nMany of those displaced were subsequently forced to move multiple times after Israeli forces pushed into southern Gaza, too.\nThey were also prevented from returning to their homes through the Netzarim Corridor, stretching from the Gaza-Israel border to the Mediterranean Sea.\nIsraeli forces partially withdrew from the west of the corridor last month and the first Palestinians - pedestrians - were allowed to walk along the coastal Rashid Street as they crossed into northern Gaza. \nThose on vehicles have to use Salah al-Din Street and undergo screening for weapons by US and Egyptian security contractors.\nThe Israel Defense Forces have not officially commented on Sunday's withdrawal from the eastern part of the corridor, which will leave it in control of Gaza's borders, but not the road that had cut it in half.  \nThe Haaretz newspaper says the Hamas-run Gaza interior ministry has been urging people to \"exercise caution and adhere to the existing movement guidelines for their safety\".\nThe troop withdrawal comes as an Israeli delegation is expected to fly to Qatar which has been moderating talks between the two sides in the Gaza war.\nThe Israeli government has previously said the delegation will initially discuss \"technical matters\" regarding the first phase of the ceasefire deal, rather than the more challenging second phase which is meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the exchange of all remaining living hostages in Gaza for more Palestinian prisoners and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. \nThat will require further direction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently became the first foreign leader to meet US President Donald Trump since his return to the White House. \nDuring the trip, in the most dramatic shift in US policy regarding Gaza in decades, Trump called for the removal of the territory's entire civilian population and the development of what he called \"The Riviera of the Middle East\".\nConvening his first cabinet meeting since returning to Israel over the weekend, Netanyahu said Trump had come up with a \"completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel\".\n\"A revolutionary, creative vision - and we are discussing it,\" he was quoted as saying in an official readout of the meeting. \"He [Trump] is very determined to carry it out. It also opens up many possibilities for us.\"\nTrump's proposal, which would be a crime under international law, has been almost universally rejected, including by Arab states. \nThe Saudi foreign ministry said on Saturday that it would not accept \"any infringement on the Palestinians' unalienable rights, and any attempts at displacement,\" accusing Israel of \"ethnic cleansing\".\nEgypt has also rejected any idea of the removal of the Palestinian population and has said it is calling an emergency summit of the Arab League on 27 February to discuss what it called \"serious\" Palestinian developments.",

        "article_text": "He's an expert on all of NOLA's iconic foods but has a special place in his heart for gumbo. Here are his favourite bowls \u2013 from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine \u2013 unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\u00a0\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of\u00a0Acadian\u00a0descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\u00a0\nThe SpeciaList\nEmeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a\u00a0YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of\u00a0opinions on the\u00a0right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game \u2013 or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra \u2013 a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse \u2013 famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live \u00a0\u2013 has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo \u2013 served over rice \u2013 Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant, Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit\u00a0since\u00a0the space first opened in 1990. \"It used to be made with seafood,\" he says, \"then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.\"\nIt's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the\u00a0presentation\u00a0has too. \"The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,\" he says, \"that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux.\" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.\nHere are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.\nCommander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.\nPo'boys\nPo'boys (sometimes also written \"poor boy\") are one of NOLA's classic sandwiches \u2013 meats or seafood stuffed into crisp, light French bread. Lagasse's favourite? The po'boys at Domilise's. Inside the little yellow house on Annunciation Street, customers can choose from a whole menu of classic po'boys,\u00a0but Lagasse's top picks are fried shrimp, fried oysters or roast beef. \"You need about 20 napkins to eat the roast beef po-boy. It's soaked in gravy on NOLA-style French bread,\" he says. \"People debate whether to get it dressed\u00a0or not. I go for the dressed\u00a0po'boy, with\u00a0lettuce, tomato and pickles.\"\nIn the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct\u00a0blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of \"haute Creole cuisine\", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo.\u00a0\nEven though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. \"Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,\" he says.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.commanderspalace.com/\nAddress: 1403 Washington Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: +1 504-899-8221\nInstagram: @commanderspalace\nCaf\u00e9 Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.\nLagasse's Insider Tips\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde\u00a0in the French Quarter is iconic but crawling with tourists; locals get their hot sugar-dusted beignets at Caf\u00e9\u00a0du Monde's other location on\u00a0Dreyfous Drive\u00a0instead.\u00a0\nAnd for Lagasse, NOLA's best fried chicken comes from\u00a0Popeye's Chicken, the international fast food chain, founded in New Orleans in 1972. \"I don't know why, it's the same formula. But I think NOLA has the best Popeye's fried chicken, no matter which one you go to.\"\u00a0\nWhile most of the hundreds of interns who have been through the 14-week programme go on to work in restaurants, others become nurses, mechanics, technicians and more. What's consistent is that they all learn to cook classic New Orleans fare like red beans and rice, po'boys and gumbo. \"Caf\u00e9 Reconcile's chicken and sausage gumbo has a rich roux with lots of okra,\" says Lagasse, \"and it always hits the spot.\" It's a win-win, according to Lagasse. \"Your meal helps support the workforce development,\" he says. \"What could be better?\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://cafereconcile.org/\nAddress: 1631 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70113\nPhone: +1 504-568-1157\nInstagram:\u00a0@cafereconcile\nKnown as the Queen of Creole cuisine, chef Leah Chase was the heart behind legendary Dooky Chase Restaurant, first opened\u00a0in 1941 by\u00a0her in-laws and later evolving into a meeting place for excellent food, music and dialogue.\nJambalaya\nWhen Lagasse craves jambalaya \u2013 a rice dish cooked with a variety of proteins \u2013 he goes to one of two places for what he defines as the best: \"one that's not too dry and not too wet.\" The first is Toups' Meatery where the jambalaya is prepared with chicken and smoky andouille sausage. He also likes the jambalaya at Dooky Chase, which includes three kinds of pork, such as smoked ham, smoked chorizo and sausage. \"In the city of New Orleans, jambalaya is primarily made in a Creole style, so you'll often find tomato in it, but out in the country there's no tomato\".\nIn the upstairs dining room, many influential leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr and the Reverend\u00a0A L Davis, met to discuss crucial issues affecting the African American community.\nStarting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday),\u00a0Chase would\u00a0cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens.\u00a0\"They do a traditional style of gumbo,\" explains Lagasse, \"but during Lent it has lots of greens \u2013 mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens\u00a0and okra, and it's finished with gumbo fil\u00e9.\"\u00a0\u00a0For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted\u00a0New Orleanians from all over the city.\u00a0Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar \"Dook\" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition. Some say it is the best in New\u00a0Orleans.\nWebsite: https://www.dookychaserestaurants.com/\nAddress: 2301 Orleans Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119\nPhone: +1 504-821-0600\nInstagram: @dookychaserestaurant\nFamily-owned since 1919, Casamento's on Magazine Street is primarily known for its briny Gulf Coast oysters, which peak during cool autumn and winter months. \"Locals love to go there whenever they see the open sign, which is only when the oysters are great,\" says Lagasse. He enjoys eating the plump oysters alongside their much-loved seafood gumbo, which is replete with shrimp, tomatoes and okra. Other Casamento's must-haves include their oyster stew and sandwiches, made with their signature \"pan bread\" instead of traditional French bread.\nWebsite: https://casamentosrestaurant.com/\nAddress: 4330 Magazine Street, New Orleans, LA 70115\nPhone: +1 504-895-9761\nInstagram: @casamentosrestaurant\nChef Frank Brigtsen also started his culinary career as an apprentice under Paul Prudhomme, who helped him and his wife Marna open\u00a0Brigtsen's\u00a0in 1986 in NOLA's Riverbend\u00a0neighbourhood, where he serves classic\u00a0Cajun-Creole cuisine.\u00a0\n\"Frank is an excellent cook,\" says Lagasse, \"and I really like his fil\u00e9 gumbo, which is Cajun-style, meaning it has no tomatoes.\" Cajun gumbo also doesn't include okra. Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with fil\u00e9 powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. \"The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,\" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour. This cuts the cooking time significantly and yields a deep, complex flavour.\u00a0\nWebsite:\u00a0https://brigtsens.com/\nAddress: 723 Dante Street, New Orleans, LA 70118\nPhone: +1 504-861-7610\nInstagram:\u00a0@frankbrigtsen\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Dutch linguist Leonie Cornips has become fascinated with how cows communicate. But can this really be called 'language'?\nLeonie Cornips was long overdue for her coffee break. The chilly autumn air made a hot drink feel enticing. But Cornips was busy. She was a couple of hours into her work with a small herd of dairy cows. If she left now, she would lose something that would take time to recover. Cornips and the herd had entered a delicate, shared space she calls \"the rhythm of the cow\".\u00a0\nCornips is a sociolinguist at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scholars who pass through the institute's ornate doorway usually specialise in the study of Dutch language and culture. The soft-spoken researcher earned her academic laurels in the 1990s, and she still studies variations in syntax between different dialects in the Netherlands. But in addition to this, Cornips' work has more recently taken what professionals in the field call \"the animal turn\".\nFor years, Cornips has spent her summer holidays on a farm. She was struck from the start by the different personalities of individual cows. She read an essay by a philosopher that asked why linguists never study animals. It affected her deeply. Cornips felt that cows had the intelligence and social habits to be good research subjects for a linguist. As a Dutch person, she also knew they were cultural icons in a nation with a passion for cheese. So she turned her professional skills to cows.\nHumans have assumed for centuries that the ability to use language is a measure of our superiority. There is even an academic term for it: \"logocentrism\", meaning those who use words (from the Greek logos, meaning \"word\" or \"reason\") occupy a privileged position. Language, say many linguists, is what makes us human. Animals may grunt, bark or chirp, but they do not possess anything that counts as language.\nCornips is using her work with dairy cows to push back on this idea. It extends half a century of effort that began with Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees and Roger Payne's recording of humpback whales in the 1960s in an effort to show that humans may not be as linguistically unique as we had assumed.\nMany of Cornips' colleagues were sceptical when she suggested they apply the framework of linguistics to animals.\n\"The problem is people have no clear idea about language,\" she says. \"When they talk about language, they always refer to what comes out of the mouth.\" But after spending six years thoroughly immersed in the lives of cows, Cornips thinks that language is better understood as \"distributed\" between the mouth, body and surroundings, making it embodied, multi-modal and sensory. \"I'm eating with the cows, touching, kissing, walking, hugging,\" she says.\nMost research on cow language tend to focus on sounds. A 2015 study in the Netherlands, for example, looked at the pitch of cow sounds to see if they correlated with behaviours and concluded this could be a way to determine their welfare. And a 2019 Australian study found cows not only have distinctive individual vocalisations, but maintain these distinctive calls across a variety of contexts.\nCornips and the farmers she recruits to assist her record the frequency, duration and intensity of the sounds cows make. But she also focusses on the other ways meaning is expressed among bovines. Her methods are often ethnographic, a way of studying cultures that relies strongly on observation by the researcher. Cornips carefully observes cow behaviours and interactions alongside sound to determine how they communicate. \"I notice with cows that the body is an instrument to get to know the other,\" she says. Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".\nCows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says. This became obvious with Piet, a young male Fleckvieh from an intensively managed indoor facility who Cornips brought to join five other cows in an outdoor pasture.\u00a0\n\"I was always so happy to see him, that when I got into his meadow, I walked straight towards him and tried to touch him immediately,\" Cornips says. When she did so, Piet would back away.\nCornips gradually came to understand the need to respect Piet's personal space, as she might with a fellow human. She learned to keep her arms by her sides and only use eye contact intermittently, taking turns with Piet to look at each other and then look away. \"It took me quite a while,\" she says. \"I was very stupid. They are teaching me how to connect to them.\" Cornips realised she had to learn an etiquette. Without patience and attention, she says, you would never see it.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The scientists learning to speak whale\n\u2022\u00a0The sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet' revealed by AI\n\u2022\u00a0Is there something special about the human voice?\nPatience also turns out to be crucial when cows communicate with each other. When a mother calls her calf, it sometimes takes 60 seconds for the calf to respond. The space between is filled with bodily gestures. Studies from Austria show that ear positioning and neck-stretching are integral to cow language. Humans think of the ability to wiggle our ears as a party trick. For a cow, it appears to be fundamental to communication. The first sentence in a conversation with a cow is likely to involve movement of the ears and a look.\u00a0\u00a0\nCows are not the only animals being studied for their complex modes of communication. Michelle Fournet, an assistant professor specialising in marine acoustic ecology at the University of New Hampshire in the US, has learned it is unhelpful to impose human expectations on species like whales and seals.\nAnimals use sound completely differently from how humans use it, she says. \"If we are to do a good job at understanding how animals are communicating and why they are communicating, it behoves us to adopt their perspective.\"\nFournet stops short of using the word \"language\" to describe the information transfer taking place between non-humans. But she has gained a deep appreciation for the subtleties of animal communication. Their system is not less than ours, Fournet says, but other. We do them a disservice by searching for similarities.\u00a0\nOne difference between humans and many animals is their use of the environment. Cornips has found cow communication leans on its surroundings more than ours. She observed one herd where individuals used their bodies to bang on an iron fence to communicate with the rest of the herd at feeding time, which she views as a type of language. She noticed cows responding to her differently depending on whether she entered a barn with solid walls or open sides: since cows on different farms are surrounded by different physical features, this offers distinctive opportunities for linguistic expression. Cows, she argues, develop diverse languaging practices \u2013 almost like dialects \u2013 where meaning depends on the shape of their surroundings.\nLike other domestic animals, cows face the additional challenge of interspecies communication with humans. \"Most farmers are not sensitive to the rhythm of the cow,\" says Cornips. \"The cows must obey the rhythm of the farmer.\" Dairy herds are constantly shunted between feeding, milking and grazing grounds. If a cow does not learn the daily routine or fails to be productive, it goes to the slaughterhouse. She is shocked by how readily people assume cows are stupid.\u00a0\n\"In becoming a dairy cow,\" she says, \"they must have very rich communicative skills because they have to understand what the farmer wants them to do\u2026 which is not easy.\"\nCornips has analysed recordings to show that cows will simplify their vocalisation once a farmer recognises their need. Rather than having their intelligence bred out of them to be more compliant, Cornips thinks domestic animals are forced to develop a fuller communication repertoire than wild animals.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf dairy cows have complex linguistic practices, it's tempting to ask how they stack up against the other great communicators in the animal kingdom. How would they compare, for example, to humpback whales? Cornips admires the complex vocalisations found in whale song. Humpbacks are among the cetaceans known to develop different dialects in different regions. They also communicate over vast distances. (Read more about the sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language which researchers are uncovering in whale communication).\nBut Cornips points out that whales lack some of the capacities of cows. A whale's ears are not as moveable as a cow's, she says. They also lack hooves. \"Whales cannot express themselves bodily very much,\" Cornips says. \"In that way they may be [less complex] than cows.\"\nFournet says she does not believe it makes sense to rank animal communication by its complexity. \"There isn't an answer to what you are looking for,\" she told me when I asked her to compare whales to cows.\nMany traditional linguists are still hesitant to ascribe language to non-humans. Leora Bar-el, a linguistics professor at the University of Montana in the US, is not hostile to the idea of animal language but thinks it worth asking what we gain and what we lose by expanding the definition of language to include cows.\n\"We may lose the fact there is something unique about human language,\" she says. For example, human language permits incredible creativity. Think of the works of Shakespeare. It can also refer to distant events and even reflect back on itself, as language does when it provides a definition.\nBut Eva Meijer, author of the essay that first inspired Cornips and the 2018 book Animal Languages, argues such claims can be self-fulfilling. \"What we see as language has been developed by excluding the language of other animals,\" she says. In fact, we define language in a way that makes it easy to deny it to others. Meijer points out the long history of human oppression associated with denying other people their language. She believes that recognising language in animals provides new tools for understanding them and perhaps even for learning how to inhabit the planet more sustainably.\nCornips, though, does not put an animal rights agenda at the centre of her work. She is focused primarily on expanding the field of linguistics. But the implications are hard to ignore. Cows may have more complex social lives than we thought. Her research reveals numerous additional avenues for exploration. How much does language contribute to distinctive bovine communities and cultures? What sort of planning can cows do with each other? Can they use language to pass on knowledge between generations?\nThe answers to these questions could change how we regard the lives of many animals. When 96% of the weight of mammals on earth is made up of humans and domesticated livestock, understanding better what cattle, sheep and chickens are communicating could lead to improved relationships with them, as well as better lives for animals.\u00a0\nCornips knows things are unlikely to change fast. Recently, though, she has noticed the idea that animals have language has become more common in academic journals.\nShe hopes linguistics can be a tool for unlocking different attitudes. \"My most important goal,\" she says, \"is to show others that you can look with different eyes at a domestic animal.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Swimming holidays are the ultimate in slow travel \u2013 and since the pandemic, they've become more popular than ever.\nThe pale-blue copper domes of the church of Our Lady of the Rock were easy to spot as we swam across the Bay of Kotor from the picturesque fishing village of Dra\u017ein Vrt. So too were shoals of Adriatic fish: sardines, mackerel and sprats, as well as sea anemones and urchins. The water was crystal clear and almost Caribbean blue; and when my head was not in the water, the landscape was panoramic mountains.\u00a0\nThis delightful experience was the first day of a swimming holiday in and around the Montenegro fjords. It was not a vacation that involved lying on a beach and taking the occasional dip in the sea, but one where we travelled by swimming in a group while a boat transported our gear from place to place. A swimming holiday is the ultimate in slow travel, moving through the water from island to island and cove to cove, stopping for lunch in a historic town or tiny fishing village before returning to the sea to meander further around the coastline.\u00a0\nFor a while, it seemed that no matter how far we swam, the church sitting in the middle of the bay on a rocky promontory was not getting any closer. The swim itself was rewarding, through clear, warm waters surrounded by jagged mountains, but the goal was the islet where, according to legend, local seamen found an icon of the Madonna and Child on a rock. They then swore that after each safe journey they would add another rock until the landmass gradually emerged from the sea, crowned by a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\nSuddenly it hove into near view and within minutes we were climbing out of the water, attracting strange glances from a wedding party gathered outside. The crew on our safety boat passed us towels and clothes, enabling us to cover up so we could enter and admire the ornately painted interior. Most people arrive by boat to this popular tourist destination, but swimming all the way there gave me some sense of the relief those fishermen must have felt when they returned home safely.\n\"Swimming gives you a unique eye-view on the world because you are seeing it from ground or sea level,\" says Ella Foote, editor of Outdoor Swimmer Magazine and author of the book How to Wild Swim. \"But it's also that so much of the world developed around a body of water. Most major towns and cities grew up around rivers or alongside the coast, especially when water was the main method of transportation. In the modern world we have lost what was an all-important connection with water and it's fascinating to rediscover it and approach a new place from the water that surrounds or runs through it.\"\u00a0\nOur group (we wonder, should the collective noun be \"a goggle\"?) was made up of 15 swimmers, drawn from around the globe and ranging in age from 20 to 60-something. In common was a love of swimming. though our abilities differed from reasonably competent pool swimmers to open water veterans and seasoned triathletes.\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWe were split into three groups of similar speeds (identifiable by different coloured swimming caps). Each group was shadowed by a small inflatable boat, while a bigger boat transported us and our gear to and from each swim, as well as providing a base for lunch, changing and anyone wanting a break. On average we swam around 5km a day; a challenging distance that requires stamina and strength, but knowing I could opt out and sit on the boat at any point somehow made that challenge easier.\nLeisure swimming has long been popular in the UK, from Britain's \"Lost King\", Prince Henry Frederick Stuart, the older brother of Charles I, who died after contracting typhoid swimming in the Thames, to the Victorians who made sea-bathing resorts fashionable. But perhaps the greatest swimming \"pioneer\" was the romantic poet Lord Byron.\nIn 1820, a 22-year-old Byron swam across the Hellespont, a tumultuous four-mile strait in Turkey now called the Dardanelles. The swim from Troy in Greece to Gallipoli connects Europe with Asia and was famous in Greek mythology for Leander's nightly swims to meet his lover.\n\"I'd read Byron's accounts of his travels and the Hellespont swim and decided that's what I wanted to do for my 30th birthday,\" said Simon Murie, the founder of the world's first ever swimming holiday business, SwimTrek.\n\"I found that the hardest part was not the swim itself but getting the necessary permissions, working out the route and finding a boat to accompany me. I realised I could not be the only swimmer wanting to swim from place to place but suspected many were put off by the organisation and so I decided to set up a business that would do all that, leaving swimmers to train and turn up.\"\nAnd so, 21 years ago, SwimTrek, based on the UK south coast in Brighton, was launched to mixed reactions.\n\"Our first-ever trip was swimming from island to island in the Greek Cyclades. I had done all the preparation and booked accommodation, but on our first night, the hotel owner had given all our rooms away. She could not grasp the concept that we would actually be swimming there!\"\nThe mistake was remedied, and since then SwimTrek has expanded its operations from taking 100 swimmers to four locations in that first year to more than 3,000 travellers to 40 destinations around the world in 2024. Other companies have subsequently entered the market. Some offer a similar range of trips and destinations, while others, like The Big Blue Swim, specialise in a handful of Greek Islands.\nMy trip to Montenegro was with Strel Swimming, which operates mainly in and around the Mediterranean. Established in 2010 by father and son Martin and Borut Strel, the company built on experience garnered surrounding Martin's epic marathon swims.\n\"Martin was the first person to ever swim the entire length of the Amazon River, and I worked with him as a guide and expedition leader on this and his Yangtze, Mississippi, Danube and Parana river swims,\" says Borut. \"With all our knowledge and expertise, it made sense to open our own business. We started in Croatia and Slovenia in 2010, adding new trips and locations year on year.\u00a0Swimming is a low-impact activity on the environment, and since we use local hotels, restaurants, boats and guides, our groups contribute to the local economy.\"\nOn the third day of our trip, we swam around Mamula Island, home to an impressive Austro-Hungarian fortress built to guard the entrance to Kotor Bay. In World War Two it was used as a concentration camp.\u00a0\n\"I'll probably always remember that island, along with the waves and currents that changed as we swam around it, and I doubt that'd be true if I'd only seen it from the boat,\" said Nancy Meade, an attorney form Anchorage, Alaska. This was the second time she had come to explore Europe from the water. \"The special thing about a swimming holiday is that it combines being active and outdoors all day long with a great chance to explore in a unique way. Most tourists can walk out to the seashore, and maybe even take a boat tour or cruise, but actually spending the day on and in the water and seeing the many small towns from the water is very special. Being at eye level with the shore and rocks makes you feel a part of the place much more than if you just spent a week on a boat looking around.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Cheese, beer and a wonderful view\n\u2022\u00a0Why wild swimming is Britain's new craze\n\u2022\u00a0The River Waveney: The 'secret' UK waterway most Brits don't know\nThe rise of the swimming holiday goes hand in hand with an increase in outdoor and open water swimming generally. In the UK, this took place after the 2012 London Olympics, which featured the first open water-swimming event. Globally, wild swimming saw another boost during the pandemic, when most indoor sport was banned.\nNaturally, as with any sporting holiday, there are risks \u00ad\u2013 and safeguards against them. Trained guides check locations before swims and routes are amended if the weather or water conditions are unsuitable. Safety briefings are given at the start of each swim, and guides help and encourage less confident swimmers to get the most out of their trip.\u00a0\n\"Each trip has something special about it,\" says Marlys Cappaert who has worked as a SwimTrek guide for 10 years. \"I really like those moments when someone overcomes a fear or tries a swim that they didn't think they could do. The joy when they succeed is giddy. And it can become quite emotional, too. In my first year, at the end of a week, one lady came to me sobbing. She shared with me that six months earlier she had received a challenging medical diagnosis and was unsure if she'd even be well enough to make our trip, let alone complete the swims. But she had. By that point, the whole group was sobbing.\"\nOn our final day, we made our way along the coast of the Lu\u0161tica peninsula and swam into a former submarine tunnel where the Yugoslavian Navy once hid their underwater vessels, ready to emerge in the event of attack. It was eerily cold and dark inside and we were glad to emerge into daylight and head further down to the coast to the crystal-clear waters of the Blue Cave. Inside the grotto, sunlight reflected off the white-sand seabed and rendered the waters a shimmering turquoise. A few motorboats with tourists taking photos hovered near the mouth of the cave as we swam deep inside relishing the unique experience our mode of travel afforded us.\u00a0\nAs the great swimmer Lord Byron wrote in his poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimate:\n'There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,\nThere is a rapture on the lonely shore,\nThere is society where none intrudes\nBy the deep Sea, and music in its roar'\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.\nIn 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn\u2019t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like Jos\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico \u2013 New Spain \u2013 were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.\u00a0 \n \n - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder\n \n -\u00a0The world\u2019s most mysterious silver cups\n-\u00a0How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence\nThe ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi \u2013 the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years \u2013 is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.\nArchaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account.\nArchaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The a\u00f1il plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn\u2019t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue\u2019s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the a\u00f1il plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered.\nRhapsody in blue\nMaster painters from the Americas are discussed in art history \u2013 if they\u2019re mentioned at all \u2013 as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Ju\u00e1rez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico\u2019s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Ju\u00e1rez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale \u2013 and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Ju\u00e1rez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens\u2019, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue \u2013 if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Ju\u00e1rez died in poverty.\u00a0 If Ju\u00e1rez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe?\nOn the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' \u2018fear of space\u2019 \u2013 the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident \u2013 thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result \u2013 the same as his peers in Mexico \u2013 was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.\nBaltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as \u2018El Echave de los azules\u2019 (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home.\nThe lack of written evidence of the use of a\u00f1il or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren\u2019t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from a\u00f1il by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries.\nThis cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.AlamyThe a\u00f1il plant, with which the Mayans mixed the clay they called attapulgite to create blue paint, not just the blue dye that came from the a\u00f1il plant (Credit: Alamy)Baltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as \u2018El Echave de los azules\u2019 (the Echave of the blues).

The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.Getty ImagesThe 1,600-year-old murals at the Mayan temple at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 still have vibrant colours, including blue, which usually fades (Credit: Getty Images)Archaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (created around 450 AD).",
