        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nIt had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".\nVance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".\nThe Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.\nBut Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.\nHe alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.\n\n\nMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".\nVance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.\nHe raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.\nThe safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.\nBut Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.\nVance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.\nIn response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".\nNine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIn the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties.\n\"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. \"There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, later shared parts of his speech on X, praising it as \"excellent\". The two reportedly met afterwards, according to German public broadcaster ZDF.\nIn his own speech, Pistorius directly addressed Vance, saying: \"Democracy was called into question by the US vice-president for the whole of Europe.\n\"He speaks of the annihilation of democracy,\" Pistorius continued. \"And if I have understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes... that is not acceptable.\"\nVance also made reference to the presidential election in Romania, which was annulled in December after declassified documents suggested it had been targeted by Russian state interference.\nVance told the conference: \"If your democracy can be destroyed with a few $100,000 of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with.\"\nRomanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said his country remains \"a defender of the democratic values that Europe shares with the USA\". \n\"All RO [Romanian] authorities are committed to organising free and fair elections by empowering citizens and guaranteeing the freedom to vote,\" he wrote on X.\nVance later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the conference, which has otherwise mainly focussed on Russia's full-scale invasion.\nZelensky said during the meeting that more work was needed on planning to end the fighting, while Vance said the pair shared a \"fruitful\" conversation.\nTrump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich, but Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the summit.",

        "article_text": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details\nAn Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.\nThe controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.\nEarlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.\nThe lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.\nBut on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.\nThe judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.\n\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\n\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \n\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"\nPriyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".\nShe added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \n\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"\nThe court documents make for grim reading.\nAccording to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".\nAfter he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.\nIn her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".\nA dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.\nWhile convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.\nJustice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.\nThe lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".\n\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"\nConsidering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.\nIndia is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.\nA number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.\nThe British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.\nBritain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book.\nThe idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.\nBut in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.\nThe Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. \nIn October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".\nAuthorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.\n\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.\n\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.\nViolence within marriage is rampant in India.\nAccording to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.\nAnd even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.\n\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.\nMs Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.\n\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"\nShe added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".\n\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\"",

He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.\nBut at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.\nAs a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.\nMoments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.\nSeveral of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)",

        "article_text": "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nKendrick Lamar's most famous lyric was the heard around the world at last weekend's Super Bowl.\nAn estimated 127 million viewers saw the rapper flash a devious smile to the camera as he delivered the line - a withering takedown of bitter rival Drake.\nTaken from Grammy-winning track Not Like Us, it refers to accusations that the Canadian star had relationships with underage women - something he's denied.\nBut as 70,000 fans inside New Orlean's Caesars Superdome belted it out with him, it felt like Kendrick's winning play in the pair's long-running beef. \nIt's been public, personal and petty, but Kendrick has implied that he's waging a much wider war. \nNot just against Drake, but against what he represents.\n\"Drake is the face of the hip-hop scene as it is,\" says Margs, a London rapper who hosts rap battles on his channel Pen Game. \nThe Canadian is a huge commercial success - the most streamed artist of the 2010s, 143 million Instagram followers and a fixture on party playlists and nightclub set lists.\nHis style is melodic and accessible. He sings. \nIn other words, he's as much a pop star as he is a rapper.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?\nItaly's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".\nOr as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".\nAdd cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.\n\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"\nMr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.\nYet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".\nIn 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.\nThis imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.\n\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.\nThese disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.\nTrump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.\nTrump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.\nIn fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.\nThe automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".\nAs such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.\nUS carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.\nMeanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.\nAfter years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.\nFord plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.\nElon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.\nEurope is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"\nHe also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.\n\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.\nHe adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.\nAdding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.\nMr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.\nMr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.\nNot least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".\n\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

        "article_text": "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.\nSir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".\nBut Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.\nHere we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.\nA detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \nIt accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.\nWe have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. \nThis was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.\nWhat we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion. \nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. \nShe said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.\nOther Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. \nOn Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". \nBoth he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. \nShe provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".\nHowever, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.\nKyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.\nHe also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. \nIn reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"\nShe said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.\nHer expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.\nReeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.\nThere is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\nReeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.\nWe established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nReeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.\nHowever, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. A year of that time was spent studying at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nThe BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.

        "summary": "What we've learned about Rachel Reeves's expenses - and the Labour response11 hours agoBilly KenberPolitics investigations correspondentSean SeddonBBC NewsReutersSince BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".But Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.What did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?The BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. \"She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. How are Labour defending Reeves?Reeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.What has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?Reeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.We established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.Reeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.However, her LinkedIn profile said she only worked there for six years - from September 2000 to December 2006. Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockScience Secretary Peter Kyle has criticised the BBC's reporting on Rachel ReevesWhat did the HR manager say?Wayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team.",

He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn \u00a320.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. The release clause can be triggered for \u00a3145m before the final year of his contract and then goes down to \u00a383m.\nJust last week, it was revealed Kane also possesses certain release clauses that can be triggered before the respective ends of the January transfer windows to initiate a move for the summer.\nAs valuable as the England captain has been in his role as Bayern's top-notch goalscorer, the 31-year-old is obviously not seen as a long-term solution for Bayern, with an eventual return to the Premier League - where Kane could eventually break Alan Shearer's goalscoring record - appearing likely.\nMeanwhile, Musiala is 10 years younger than Kane and the perfect representative for Bayern, who have always been anxious to assemble the best German players, mixed with a number of high-profile talents from abroad.\nMusiala has already created countless moments of magic for Bayern, including his championship-clinching goal against Cologne in May 2023, when the team snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund during the final minutes of the season.\nMusiala played for England's youth teams but opted to represent Germany, the country of his birth\nWhen Musiala misses games or can only play a limited number of minutes due to an injury, his absence has been felt as the team does not look the same at all.\nBayern's 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Uefa Champions League earlier this season was a prime example.\nMusiala himself has talked about how he can be almost obsessed with improving his game through repetition and specialised training, for example practising certain shooting positions and movements.\n\"I just try to do everything that can take me to the next level,\" he said in 2023. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.\n\"I try to start at a young age with nutrition, the extra work so I can have more stamina, and then season by season, hopefully I get better.\"\nThere can be no doubt he has improved, instead of just resting on his natural talent as a footballer, and can do even further to put his name high among the world's best players in the future.\nIt is the reason why Musiala has just signed the most lucrative contract extension in German Bundesliga history.\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'",

The 51-year-old said she works seven days a week, clocking up more than 80 hours, just to make ends meet. \n\"It's really bad financially, emotionally physically, everything,\" Ms Dumitrescu said.\n\"I can't afford to make bills, rent, food, which is so expensive now. It's really, really bad.\"\nMs Dumitrescu said she hopes the strike leads to higher pay agreements.\n\"The customers, they are with us,\" she added. \"Every driver is upset because they don't earn enough. They ask you how much you get from this trip and are surprised at how little we get.\"\nAn Uber spokesperson said all its drivers are guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage, and that the majority can and do earn more.\n\"On average, drivers across the UK earn more than \u00a330 per hour when taking trips on Uber,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"They also have access to industry-leading protections such as holiday pay, a pension and free sickness and injury cover, as well as formal representation through GMB Union.\"\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company was \"committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers\".\n\"All drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension,\" the spokesperson added.\nJust over an hour into the strike, a Bolt spokesperson said service levels were \"unaffected\" and users were \"able to book rides as normal\".\nAddison Lee has been contacted for comment. The company previously told the PA news agency: \"We have a close working relationship with our drivers, which was further reinforced in our recent bi-annual driver satisfaction survey. We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"\nIn September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.\nIn January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.\nHelio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.\nHe has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving. \nMr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".\n\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"\nMr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".\n\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.\nThe IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.\nAlongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.\nA spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.\nPart of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.\nMr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.\nThe IWGB said the vigil marks four years since his death, and that drivers are demanding better protections in his name.",

        "article_text": "In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home.\nIn the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire.  Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.\nBut now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.\nEgyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.\n\"We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!\" says Abdo, a civil engineer.  \"The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them.  This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence.\"\nOthers stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt.\nTo try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz.  He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally.\nEgypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East.\nSince Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally.  Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty.  Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance.\nHowever, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism.  American military aid \"does not constitute any value to Egypt,\" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said.  He insisted Egyptians refuse \"pressure\" or \"blackmail\".\nEgypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans.\nEgyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled.\nEgypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.\nThe hope now is that by devising its own \"masterplan\" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy.\nThe Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (\u00a316bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.\nThe plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: \"I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt.\"\nVarious \"innovative ideas\" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction.\nSpeaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states \"don't like\" the Trump Gaza plan. \"Now, if someone has a better plan \u2013 and we hope they do,\" he went on, \"now's the time to present it.\"\nSome Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative \"comprehensive vision\" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February.\nProposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role.\nEgypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects.\nHowever, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging.\nThe former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge.  But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood.\nEgypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to \"achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause.\"\nBack outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history.\nAlready Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil.\nUltimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US.\n\"Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!\" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name.\n\"The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours.

Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza.But now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to \"a parcel of land\" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat.Egyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check.

It is a delicate matter and, of course, do we think it's right? Of course not.\"\nSpeaking at the launch of the new Williams F1 car, Sainz said he felt drivers should be able to control themselves sufficiently not to swear in news conferences and other public forums, but that in the car it was a different matter.\nSainz said: \"What we say on the [car] radio, I don't agree with what is happening. I think you can not be too tough on these kinds of things because you cannot understand the pressure and adrenaline and the way we feel in the car when we open the radio.\n\"And I feel for F1 it is good to have those moments because you see the real driver.\n\"We are already very constrained as F1 drivers to what we can tell you about our teams, about out situations. We already have a lot of media briefings. They already tell us what to say on the radio.\n\"But when you hear that passion, those words, even if sometimes we swear on the radio, for me that's a keeper in F1 and it is something we shouldn't get rid of.\"\nThe FIA has not explained how the new system will be applied, but last year president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said he wanted to stop drivers swearing while driving.\nSainz said the drivers have not had any clarification from the FIA.\nHe and Albon both drove Williams' new 2025 car as it was unveiled at Silverstone on Friday.\nVerstappen restricts answers after 'ridiculous' swearing punishment\nFerrari's Leclerc fined for swearing in news conference\nF1 drivers ask FIA to treat them like adults\nSainz explained that his first impressions were \"positive\", and he said Williams' willingness to host a day for media and sponsors and give the car its debut at the same time was indicative of the progress the team had made.\nLast year, the team struggled at the start of the season as attempts to introduce new processes in the team delayed the car build. A crash-strewn 2024 season has also impacted the team financially.\nSainz, whose seat at Ferrari was taken by Lewis Hamilton, said he wanted Williams to continue to show progress in 2025 as they build towards the new regulations that will be introduced in F1 in 2026.\n\"It is important to keep the momentum up, keep the positive trend, the forward trajectory,\" Sainz said.\n\"And if we manage to keep that momentum going and riding the wave in a way, that for me is the most important because Williams' big opportunity comes more in '26 than '25.\"\nSainz shrugged off a question as to how he would feel when he sees Hamilton in a Ferrari for the first time by saying he had \"been through that already\" after seeing the seven-time champion's appearance at the Ferrari factory last month.\nSpaniard Sainz won four grands prix for Ferrari in his four years with the team and said he was not sure how he would feel about his inevitable fall down the field.\n\"I don't know how much I am going to miss it, how much fun I am going to find it fighting for P7-P15,\" Sainz said. \"Maybe you need to ask me later in the year how I am finding it.\n\"But what I can tell you is I'm very happy and motivated, I am excited, I feel supported. I feel a team full of good, positive energy and a team principal and team that fully trusts in my abilities and wants to listen to what I have to say and I have confidence in my ability to move forward.\"\nTeam boss James Vowles said the car was an \"evolution\" of last year's model but that the team's prime focus this year was to ensure it was best prepared for 2026, when new engine and chassis rules come on stream together for the first time in F1's modern era.\n\"Everyone is aligned, and that includes Carlos and Alex, that we want to be winning championships and for that we can't keep giving a little bit towards now because it looks better,\" Vowles said.\n\"If you put your focus on the following year you miss out on that long-term evolution. There are bits we're doing today that won't come on line until 2027.\n\"The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it, but I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nWhen are the F1 cars revealed for the 2025 season?\nNorris needs to be 'smart' to beat Verstappen",

        "article_text": "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.\nTrump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.\nThe UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.\nAnalysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.\nThe latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\". \nOne of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.\nThe use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.\nBoth the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.\nThe president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\". \nVAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.\nGeorge Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries. \nBut he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".\nFiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.\nBut she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".\nShe said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.\nPaul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.\nBut he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".\nMr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.\nA tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.\nBut in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.\nCaroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.\nShe suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair. \n\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.\nMr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".\nSenior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.\n\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\"",

This year, he paid almost four times that.\n\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.\n\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"\nGoing to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.\nBefore the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.\nThat number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.\nThe last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.\nFor this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.\nIn this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.\nFor some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.\nThat means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged. \nOne person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.\nShe said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.\nFekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.\n\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"\nAfter putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.\nShe noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.\n\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says. \n\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.\nFekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.\nBut why are concerts suddenly so pricey?\nTicketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years. \nAs Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.\nThe star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.\nBut that's not all.\n\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.\n\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"\nHowever, he notes that artists like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay have made deliberate efforts to keep their shows affordable. \nTickets to see Coldplay at Wembley Stadium this summer start at just \u00a320, with 10% of the total proceeds going to the Music Venues Trust to help young bands at the start of their careers. \nBut most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".\n\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"\nIncreased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry. \n\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.\n\"There is an increasing level of evidence to show that the mid-market and the grassroots market are being squeezed by the success of the top tier.\"\nMichael Rapino, CEO of concert promoters Live Nation, says high prices are here to stay - but argues that musicians will never match what sports teams charge.\n\"In sports... somehow it's a badge of honour that if you spend $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for a Lakers ticket, it's OK,\" he told Bloomberg last year.\n\"But Sally from the Valley believes that she should see Olivia [Rodrigo] at $79 (\u00a363) because, you know, she broke up with her boyfriend to that music.\n\"So where do [artists] find that line where it's accessible, the fan feels connected to them [but] they don't feel like they're over-gouging?\"\nNo-one knows, he said, but \"it's slowly moving up over time\".",

        "article_text": "The spotlight is on Philippe Clement (left) and Jimmy Thelin (right) while Daizen Maeda could be Celtic's key man in Munich\nThe Premiership returns this weekend after a Scottish Cup weekend that did not lack for storylines.\nThe Ibrox inner sanctum has said nothing about Philippe Clement's position since their cup exit and in that vacuum gossip and fan fury have thrived. \nRangers' trip to Tynecastle on Sunday is therefore eagerly awaited - and so too is Aberdeen's game against Dundee, with Jimmy Thelin also remarkably feeling the heat.\nThere are calmer waters at Celtic, but the biggest game of their season looms large.\nHere are a few things to look out for this weekend...\nClement will perhaps be surprised he is still in charge at Ibrox after the embarrassing Scottish Cup exit against Queen's Park.\nWith Rangers failing to mount a title challenge, the defeat against the Spiders has turned up the heat significantly on the Belgian.\nRangers' hierarchy have been tight-lipped all week, which is a backing of sorts. But Clement will surely know a poor result at Tynecastle will nudge him closer to an exit.\nSix weeks ago he might have fancied his side's chances of earning a morale-boosting victory, but Neil Critchley has steadily improved Heart of Midlothian since taking time to assess the squad.\nThey have won four of their five league games in 2025 - with one draw - which is as many victories as in their final 22 matches of 2024.\nCammy Devlin has been pivotal to their resurgence. He tops the table for the number of tackles (23) as well as being joint-top for interceptions in the Premiership in 2025. \nTo get at Hearts' defence, first you have to find a way past the Australia defensive midfielder. His availability after a concussion at St Mirren on Monday could well be key to this game.\nThe loan signing of Belgian striker Elton Kabangu seems to have liberated Lawrence Shankland too, and the Jambos showed the sort of resilience that was sorely lacking earlier in the season when they edged past the Buddies in the Scottish Cup.\nYet, despite the cloud hanging over Clement, Rangers have won each of their past four league games - and all by a margin of at least two goals. It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.\nHistory is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.\nRangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.\nThat record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.\nThis video can not be played\nMOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'\nThird-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.\nThat said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.\nSo, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.\nCould that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?\nHe has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.\nPerhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.\nMight Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?\nIf he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?\nThis video can not be played\nHighlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline Athletic\nEvery new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.\nIt usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.\nThen Thelin pitched up. \nThe Dons had chased the Swede for a long time before landing him and it soon became clear why they had been so patient. Ten wins from their first 11 Premiership games at the start of the season and a dramatic point at Celtic led to talk of a title challenge.\nThelin had somehow turned largely the same squad that saw off Neil Warnock within eight games into one that seemed poised to push Celtic into the new year.  \nHis stock went through the roof and there was even gossip linking him with ambitious Birmingham City.\nBut if his stock rose rapidly, it has dropped even more quickly. Aberdeen have lost eight and drawn one of their past nine league games - as many defeats as in their previous 37 games.\nThey have gone from putting pressure on Celtic in second to fourth - just five points ahead of eighth.

        "summary": "It is Rangers' longest run of league wins by more than one goal since April 2023.History is in Clement's favour too, with Hearts winless in their past 17 meetings with Rangers in all competitions, a run that includes 13 defeats.Rangers' only defeat in their past 26 league games against Hearts was a 2-1 reverse in January 2020 under Steven Gerrard.That record means Rangers and their fans have become used to success against Hearts - and therefore anything other than another victory in Gorgie could spell the end for Clement.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, MOTD analysis: Maeda performance gives Celtic 'hope'Player to watch - Daizen Maeda (Celtic)Third-placed Dundee United are the visitors to Celtic Park this weekend, so it is a long way from the Premiership leaders' most straightforward game of the season.That said, the Tangerines have won just once in five league games, and Celtic's lead at the top is 13 points.So, while Brendan Rodgers will be focused on a win against Jim Goodwin's side, he will surely have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, when they need to turn around a 2-1 deficit.Could that therefore mean a start on Saturday for Jota, to get the Portuguese winger valuable minutes as he seeks sharpness?He has understandably looked short of top form since he returned to Glasgow after relatively little football in the past 18 months, but Celtic looked a more effective team when he came on against Bayern in the first leg.Perhaps just as important, his introduction meant Daizen Maeda moved more central, and his harassing of Bayern's defenders meant they hit more long balls under pressure.Might Rodgers be tempted to play Jota from the start against United to help his fitness before Tuesday's big game?If he does that, would a game alongside Maeda as the central striker help their understanding or might Adam Idah continue as the number nine to give the workaholic Japan forward a rest before the do-or-die match in Germany?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Highlights: Aberdeen 3-0 Dunfermline AthleticManager in the spotlight - Jimmy Thelin (Aberdeen)Every new Aberdeen manager walks in the daunting shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson when they arrive at Pittodrie.It usually takes no more than a game or two for fans and the outside world to conclude that the new man is not going to be the second coming of 'Fergie'.Then Thelin pitched up. Thelin, incredibly, is under serious pressure for his job within two months of being touted as Fergie 2.0.His tactics and style of play have been criticised, with suggestions other teams have now worked him out.The good news for him is the Dons play Dundee next.Aberdeen's last league win was against Dundee, three months ago, and the last time they won an away league game was against Dundee, almost five months ago.Tony Docherty's side have conceded more goals (53) and faced a higher expected goals against total (46.1) than any other side in the Premiership this season. Oh, and Dundee have been thrashed 6-0 in their last two games - the first side to suffer two six-goal margins of defeat in a season since Motherwell in 2015-16.Aberdeen stopped the rot with a cup win last weekend but, a bit like Clement, Thelin is expected to win this game. They have won just two of their past 30 league meetings with Aberdeen and Saturday's visitors have won both of their league meetings with Dundee this season. Rangers' trip to Tynecastle on Sunday is therefore eagerly awaited - and so too is Aberdeen's game against Dundee, with Jimmy Thelin also remarkably feeling the heat.There are calmer waters at Celtic, but the biggest game of their season looms large.Here are a few things to look out for this weekend...Game of the weekend - Hearts v RangersClement will perhaps be surprised he is still in charge at Ibrox after the embarrassing Scottish Cup exit against Queen's Park.With Rangers failing to mount a title challenge, the defeat against the Spiders has turned up the heat significantly on the Belgian.Rangers' hierarchy have been tight-lipped all week, which is a backing of sorts.",

        "article_text": "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.\nTweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.\nThe Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.\nIn a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"\nSpeaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that. \n\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made. \n\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"\nThe original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.\nAfter they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context. \nAsked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.\n\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"\nShe highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence? \n\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"\nBajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.\n\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"\nGasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.\nIn an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".\nShe added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".\nHer statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.\nNetflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.\nAt this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.\nThe movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.\nBut the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.\nPreviously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.\nBut an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.\n\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.\nGasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.\nBut she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\nIt has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".\nThe fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.\nOften, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.\nGasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.\nThese included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nHowever, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.\nAnd that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.\nThe publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".\nIt remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.\nMany film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies. \nThis sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.\nFor example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.\nTraditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.\nHowever, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.\nDespite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy. \nInstead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.\nIt has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.\nIt was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.\n\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"\nLater, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".\nOscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.\nMeanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".\n\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.\n\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. \n\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"\nAfter his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"\nShe also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".\n",

        "article_text": "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.\nCheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.\nNow, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.\n\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.\n\"That's what we want.\"\nMr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.\nProductions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.\nThe loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.\nBefore the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.\n\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"\nHollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.\nMany say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA. \nBut studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.\nStudios are, however, very responsive to A-list actors.\nMegastar Vin Diesel helped ensure Universal Pictures would finish filming the latest Fast and Furious movie in Los Angeles.\n\"LA really, really, really needs production to help rebuild,\" Diesel said in an Instagram post.\n\"Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago\u2026 and now Fast will finally return home.\"\nNearly 20,000 people \u2013 including actors Keanu Reeves, Zooey Deschanel and Kevin Bacon \u2013 have signed a \"Stay in LA\" petition urging the state's leaders to temporarily remove caps on production tax incentives for LA County.\nIt's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.\n\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.\nBefore the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.\nHe says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.\nIf passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.\nPresident Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".\nIt's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.\nOn a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.\n\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.\nAlthough he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.\nMs Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.\n\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"\nOthers think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.\nPointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.\nHis once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.\n\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.\nAbout a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.\nShe laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.\n\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.\nMs Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.\n\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"\nDoes she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?\n\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\"",

        "article_text": "A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country.\nThe properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board.\nThe new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion.\nOn 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders.\nThey claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation.\nThe new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.\nBut several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.\nA vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.\nThe tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.\nThe properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.\nThe government says that the waqf boards are among India\u2019s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).\nMuslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. \nBut critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies \u2013 which too requires immediate attention.\nA report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. \nThe committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.\nThe committee also noted that \u201cencroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common\u201d, listing hundreds of instances of such \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d of waqf land by government authorities.\nAccording to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.\nThe amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.\nParliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.\nBut many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.\nMany of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.\nThe 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.\nProfessor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.\n\u201cYou can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,\u201d Prof Rehman says.\nOthers worry that the new bill may not address the community\u2019s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.\nThat's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. \nSome agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. \nBut the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. \u201cThere seems to be an attempt not only to get the state\u2019s control over Muslims\u2019 properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community\u2019s lives.\u201d\nAmong other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf\u2019s claim to a property is valid.\nCritics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.\nThe current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.\nBut some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. \n\"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,\u201d Owaisi recently told reporters.\nThis process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.\n\u201cThe diagnosis may be correct,\u201d Prof Rehman says, \u201cbut the treatment is not.\u201d",

        "article_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas. \nModi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\nWhile both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\". \nThe Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US. \nAt a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.\n\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".\nTrump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries. \n\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.\nWith India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC. \n\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said. \nHowever, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said. \n\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit. \nTrump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets. \nThe two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".\nModi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US. \nLast week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday. \n Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\nShortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.\nHe acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".\nTrump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.\n\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"\nThe White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.\nThe document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.\n\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said. \n\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"\nTrump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic. \nHe has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. \nEarlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs.",

        "article_text": "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the chancellor's online CV, and the use of expenses while working at a bank, in the wake of a BBC News investigation.\nRachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.\nIt was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.\nSir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter. \nThe initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.\nWe have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.\nA spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.\n\nBBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP\nIn a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.\nThe prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".\nHe said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.\nShe posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"\nRachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.\nThe chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.\nOn the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.\nHowever, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.\nA spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.\nThey said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.\nSpeaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.\nAsked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"\nThe Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.\nReeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006\nThe rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.\nA photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.\nA former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.\nIn a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"\nIn a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\" \nShe said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.\nThe claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".\nAs she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nLast year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.\nReeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.\nShe stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London.

        "article_text": "From raw eggs to protein shakes, those hoping to expand their brawn are often encouraged to ingest vast quantities of protein. But how much is really necessary and what's the best way to consume it?\nSophia\u00a0Moulson, 21, a fitness influencer based in West Sussex, began taking fitness seriously at the age of 19, after struggling with being overweight.\n\"I often turned to food as a source of comfort, which ultimately left me in a cycle of negative self-image and low confidence. One day, I realised that I needed to take control \u2013 not just for my physical health but for my mental wellbeing too,\" says Moulson.\nInitially, she joined the gym with the sole intention of losing weight. But over time, she fell in love with the process of building up a healthy amount of muscle too. \"I discovered how empowering it felt to grow stronger, and each small strength milestone motivated me to keep pushing forward,\" she says.\nAn integral part of Moulson's progress was research on nutrition. That's when she learned about the importance of protein for building muscle. However, as a vegetarian, Moulson initially felt that she was struggling to get enough protein through just her diet, so she turned to protein powders. \"While it was possible for me to meet my needs through a well-balanced diet, it often required time and careful planning. Protein powders offered a convenient solution, especially with my busy lifestyle,\" she says.\nWhile in the past, bodybuilders were notorious for consuming vast quantities of steak and drinking raw eggs, today, protein powders and tailored diets are big business. But do we really need so much protein to grow stronger? And what is the best way to consume it?\nLinea Patel, a\u00a0Sports Dietitian at the company Pure Sports Medicine in London, explains that proteins have many roles in the human body. As they are digested, the proteins in food are broken down into amino acids \u2013 building blocks that can be rearranged to form any protein that the body needs. Haemoglobin, enzymes, muscles, the keratin in our skin and hair \u2013 there are more than 20,000 proteins in the human body, performing a wide range of functions.\nHowever, the amount that each person needs can vary greatly, depending on their age, body composition and lifestyle.\n\"In the UK, the government guidelines say that the general baseline for sedentary adults is that they should consume 0.8 or 0.75g\u00a0[around 0.03oz] of protein per kg of their own body weight,\" says Patel. \"So, for example, if somebody weighed 70kg [154lb], then you just multiply that by 0.8 and you'll get 56g [around 2oz] of protein a day.\"\nMost people get more than that amount from their normal diets. In the US, the average American consumes around 14-16% of their total calories as protein. However, if you're more active, your protein requirements may exceed 1g per kg each day. The amount of protein you need also depends on factors such as your age, because people tend to lose muscle mass as they get older \u2013 consuming more protein can help us to hold onto more muscle. Post-menopausal women also have higher protein requirements.\n\"What I see in my clinical practice, particularly because I work with women in the menopause or high performing individuals [sportspeople], is that perhaps that they're not eating enough protein for their level of activity or to maintain [appropriate] muscle mass for their stage of life,\" says Patel. One size doesn't fit all, she explains.\nFor individuals engaging in regular high-intensity resistance training or athletes and powerlifters or body builders, research has found that the daily\u00a0protein\u00a0requirement is approximately 1.6-2.2g (0.06-0.08oz) per kg of body weight to maximise muscle\u00a0protein\u00a0synthesis.\u00a0\nMany medical professionals recommend that people acquire the protein they need from their diets, wherever possible. For vegans, this can involve consuming more nuts, seeds and soya-based products, as well as pulses such as beans and lentils. For vegetarians, eggs, yoghurt and certain types of cheese can be added, while omnivores may also want to increase their consumption of meat and seafood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor many, consuming enough protein involves experimenting with different foods. However, not everyone has the time or money to acquire adequate protein through their diet alone.\u00a0\n\"Even though, theoretically, one can meet this target through a balanced diet rich in\u00a0protein-dense foods like lean meats, eggs, dairy and legumes, for many this may not be easy without supplementation,\" says Cyriac Abby Philips, a liver specialist at the Rajagiri Hospital in Kerala, India.\nLauren Manaker a dietician based in Charleston, South Carolina in the US, adds that protein powders \"do provide a convenient and portable option, especially for individuals with busy lifestyles or limited access to whole food sources\".\nGlobally, the protein powder market has been valued at $4.4bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2021, and is expected to grow to $19.3bn (\u00a315.6bn) by 2030. There are many formulations \u2013 both animal and plant-based, in the form of shakes, or added to nutrition bars, yoghurts and ready meals.\n\"When I incorporated plant-based protein powders into my diet, it became much easier to hit my protein goals\u2026 Over time, I experimented with different options and found that lean protein powders or whey protein worked best for me, as they are low in calories but high in protein,\" says Moulson.\nHowever, protein powders can come with risks, and there's some evidence in rats that they could lead to liver damage in those who are not exercising. There have also been rare cases of toxicity to the liver from whey and soy-based protein powders in humans.\u00a0\nProtein powders can also be misleadingly labelled and may contain harmful contaminants. For a recent study, Philips and colleagues from India and the US analysed protein powders sold in India. The team found that many powders contained more or less protein than they were marketed as having \u2013 leading to concerns about \"protein-spiking\" \u2013 as well as contaminants including heavy metals, fungal toxins and herbal extracts that may be toxic to the liver.\nToxins in protein powders may be more widespread than we think.\nIn 2018, a nonprofit group called the Clean Label Project, based in Broomfield, Colorado, released a report about toxins in popular brands of protein powders in the US. Researchers screened 134 products for 130 types of toxins and found that many protein powders contained heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury), bisphenol-A (or BPA, which is used to manufacture plastic), pesticides, or other contaminants with links to cancer and other health conditions. Some toxins were present in significant quantities.\nFor example, one protein powder contained 25 times the allowed limit of BPA in the US. The pesticides and chemicals came from agricultural residue and from the packaging of these powders, researchers observed. Interestingly, one certified \"organic\" product had twice the contaminants of non-certified ones. Plant-based protein powders were the most contaminated, while egg and whey-based powders were found to be the cleanest.\nBecause protein powders are considered dietary supplements and not pharmaceuticals, regulation from governing authorities tends to be more relaxed \u2013 in the US and the UK, they're considered food. This has led to concerns that they are not being regulated strictly enough.\nWhen increasing body muscle, it's not impossible to get your protein requirements through the foods you eat, but it can take considerable time and planning. The key to achieving your daily requirements is to eat protein at every meal and to plan your meals around a principal source of protein, says Patel.\n\"We're looking to aim for at least 20-30g (0.7-1.1oz) of protein per meal,\" says Patel. That would be the equivalent to a couple of eggs or some Greek yogurt with nuts sprinkled on top, or a chicken breast, or a piece of tofu that is the size of your fist.\n\"So, for example, you might have to have two eggs on sourdough toast with some avocado with some seeds sprinkled on top \u2013 with the eggs being the principal protein, the food source with the highest protein content,\" says Patel. \"In a meal that consists of beans or lentils with some rice, the lentils would be the principal protein.\"\nIf you decide to take a protein supplement instead or as well as altering your diet, there are a few simple rules for choosing one that is least likely to contain harmful substances. First of all, prioritise high-quality\u00a0proteins with minimal additives, says Philips.\n\"One must definitely avoid 'blended'\u00a0proteins\u00a0with herbal components as the risk of adulteration, contamination inclusive of the presence of heavy metals and fungal toxins are higher in these types of\u00a0protein\u00a0supplements,\" he says.\nManaker also advises that consumers do their research, particularly to avoid unnecessary ingredients. \"Look for protein powders that contain high-quality ingredients and have minimal additives, fillers or artificial sweeteners. Opt for brands that prioritise transparency and provide detailed information about the sourcing and processing of their ingredients,\" Manaker says.\nManaker also recommends considering the source of the protein in the powder. It's important to check labels to see if it's from whey, casein, soya, plant or animal-based proteins, she says. \"Choose a protein source that aligns with your dietary preferences, allergies or sensitivities.\"\nIf you're taking a protein supplement or powder, timing can play a role in optimising its benefits, says Manaker. \"Consuming protein within 30 minutes to an hour after a workout is often recommended to take advantage of the body's heightened ability to absorb and utilise nutrients during this time,\" she says.\nAnd the way you take protein powders matters. While protein supplements can be beneficial, it's crucial to avoid relying solely on them as a source of nutrition. \"Whole, nutrient-dense foods should form the foundation of your diet, and supplements should only complement a well-balanced eating plan. Avoid the temptation to replace meals entirely with protein powders, as this can lead to an inadequate intake of other essential nutrients,\" says Manaker.\nWith widespread access to protein powders and protein-rich foods today, some people do consume more protein than what they probably need, says Manaker. For example, while the average adult needs around 45-56 grams (1.6-2 ounces) of protein per day, in the UK people tend to consume around 75-100 grams (2.6-3.5 ounces). \u00a0While it is essential for muscle building and overall health, consuming an excessive amount of protein intake can have potential risks.\n\"High protein intake over a prolonged period can put strain on the kidneys,\" says Manaker. \"Individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions should be particularly cautious.\"\nFurthermore, a sudden increase in protein intake, especially from protein powders, can sometimes lead to digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas and constipation. \"Keep an eye on the way your body reacts, even as you tweak your protein [intake],\" says Patel.\nKeep in mind that it's easy to go overboard with protein powders. \"As a general guideline, I wouldn't recommend that people using protein powders exceed 80g [2.8oz] a day,\" says Patel. \"Even 80g of protein from protein powder is excessive for most people. It's going to completely displace whole foods that provide vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that we need. So in general, for most of my clients I tell them to stick with 20 to 40g [0.7-1.4oz] of protein powder per day.\"\nIn particular, problems tend to arise when one's diet is laser-focused only on proteins, says Patel. Micronutrients from fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates, which are also vital for a balanced diet, can end up being neglected.\nIn order to optimise your diet while weight training, ensure that you're including quality carbohydrates and prioritise micro-nutrients like Vitamin D, magnesium, iron and Omega 3 fats. \"They're all essential for optimum muscle contraction, bone health and energy. Eat fruits, vegetables and include oily fish in your diet at least once a week,\" says Patel.\nGetting enough protein is key to growing stronger muscles, but it's only one of the pillars of wellness, says Patel. \"The other pillars are physical activity, getting the training right and sleeping well,\" she says.\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "Avoid the temptation to replace meals entirely with protein powders, as this can lead to an inadequate intake of other essential nutrients,\" says Manaker.Beware of too much proteinWith widespread access to protein powders and protein-rich foods today, some people do consume more protein than what they probably need, says Manaker. \"When I incorporated plant-based protein powders into my diet, it became much easier to hit my protein goals\u2026 Over time, I experimented with different options and found that lean protein powders or whey protein worked best for me, as they are low in calories but high in protein,\" says Moulson.However, protein powders can come with risks, and there's some evidence in rats that they could lead to liver damage in those who are not exercising. One size doesn't fit all, she explains.Getty ImagesBefore protein shakes and powders, many people boosted their protein intake by consuming raw eggs (Credit: Getty Images)Different requirementsFor individuals engaging in regular high-intensity resistance training or athletes and powerlifters or body builders, research has found that the daily\u00a0protein\u00a0requirement is approximately 1.6-2.2g (0.06-0.08oz) per kg of body weight to maximise muscle\u00a0protein\u00a0synthesis.

A bit of a throwback. The place was boiling hot all night. It was an incredible atmosphere.\"\nAnd in those few words, Moyes summed up the special magic of Goodison Park.\nIt may be creaking in parts, but on fiery nights like this with Liverpool as the opposition, it literally rocks - parts of it really do - with a glorious support and naked hostility like few other places in world football.\nEverton may have that state-of-the-art new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock ready to go next season, but it is an almost impossible task to replicate what they have in this place - ramshackle and old-fashioned in parts admittedly, hence the need to move.\nGoodison Park was never going to go quietly, but this was something else - full of emotion, passion and all the wild scenes of indiscipline Moyes called \"to-ing and fro-ing\" after the final whistle.\nIt may have pillars blocking some of the views, but it still has so much that will be missed with its towering Main Stand and the criss-cross designs on the stands that are the trademark of famous Scottish architect Archibald Leitch.

        "article_text": "Suggesting that natural products or ingredients are inherently superior to those that are synthetic is a common flaw in reasoning used by influencers, brands and politicians alike.\nBefore writing this column, I had a hair appointment. As my stylist fastened the smock cape around my neck, she gestured to the shampoo she'd use. \"It's a new line, made from 90% natural ingredients,\" she explained. The accompanying pamphlet, contained short descriptions of each product \u2013 one shampoo used prickly pear extract, another acai berries. A third incorporated chia seeds.\nWhen I got home \u2013 purchased shampoo bottles in hand \u2013 I took a closer look at the ingredient list. Cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, behentrimonium chloride, isopropyl myristate. All common, laboratory-made ingredients. None worried me. But none of which, despite being used in far greater quantities than any of the fruit extracts, were highlighted in the brand's adverts.\nThe tactic that had been used \u2013 perhaps successfully, in my case \u2013 is hundreds of years old. It is often deployed on social media, by brands and influencers, and by politicians around the globe.\nOften called an \"appeal to nature\", or the \"naturalistic fallacy\", it is one of the most commonly-seen types of logical fallacies, or flaws in reasoning that can make a claim sound surprisingly convincing. Anytime you hear someone make a claim that a product or practice is superior because it is \"natural\", or that one is inferior (or even harmful) because it is not \"natural\", this is the naturalistic fallacy at work. So are arguments that something is \"as nature intended\", or that something is bad specifically because it is a \"chemical\" or \"synthetic\".\nNature is, in many ways, wonderful. And it has a great deal to teach us. So why isn't it true that something is better merely because it comes from nature?\nFor one thing, because nature, of course, does not have intentions \u2013 not in any conscious sense. As such, nor does it have intentions to be good, or to help humans, specifically.\nWe don't need to get too philosophical to grasp this. Just consider a handful of nature's creations. Arsenic, which can kill an adult with a dose as little as 70mg, is natural. So is asbestos, which causes cancer. Cyanide, which can kill with as little as 1.5mg per kilogram of body weight if ingested, is a phytotoxin produced, naturally, by more than 2,000 different plant species, including almonds, apricots and peaches. This is also why some \"natural\" remedies frequently marketed \u2013 such as ground apricot seeds \u2013 can in fact be dangerous to consume.\nAnd this is the trouble with the use of the word natural that is so commonly used to market products. It is a poorly defined term that doesn't necessarily mean the product labelled as such will be better for you, or indeed safer, than any other alternatives.\nOne investigation of teething products for babies labelled as \"natural\" found, for example, that more than 370 infants experienced adverse events such as seizures or delirium. The products were found to contain inconsistent, and at times elevated, levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade.\nOf course, there are other natural phenomena we could look at beyond ingredients used in products. Smallpox, for example, once killed one out of every three people it infected. This naturally occurring virus was responsible for killing a jaw-dropping 300-500 million people in the 20th Century alone before it was eradicated thanks to vaccination. Poison ivy and polio, tornadoes and tick bites, the inevitable and eventual death of the Sun that will end all of life on Earth? Natural, natural, natural.\nHow not to be manipulated\nIn today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In\u00a0this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker.\nIn his 1874 essay On Nature, this was one of the main problems with making \"appeals to nature\" that philosopher John Stuart Mill pointed out. \"Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills; torture because nature tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but do what it is good to do.\" In other words: if the premise of the appeal to nature is correct that anything \"natural\" must be better, because it's natural, then we have to be willing to embrace everything that comes from nature. If we aren't, well, we probably don't really believe something is inherently better because it's natural.\nMeanwhile, there are hundreds of things that we might consider not to be natural that, in fact, have made life quite a lot better for many of us. Prior to modern medicine, more than one in 100 women died in childbirth. In wealthy, industrialised countries such as the UK today, it is more like one in 10,000. Before vaccinations were rolled out globally, whooping cough (pertussis) killed one out of every 10 children infected. After the global roll-out, deaths fell to a fraction \u2013 1/157, specifically \u2013 of what they had been before.\nThat's just medicine. Look around you right now, and you'll see a dozen more examples. It's may not be \"natural\" to wear glasses, refrigerate food, or turn on the heating in winter, for example \u2013 but for many of us, it's a better alternative than walking around near-blind, leaving meat to spoil or shivering in the cold.\nMuch of the food we eat does not come to us as nature presents it. We process and cook it. The harvesting, grinding and processing of grains helped to drive the transition of our species from being nomadic hunter gatherers into settled farmers capable of building sophisticated civilisations. So, too, did the way in which we cultivated and cross-bred crops \u2013 meaning that many of the nutritious foods we consider \"natural\" today, from the orange carrot to the modern banana, look (and taste) far different than their wild forebears.\nOf course, it would be wrong to suggest that human-made products don't also cause us problems, whether pollution from synthetic plastics to the use of guns and explosives. Nor does it mean that, in many cases, the more \"natural\" option is not better for us. But it does mean that we cannot assume the more \"natural\" option is better just because it's natural \u2013 despite a frequent tendency for people to believe the contrary. Carrots might be better for us than crisps, but so too is paracetamol versus arsenic.\nSome of these examples hint at one of the other main problems with the \"appeal to nature\" \u2013 how can you delineate what is, and what isn't, natural at all? Humans, after all, come from nature. So, if anything an animal or plant produces is \"natural\", why isn't anything that humans do? And what of those creations that are blends of what we'd traditionally consider natural and man-made \u2013 like vaccinations, which are derived from the parts of a (natural) virus or bacteria, and, when injected, help teach your immune system how to (naturally) fend off that same pathogen in the future?\n\"Like all truly interesting words, 'nature' is a mille-feuille of meanings,\" writes the science historian Lorraine Daston. It can mean almost anything, depending on the context. This slipperiness, of course, is exactly what makes it such clever language for marketing \u2013 and makes it so easy for us to fall for.\nThere's another problem, too: even if there were a clear-cut delineation between \"humans\" and \"nature\", we're often not very good at knowing what is actually synthetic, versus what is not.\nTake brushing our teeth. Is it natural to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste? What about to brush your teeth with a non-fluoride toothpaste?\nFor many of us, our instinct might be to say that brushing with fluoride is unnatural, while brushing with non-fluoride toothpaste is natural. But fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that can be found in soil, water and rocks, while one of its common replacements in \"natural\" toothpastes, nano-hydroxyapatite, is synthetic. And, of course, we'd need to consider that cleaning one's teeth, certainly with the items we use today, is far from natural; the closest primates get to brushing their teeth is \"flossing\" with whatever is on hand (like bird feathers). Even if we wanted to brush our teeth the way that our human ancestors did, we'd need to scrub our teeth with a twig, pig hairs or even porcupine quills.\nMeanwhile, if I told you that I had made a drink for you that was made up of 99% dihydrogen monoxide, would you recoil? This chemical name sounds pretty synthetic, after all, until you think about it.\nDihydrogen monoxide is, of course, two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. You might be more familiar to see it written in chemical shorthand: H2O. In other words, water.\nThe next time you see a product being marketed on the basis that it is natural \u2013 or see someone arguing against something because it is not \u2013 it is worth questioning what is really being meant. And, perhaps, questioning why it is that those behind the product or practice are leaning on the \"appeal to nature\" fallacy to persuade an audience of its merits \u2013 rather than simply laying out the logical argument for just why it is actually the better option.\n* Amanda Ruggeri is an award-winning science and features journalist.

        "article_text": "Becoming Led Zeppelin is a new authorised documentary that tells the \"untold story\" of the band, who despite achieving global influence and legendary status, are difficult to define.\nRock's mightiest anthems, and the tales surrounding them, tend to be continually replayed \u2013 and sometimes, their power fades over time. Since their 1968 formation, though, Led Zeppelin's legendary status, and mythology, has particularly endured. The British quartet \u2013 driven visionary guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, extravagantly swaggering vocalist Robert Plant, and the poetic powerhouse rhythm section of bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham \u2013 have remained instantly recognisable and globally influential, yet tricky to pin down. Their multi-million-selling catalogue is laced with blues, hard rock, folk fables, African, Asian and Latin grooves, macho bombast and avant-garde flair. They gained a rep for scandalous excess, while mostly shunning the press \u2013 but now Becoming Led Zeppelin, their first officially authorised documentary, promises to capture the band's \"untold story\" for posterity.\nThis film's long-awaited cinema release follows a \"work in progress\" screening at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. Becoming Led Zeppelin also forms a natural progression for filmmakers Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, following their award-winning 2017 doc series, American Epic, traced the history and impact of America's earliest roots music recordings.\n\"We wanted to do a film that would pick up the next era,\" MacMahon tells the BBC. \"Rather than looking at 100 acts, like we did with American Epic, we looked at whether there was one act that carried that music through from post-World War Two to the 60s and 70s, and were the embodiment of that final stage of 20th-Century music \u2013 and we realised it was Zeppelin.\"\nGetting Led Zeppelin's surviving members on board involved a meticulously fine-tuned pitch \u2013 but it was also pivotal that Page, Plant and Jones were fans of MacMahon and McGourty's previous work; American Epic documented their own musical heroes. \"Becoming Led Zeppelin wouldn't have happened without American Epic,\" admits McMahon.\nStill, Plant warned the film-makers: \"I don't think this film can be made, as we didn't do any TV, and Peter Grant [Led Zeppelin's formidable manager, who died in 1995] would eject audience members with cameras from the venues, rip out their film and smash their cameras, so there isn't any footage of our concerts from those years.\"\nIn fact, Becoming Led Zeppelin features two hours of painstakingly sourced archive material, personal photos and performance footage (schoolboy Page playing in a skiffle band; teenage Jones as a church organist; both becoming accomplished session musicians on '60s pop hits) alongside individual new interviews from Page, Plant and Jones. Bonham's death in 1980 (from pulmonary aspiration after heavy drinking) would lead to the band's split \u2013 yet he is also surprisingly present here, sounding jovially down-to-earth on a previously unheard audio recording.\u00a0\nAs a child, MacMahon had \"discovered\" Led Zeppelin via a book charting the band's rise to fame. \"It felt like the American Epic stories, in that it's very relatable: these are four kids, pursuing this dream, and trying to find their way through the music business,\" he grins. \"I thought it was a wonderful, almost Arthurian story.\" This fantastical spirit is echoed in the film, when Page likens his guitar to Excalibur, the mythical sword.\u00a0\nWhile the \"untold story\" is steered by the band members' anecdotes, they're not strictly the easiest interviewees \u2013 though perhaps this perception is based on my own surreal experience interviewing Page and Plant, when I was a gauche young journalist; they cheerfully shrugged off questions while pouring me cups of tea. Ultimately, it is the music that really speaks volumes. Becoming Led Zeppelin pays testimony to music as a revelatory force, for both fans and performers; octogenarian Page is wide-eyed as he relates first hearing US R&B and soul (\"It sounded like it was coming from Mars, even though it was coming from Memphis\"). The artists' raw hunger and determination is palpable; we see Plant shape-shift through various looks (mod; \"flower power\" romantic) before assuming his unmistakeably lithe \"rock deity\" form in Led Zeppelin \u2013 and we watch the band play their hearts out, first commanding fans across Stateside gigs and radio, before their eventual triumphant 1970 \"homecoming\" show at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\"We used lots of cinematic techniques to take the viewer back in time,\" says McGourty. \"And we use the song lyrics to propel you forward; when they go to Atlantic Records, we're hearing Your Time Is Going To Come; when Robert [Plant] talks about flying across America, we're hearing Ramble On; and when they're playing these early shows in Europe and nobody is really getting it, they're performing Communication Breakdown.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The band that soundtracked the US counterculture\n\u2022\u00a0The most blistering debut album of all time\n\u2022\u00a0How the Sex Pistols sparked outrage in Britain\nIndeed, there is brilliant early footage from a French TV show, Tous En Scene, where Led Zeppelin are riotously rocking in front of clearly nonplussed studio audience, comprising prim adults and children with their fingers in their ears. Later, we hear the inception of one of their most famous tracks, 1969's Whole Lotta Love (furiously catchy, despite Page's aversion to pop), and see extended performance clips including the 1970 Bath Festival \u2013 all incandescent, electric and floridly colourful. You get some sense of the intoxicating atmosphere that would even prompt cult novelist William Burroughs to liken a Led Zeppelin performance (in the US in 1975) to: \"the trance music found in Morocco, which is magical in origin and purpose \u2013 that is, concerned with the evocation and control of spiritual forces.\"\n\"If you're making a film about music, then music is the central character, and the viewers \u2013 particularly 100 years from now \u2013 have got to hear for themselves what this music is,\" says MacMahon.\nMusic writer, Mojo magazine Contributing Editor, broadcaster and producer Phil Alexander has worked closely with Page, Plant and Jones, and points out why Led Zeppelin's \"kinetic energy\" remains vital: \"Led Zeppelin are not best mates; it's really obvious in the film,\" Alexander tells the BBC. \"Their camaraderie stems from being on stage, and playing off each other. That pure musicianship is what carries them as people \u2013 and what they create as a four-piece cannot be replicated.\n\"If anybody across any generation listens to that band \u2013 especially now, when you can discover them at the click of a button \u2013 you fall into a world that doesn't look or sound like anything else. I think most bands of their generation sound like they are of a time; with Led Zeppelin, there is a nowness in how they are, musically. I don't know how many times I've listened to all their albums, and I still find things that make me think: did I hear that before?\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin vividly presents the band's origin story \"in the moment\"; events unfold chronologically, without hazy nostalgia or foreshadowing of what's to come. The \"untold\" tale is also undeniably incomplete; the film ends after the release of the band's second album, when they have scaled the heights of fame \u2013 and before things have spiralled into destructive hedonism. Despite Plant briefly mentioning \"girls and drugs\", the account feels unusually wholesome. It is a stark contrast to the tabloid accounts of their debauchery \u2013 most notoriously, the grimly salacious (which band members have repeatedly dissociated themselves from) band biography Hammer of the Gods, by Stephen Davis. This feels very deliberate; just as American Epic has been added to educational curricula in the US, Becoming Led Zeppelin is pitched at all ages \u2013 with the band not only preserving their legacy, but owning their narrative.\n\"Despite all the things you've read about the 70s, you don't get to that place without being incredibly focused,\" says MacMahon. \"The higher purpose of this film is to tell young people: if you have a passion, and you work hard at your craft and persevere, then you can achieve those dreams. You kind of pick up these lessons as you go on the journey with them. These are the only guys that knew and saw what was happening.\"\nBecoming Led Zeppelin is in UK cinemas and on limited release in the US now \u2013 it goes on wide release in the US on 14 Feb.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The Uzbekistan government is on an ambitious tourism drive \u2013 but is sparring with heritage experts over how to protect its historical sites.\nThe sound of a jackhammer rattles through the air. In Bukhara, a former trading hub on the ancient Silk Road in what is now Uzbekistan, tourism is the new commerce and new hotels are popping up on every street corner. I've counted three construction sites in a 100m radius outside the former caravanserai where I'm staying, and I observe the progress of a guesthouse being built just metres from a 16th-Century madrasa (school).\u00a0\nIt's a trend that's visible across the country. In the capital, Tashkent, construction work for a shopping mall lines the avenue leading up to the Hazrati Imam mosque complex, next to the shiny, almost-completed Centre for Islamic Civilisation. The small historic city of Khiva, surrounded by mud fortifications, cannot expand outwards \u2013 but mud-and-straw residences in the historic centre are being knocked down and replaced by modern hotels. It is perhaps most obvious in Samarkand, where billionaire businessman Bakhtiyor Fazilov has poured money into flashy projects to raise his home city's profile, such as a new airline, an international airport that opened in 2022 and the strange Disneyland facsimile Silk Road Samarkand, a soulless and sanitised tourist resort situated outside the city.\n\"The concept of the Silk Road is being applied to everything,\" said Svetlana Gorshenina, a researcher and member of the Uzbek heritage protection association Alerte H\u00e9ritage. \"You have Silk Road restaurants, Silk Road shops, Silk Road tours, tourist agencies uniquely dedicated to the Silk Road. It has become our only selling point and it's self-exoticising. It's a kind of self-orientalisation, which is a hangover from colonialism.\"\u00a0\nThe thing is: it's working. The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index now ranks Uzbekistan at 78th out of 119 countries, moving up 16 places in the last five years. The Uzbek government is ploughing investment into its tourism sector after the country's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, laid out his Uzbekistan 2030 strategy in September 2023, an enormous governmental plan detailing the goals to be achieved in various sectors by that date. That includes increasing the number of foreign tourists to 15 million, more than double the 6.6 million visitors to the country in 2023. He has also called for the creation of \"tourist clusters\" \u2013 complexes providing accommodation and other services for tourists in one place.\u00a0\nOne of these new clusters is the reason I've come to Bukhara. It's a 33-hectare site on the fringes of the old town on which a leisure complex called\u00a0Eternal Bukhara\u00a0will soon be built. Samarkand tycoon Fazilov has a hand in this project too: he's the chairman of one of Uzbekistan's largest contractors, Enter Engineering, which is building the complex. The company is cagey about its actual plans for the site \u2013 not least because it has already proven quite contentious.\nInitial plans reported in the local press described it as an \"ethnographic park\" that would recreate traditional Uzbek buildings such as\u00a0chaikhanas\u00a0(teahouses), as well as restaurants serving Uzbek cuisine and a museum about Uzbek culture. But the 3D renderings pasted on the high walls that surround the construction site show instead blocky, modernist shopping arcades and glimmering pools adorned with abstract art.\u00a0\n\"We're not trying to replicate historic buildings. We don't want to repeat history \u2013 but to create something that will have its own impact,\" Rustam Khaydarov, the deputy general director of Enter Engineering, told me, as we sat in a portacabin in the construction site with excavators and diggers whirring nearby. \"It will be a place where people can relax, with cafes and a cultural centre for local artists to display their art. And about 70% of it will remain a green site.\"\nEnter Engineering also plans to build a number of five-star hotels, with up to 700 rooms on site. \"Wealthy people already come to Bukhara but are dissatisfied with the quality of the hotels. So we want to improve the class of hotels on offer,\" he said. There will also be medical facilities to cater to a new type of tourist that Uzbekistan is trying to attract: visitors who come for cheap healthcare, from dentistry to plastic surgery.\nThis area used to be Bukhara's administrative zone, with government offices and a large public sports arena. The demolition of the sports stadium im 2024 provoked a public outcry (which is rare in Uzbekistan, a country where public dissent is swiftly silenced), and Enter Engineering responded by building three more sports facilities on the town's outskirts. The site is ringed by a road, beyond which there are drab and semi-dilapidated residential apartment blocks, with many ground-floor spaces for businesses unoccupied. Although it's just a short walk to Bukhara's tourist sites and monuments, it feels a world away from the relentless tourism of the city centre.\nGet off the tourist trail\nMany travellers head from Samarkand to Khiva but don't hesitate to go off the beaten path. Here are some ideas:\n\u2022\u00a0Rent a car or book a tour to visit the ancient Khorezm fortresses and Zoroastrian sites on the road between Nukus and Urgench, where you can scramble around the desert ruins, poke into chambers and walk along walls that were built between the 4th Century BCE and the 7th Century CE.\n\u2022\u00a0The city of Nukus is a rapidly developing tourist destination, known above all for the Nukus Museum of Art's extensive collection of Russian avant-garde art.\n\u2022 Go to the Fergana Valley for a slower pace of travel. Spending time in a teahouse in a rural mountain village will give you a better understanding of how people live in Uzbekistan.\n\"For years, Uzbekistan has been undergoing a process of emptying city centres of their inhabitants,\" explained Gorshenina. \"We are witnessing a transformation of towns into museum-towns that are made for tourists. In Bukhara, you already have this 'tourist zone' that is clearly separate from the rest of the town where residents live. It's become an open-air museum.\"\nAn Uzbek architect, who did not want to be named for this article but whom I met in his office in Bukhara, told me, \"Every year, there are more and more tourists. I have always thought of Bukhara as a living organism, and that organism is becoming very weak and fragile. It should not become a town solely for tourists but for its residents as well. It risks becoming a Venice in the desert.\"\nAlerte H\u00e9ritage is fiercely opposed to the Eternal Bukhara project, in part because it says that locals were not consulted about the use of the space, and also because of the loss of important Soviet-era architecture, such as a government building that was the former regional headquarters of the Communist Party, built in 1987. It was torn down in early 2024.\nThe Uzbek architect said that the current government was repeating mistakes from the Soviet era. \"The Soviet Union destroyed a lot of heritage and replaced it with Soviet buildings because it wanted to leave its own imprint. That tradition of demolition is still \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 in our blood.\"\nAlthough Eternal Bukhara is not within the historical centre that is classified as a Unesco World Heritage site, it falls within the \"buffer zone\", which still requires Unesco validation before urban changes can be made. When contacted, a spokesperson for Unesco, said that they were \"closely monitoring\" the situation, adding: \"We hope that the authorities will comply with their commitments to the World Heritage Convention and that they will not carry out any demolition/construction project without the prior assessment of the World Heritage Committee in July 2025.\"\nDemolition on the Eternal Bukhara site is visibly ongoing, with only a handful of buildings still standing. That seems problematic for Unesco \u2013 even more so as the international organisation plans to host this year's General Conference in Uzbekistan, which would be the first time since 1986 that the annual meeting has been held outside Paris.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Central Asia's glittering new Silk Road jewel\n\u2022\u00a0 Plov: Uzbekistan's rice dish with 'sexual power'\n\u2022\u00a0 The Silk Road city most tourists miss\n\"Unesco is toothless, without principles. What has it really done for Central Asia, for Uzbekistan?\" asked the Uzbek architect. Both he and Alerte H\u00e9ritage are unconvinced by Unesco's warnings to Enter Engineering. Khaydarov, however, assured me that the company will not launch any building work until they get Unesco's green light \u2013 which means that they could still be waiting for months before construction is able to begin.\n\"We don't want the city's image to be damaged,\" Khaydarov said. \"This is a reputational issue. But we chose this area because it's in the buffer zone and we are confident we will get Unesco's approval to continue.\"\nHe also insisted that locals support the plans, describing it as \"a social project\" rather than a commercial one. \"We will create minimum 15,000 jobs with this site,\" he promised.\nUzbekistan's headlong rush into the world of mass tourism could well create thousands of jobs and boost the country's economy \u2013 but it risks bulldozing or damaging both the country's ancient heritage and vestiges of its more recent history. You only have to walk through Bukhara's covered bazaars that were once filled with Uzbek silk and crafts and are now teeming with imported, mass-produced goods to get a feel for what the country may look like in just a few years.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In 1966, the BBC's Tomorrow's World visited a party in New York organised by the electronic dating service Tact, or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing. Around 2,000 singles were invited to Manhattan to try out this modern method of matchmaking.\nIn 1788, a man going by the name of \"AB\" placed New York's first known personal ad in the Impartial Gazetteer, according to historian Francesa Beauman. He was seeking a woman \"under 40, not deformed, and in possession of at least one thousand pounds\". Describing himself as \"a young gentleman of family and fortune, who is lately come to town\", the ad was the Tinder bio of its day. Whether AB had any replies to his ad is unknown. But nearly 200 years later, New York was the home of another novel approach to dating \u2013 computer matchmaking.\nInvented by Bob Ross (a computer programmer at IBM, not the painter), and accountant Lewis Altfest, Tact \u2013 or Technical Automated Compatibility Testing \u2013 launched in New York 60 years ago, in 1965. First confined to the Upper East Side, it soon expanded to the entire city and had thousands signing up to be matched by computer. Each hopeful had to pay $5 (\u00a32) and fill in a questionnaire, which would then be used to match people \"on three levels\", according to Ross: socio-cultural factors, opinions and values, and psychological factors. The answers were fed into the computer, which would then spit out supposed matches of the opposite gender. Same-sex dating was not an option. \"Tact is not a lonely-hearts club,\" Ross told the BBC's Tomorrow's World. \"It's not a marriage brokerage service. It's a new fun way of meeting new people.\" He pointed out that it was open to \"all fun-loving people between 18 and 45\", and added: \"People go into Tact for a number of reasons. Some of the people go into it just to meet new people, to get a lot of dates\u2026 some people want to get more serious, they are interested in forming a more lasting relationship, and then there are people who just want to get married.\"\nThe matchmaking questions were approved by psychologist Dr Salvatore V Didato, who felt there was \"a great social need\" for services such as Tact. He complained of other services, \"They say that they match people on many, many variables, but it winds up that they match them only on age, sex, religion, and height, or something like that.\" The Tact questionnaire went further by including a series of statements with which respondents had to either agree or disagree. The BBC report features responses from a typical customer: \"I worry over my relationships with people \u2013 yes. I enjoy people who express affection freely \u2013 yes. Most of the time I act as an independent \u2013 no. I enjoy going to parties \u2013 yes.\"\nWhile Tact was at the crest of a new technological wave, it was not quite the first computer-aided dating service. The two inventors had been inspired by Operation Match, which had been started earlier that year by Harvard students \u2013 decades before some students at the same university would create another computer-powered way for people to connect: Facebook.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nIn 1965, computers were still novel. Operation Match had to rent one of the university's computers for $100 an hour. It quickly proved popular, with thousands of students sending in questionnaires. \"You thought the computer was god, and the computer knew all,\" co-creator Jeff Tarr told the BBC's\u00a0Witness History\u00a0in 2014. Coincidentally, Tarr's daughter would go on to marry one of the creators of Match.com, one of the first internet dating sites. The computer provided reassurance: instead of relying on luck when finding your partner, you could be algorithmically matched to your soulmate.\nThe 1960s were a time of revolution. In the United States, the civil rights and second wave feminism movements were in full flow. Social norms were changing, and technology was developing quickly, too: the arrival of the computer coincided with society's increased permissiveness. By 1969, computer dating \u2013 or at least the idea of it \u2013 was mainstream enough to feature as a storyline in Bewitched, the supernatural sitcom. Samantha's cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery plays both characters) signs up to a computer dating service to find a mortal to marry, only to be matched with a warlock. Even Bob Ross himself found love through Tact \u2013 although it wasn't thanks to the computer. According to a New Yorker article published in the New Yorker in 2011, he eventually married a journalist who interviewed him about the project.\nTact's thousands of willing customers signalled a shift away from the more formal courtship culture of the first half of the century, and towards more modern attitudes. However, these early computer matchmaking services did not last long. While some people found their perfect partners, the services had a few fatal limitations. Because the services were primarily aimed at middle-class college students and graduates, there was a finite pool of potential matches. Also, the system was inefficient \u2013 it could be weeks between sending off your questionnaire and receiving your matches, who you then had to contact by phone or post. The parties organised by Tact were an attempt to get matches to mingle despite the distances that might be involved. Even then, it could still be awkward. The BBC's report pointed out that even \"a public relations man present couldn't get this party going until after dark,\" despite a prize of \"a big night out on the town\" for the most compatible couple present. Possibly the paper sign hung between two bins did not inspire confidence in the service.\nThe questions left something to be desired, too. As well as all the basic demographic and attraction-related queries, the form's \"dislikes\" section had options such as \"homosexuals\" and \"interracial couples\". The questionnaire also played to stereotypes: according to the New Yorker, men were asked to rank women's hairstyles, whereas women could specify where they could find their ideal man: chopping wood, painting in a studio, or in a garage.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The risqu\u00e9 romcom that defined a genre\n\u2022\u00a0The man behind the puzzle that 99% can't solve\n\u2022\u00a0Gloria Steinem on the trailblazing Ms Magazine\nWhile the creators were proud of the detail in their \"three levels\" of compatibility testing, their Cupid's arrows weren't always on target. \"We matched an older brother with his younger sister,\" admitted Ross. \"That didn't work out too well.\" He also said they'd had \"a number of people who weren't too satisfied after they've gone out\". On Tomorrow's World, one potential client quizzed Dr Didato on the robustness of the matching computer, after a bad experience with another service. \"She specified an age limit and gets some guy 20 years older!\"\nStill, while Tact, Operation Match and other similar services now seem comparatively quaint, people keep using technology to guide them towards romance \u2013 from the first personal ads in newspapers to video dating services, from online dating sites to AI-aided apps. According to Pew Research, one in 10 people who had partners in the US in 2023 met them via online dating. When it comes to matters of the heart, it seems, we can't help falling in love with the latest innovations.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Fingernails help protect the underlying skin from injury, and they also come in handy when you want to scratch an itch or peel a satsuma. But what do they reveal about your health?\n*\u00a0All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional. The BBC is not responsible or liable for any diagnosis made by a user based on the content of this site. The BBC is not liable for the contents of any external internet sites listed, nor does it endorse any commercial product or service mentioned or advised on any of the sites. Always consult your own GP if you're in any way concerned about your health.\u00a0\nThere's no shortage of folk wisdom about how to glean the state of your overall health from your nails, such as the pervasive idea that the white flecks that sometimes turn up \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are a sign of calcium deficiency. But is there any truth to these ideas?\nFirst up some basic anatomy. Nails are an extension of the skin. They are made from keratin, a super tough protein that shields the toes and tops of your fingers from trauma. The half-moon shape seen at the base of the nail is the lunula, which serves as the \"growth centre\" for the nail, producing the cells that will eventually harden into the nail plate . It sits above the cuticle, a layer of dead cells joining the base of the nailbed to the skin. The cuticle offers extra protection by acting as the nail's security guard, stopping bacteria, fungi and other pathogens in their tracks.\nWhile the eyes might be the windows to the soul, to a doctor the nails can be the windows to your health. Physicians can use them to diagnose all sorts of conditions, from dermatological problems to kidney disease or even autoimmune disorders.\n\"One of the first things I learned in medical school was to look for something called clubbing, where there is this loss of the angle between the nail and the nail bed itself,\" says Dan Baumgardt, a general practitioner in medicine and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol.\u00a0\nWith clubbing, the nail beds soften, and the nails almost seem to \"float\" instead of being firmly attached to the finger. The fingertips also appear large or bulging. \"It causes an unusual sort of swollen finger appearance where the finger looks a little bit like a drumstick,\" says Baumgardt.\nClubbing is a sign of extremely low blood oxygen levels. It is most commonly associated with lung cancer, but it can also indicate an infection of the lining of the heart chambers and heart valves, among other things. Other conditions where it is observed include celiac disease, cirrhosis of the liver and lung infections amongst others.\n\"If you do see a patient with clubbing the rule of thumb is to get them an x-ray as an urgency, because it could be an underlying lung cancer that could be explaining it,\" says Baumgardt. \"Having said that even though it's one of the first things that we learned in medical school. I really don't know why, because in all the 14 years I've been a doctor, I've only ever seen it once,\" he says.\nWhite flecks on the nail \u2013 known as leukonychia \u2013 are often touted to be a sign of vitamin or mineral deficiencies. However, the evidence to support this is mixed. In one small study of undergraduates, there was no correlation between this symptom and a person's intake of either zinc or calcium. However, in one case report of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe leukonychia on his fingernails while deficient in selenium, it disappeared after treatment with this mineral.\nIn general, leukonychia are more likely to be a result of nail trauma. Stubbing your toe, trapping your fingernail in a door, too many manicures, or dropping a heavy object on your foot may cause such a mark.\nNevertheless, white discolouration on the nail could suggest an underlying health issue. For instance, white marks can be a sign of heavy metal poisoning with lead or arsenic. White discolouration of the nail could be a sign of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition that causes raised, inflamed, scaly patches of skin. If the entire nail turns white, this could suggest a deficiency of protein in the bloodstream, which can indicate kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If people have low protein levels in their bloodstream it [often] causes the whole nail to go white,\" says Baumgardt. \"We tend to associate that with people who've got liver disease, so things like cirrhosis of the liver, perhaps as a result of alcoholism.\"\u00a0\nBlue nails, on the other hand, are a sign that the body might be lacking oxygen. It could be a sign of serious heart disease or emphysema and is something you should get checked out by a doctor as soon as possible. This is also the case if you see dark lines underneath the nail, as although this can be caused by trauma, it could also be a sign of subungual melanoma, a rare but serious type of skin cancer.\nBleeding beneath the nail \u2013 if it doesn't heal \u2013 could also indicate something more serious. \"You can get what we call splinter haemorrhages, which look like little red streaks of blood, similar to if you imagine a splinter stuck under your nail,\" says Baumgardt. \"That haemorrhage can sometimes be suggestive of vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. One of the main underlying causes can be an infection of the heart valve, which causes these odd little red swellings,\" he says.\nOther, more common conditions can also be diagnosed by looking at the nails. When examining a patient, doctors typically look for alterations in colour, thickness and shape.\nFor example, in a healthy nail the underlying nail bed should be pink except for the white tips. Other colours could indicate an infection of the nail itself, or an underlying health condition.\n\"If you see either white or yellow discolouration on your toes, especially on your toenails, that is a sign of a fungal infection,\" says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull.\nAlthough in many countries, such as the US and the UK, you can buy over-the-counter topical medication for mild fungal nail infections, if you leave it too late then it can become more difficult to treat. (It's important to always consult a doctor if you suspect that you have a nail infection.)\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of the time when people have discolouration in the nails they don't realise that it's an infection, so it can get to a point where it becomes quite bad, and then they have to go and see a podiatrist,\" says Wilkinson.\nMeanwhile the shape of the nail can also reveal underlying problems. Healthy toe and fingernails should be convex, which means they curve slightly outwards. They shouldn't contain any dips or craters. If they do, it may be a sign that you have koilonychia, a condition where the nail curves inwards and looks thin and brittle. In some cases, people with koilonychia have a central depression in their nail deep enough to hold a drop of fluid, hence the condition is often referred to as \"spoon nails\".\u00a0\nIf your any of your nails bear a resemblance to a spoon, this could be a sign of anaemia, when the body doesn't have enough healthy blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency. However, it can also be a sign of coeliac disease, among other conditions.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, some changes in the nail can indicate nutritional deficiencies. Some people have horizontal ridges, known as Beau's lines, that run horizontally across their nails. This could indicate a deficiency such as insufficient protein. However, this feature could also be a sign of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease \u2013 a disorder involving reduced circulation of blood to certain parts of the body, usually due to the buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries \u2013 so it is still important to get it checked out.\n\"Beau's lines can indicate zinc deficiency, while brittle nails are a sign of hypothyroidism or vitamin B7 deficiency,\" says Mary Pearson, a paediatrician working at the University Hospital of Wales. \"In some cases we might be more diligent about looking for these, for example in safeguarding cases where we are concerned about a child's nutrition, or where we suspect chronic disease,\" she says.\nIn other cases, nail changes may be caused by lifestyle factors rather than health problems. For example peeling nails, also known as\u00a0onychoschizia, occurs when thin layers of the nails literally separate from the free nail edge and peel back. \"Onychoschizia may be the result of excessive hand washing, nail dryness, and the use of acrylics and other nail polishes,\" says Joshua Zeichner, professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital\u00a0in New York.\u00a0\nYou may wonder what it is about nails that makes them so revealing of a person's underlying health. One of the main reasons is that nails are obviously one of the few parts of the body that you can see from the outside.\n\"Nails are extensions of the skin, effectively, and your skin can tell you so much about what's going on in your body,\" says Baumgardt. \"Your first impression of a patient often starts from the bedside, so you look them all over and you start off with their nails, you look in their eyes and their mouth. And you start to do an end-of-the-bed assessment, trying to pick out diagnostic pictures from that point early on. So nails are one of the first things we see,\" he says.\nWhile most of the time changes in the nail are harmless, and are simply down to a nail injury, if you notice that the change in shape, colour, or texture is more permanent, then you should always consult the advice of a doctor.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Some species of birds like geese save energy by flying in close formation. Airliners could use a similar trick to burn less fuel.\nIn the early 1500s, Italian Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci developed a fascination with avian flight. He spent his days meticulously studying the movement of birds, sketching observations of how they maintain their balance and perform soaring manoeuvres.\nHis ambition was to make a flying machine from his scientific investigations. But what he wound up creating instead was the seminal work\u00a0Codex on the Flight of Birds. It pioneered what would later become the field of \"biomimicry\", the study of the natural world in search of efficient design.\u00a0\nCenturies later, experimentation flourished. Pioneering aviators like Otto Lilienthal, Igo Etrich and the Wright brothers mimicked birds to design their aircraft and the aviation industry was born.\nIn 2019, Airbus returned to the study of birds with the \"fello'fly\" project to understand how migrating geese conserve energy while flying in V formation. From it, a\u00a0\"wake energy retrieval\" technique was developed to help\u00a0trailing jets\u00a0pinpoint the optimal location to fly in the wake vortex of a lead jet. This was found to generate fuel savings of 5% to 10% per\u00a0trip, similar to\u00a0findings published by the US space agency Nasa.\u00a0\nIn July 2023, the effort evolved into the\u00a0Geese project\u00a0with\u00a0\u20ac10m (\u00a38.4m/$10.5m)\u00a0in funding, and support from the European Union's air traffic management research arm, Sesar.\nEarlier this month, Delta Air Lines and Airbus announced that they were taking the \"fello'fly\" concept out of the lab and into the skies, targeting the second half of this year to deploy the technique into live operations. The goal will be to test a manoeuvre called \"rendez-vous\" in which two passenger jets are paired over the Atlantic Ocean. For example, this could be an Air France flight from New York City and a Delta Air Lines flight from Miami, both heading to London. In pairing, the two planes would be separated by the regulatory 1,000ft (303m) in altitude while attempting to\u00a0reduce the distance between them to\u00a01.2 nautical miles (2.2km), the same distance that fuel savings were most recently achieved in the lab.\nDelta chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca tells the BBC that this distance is substantially closer than planes fly today, which is typically at a separation of three to five nautical miles (5.5 to 9.2km), so the first step will be to see whether the gap can be narrowed without compromising safety.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0video\u00a0shows an animation of how \"fello'fly\" is expected to work.\nAs for why transatlantic flights were chosen for the test, DeLuca explains, \"there are very few sustainable solutions for wide bodies flying today, besides sustainable aviation fuel. So a 5% benefit off of a flight that's going across the Atlantic with a big airplane that's burning a lot of fuel has the biggest bang for the buck\".\nStephen Trent, an analyst at Citi, says on some routes the formation flying technique could be useuful. \"My guess is that it is also somewhat route dependent, and somewhat dependent on what kind of equipment you're operating. So the opportunity to do that, for example, flying from New York to London, is not going to be the same as an aircraft that's flying from Miami to Mexico City. It's possible that, in some cases, that's something that could help \u2013 like a tailwind that pushes a sailing ship.\"\nAiming to decarbonise operations by 2050, the Delta Carbon Council reported that it had saved\u00a041 million\u00a0gallons (65,800 tonnes) of jet fuel in 2024. DeLuca says that to achieve this, Delta is constantly on the lookout for new ways to conserve energy, like plugging into ground power instead of operating engines on the ground, doing a shorter vector on approach instead of a long roundabout when landing, and installing winglets that point up on the tips of wings to reduce drag.\nOther industry practices include\u00a0continuous climb and decline operations\u00a0that enable\u00a0an altitude to be reached without the need for levelling and\u00a0adjusting the centre of gravity\u00a0on the aircraft to reduce drag.\u00a0Switching to a renewable energy source like\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel is also seen as a solution, however this will require a staggering amount of land to grow enough biomass to make biofuels.\u00a0\u00a0\nDeLuca says Delta quadrupled\u00a0its\u00a0sustainable aircraft fuel\u00a0(SAF) usage\u00a0in 2024, but that's still less than 1% of the fuel\u00a0being used\u00a0with it. The main hurdle,\u00a0she says, is the supply of sustainable fuel. However, she's encouraged by Airbus joining Delta which has stated a commitment to purchase several million gallons of SAF annually starting in the second half of 2025.\nKnowing customers are lining up to buy the product gives farmers in rural communities a reason to redirect soy and corn ethanol production into sustainable aviation fuel, says DeLuca.\n\"It's really about economic and social development in rural communities \u2013 job creation, attracting investment into these communities. It's a new industry, so will be a big development opportunity for these sites,\" Airbus chief sustainability officer Julie Kitcher tells the BBC.\nTrent says sustainable aviation fuel won't yet be a silver bullet because it costs far more than conventional fuel. \"Let's say today jet fuel kerosene is like $2.50 (\u00a32) a gallon. If you look at SAF a gallon it can be more than three times that price... Assuming production needs to increase, then bring the price down.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Extreme flying in the name of science\n\u2022\u00a0Can we really fuel planes with fat and sugar?\n\u2022\u00a0How long-haul travel may change\nMeanwhile, across the airline industry, interest in biomimicry has been growing.\nAirbus has a project through its UpNext innovation lab\u00a0\u00a0taking inspiration from eagles, with the goal of creating longer, leaner and lighter high-performance, ultra-flexible wings that can bend and evolve depending on air current and turbulence, with hinges that adapt dynamically and sensors that can determine nuanced movements. It is similar to the morphing wing created by Nasa.\u00a0\nThey are not the only company looking into the technique. Boeing has a partnership with Nasa where it is testing coatings to reduce insect adhesion through the study of lotus leaves.\u00a0\nAnd Lufthansa has been working with chemicals manufacturer BASF on developing a surface film called AeroShark to simulate the texture of shark skin in an effort to save millions of tonnes of fuel per year.\n\"Birds are the experts of flight and so we're using nature to inspire technology,\" Kitcher says. For formation flying, they may be the greatest teachers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Food is life for this meal-obsessed island, especially when you're feeling poorly \u2013 including a spicy soup that soothes flu symptoms and a beloved chocolate drink that brings comfort.\nA few years ago, my girlfriend and I landed in Singapore after a winter holiday in Europe. Coughing, dizzy, our throats rusty and inflamed, we were far from well. But help was at hand. My (future) Singaporean mother-in-law came to the rescue, stocking our fridge with liquid medicine: congee. We spooned the thick, savoury rice porridge down our throats, feeling a little better with every swallow.\u00a0\nWarm and filling but gentle on the stomach, in good times congee is a power dinner in and of itself, and endlessly remixable. You can top it with a runny egg, chopped chives and coriander or neon splashes of garlic-chilli oil, and eat like a king. Or when sick, you can cut the tempting add-ons to a bare minimum and still be left with the soothing starch and heat. No wonder congee and its cousins are a key flu go-to in Singapore, Malaysia, China, South Korea \u2013 almost any place in East Asia where rice is a staple.\nSo strong is this porridge's connection to illness that some people can only stomach it when they're under the weather. Like Yuri Cath, a Japanese Indonesian who recently became a Singaporean citizen. \"I had a negative association with congee for the longest time because I only had it when I was sick,\" she says, echoing a sentiment of many locals. \"So, having it kind of made me feel ill.\" Not for long though, she laughs \u2013 the flavours won her over again, \"and I love congee now\".\nIt's tempting to call congee the king of flu food, but this is Singapore, one of the\u00a0most culinary-obsessed nations on Earth, and competition is fierce. A literal melting pot, the island's official languages are English, Tamil, Malay and Mandarin, representing the many cultures that form its core population. Each brings with it enough comfort dishes to soothe an army.\nWhere to eat yourself well in Singapore\nCongee:\u00a0Variety is the name of the game at\u00a0Mui Kee Congee, where your porridge can come loaded with sliced pork, beef, fish balls or abalone, to name just a few options.\n\nRasam:\u00a0Banana Leaf Apolo\u00a0boasts several locations, including one in the heart of Singapore's Little India. Their menu is extensive, but leave room for this stomach-settling dish.\nTamarind:\u00a0Looking for a food souvenir? Visit\u00a0DriedFoodSG, a multi-generation business brimming with dried goods, including tamarind paste or slices, which can be added to stews for an unmistakable flavour boost.\nBak kut teh:\u00a0Multiple businesses fight for the claim of best bak kut teh on bustling Balestier Road, including\u00a0Kai Juan Eating House\u00a0and the aptly named\u00a0Balestier Bak Kut Teh. The latter is open 24 hours a day.\nMilo:\u00a0Head to\u00a0Toast Box, a local cafe chain with more than 80 outlets famed as a popular pre-work breakfast spot. Order Milo hot or cold with kaya toast (bread with sweet coconut spread) on the side. A sugary but comforting pick-me-up.\nHippocrates would have liked this nation of six million hungry souls. The Ancient Greek thinker and physician, who once said, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,\" could witness his words come alive as a daily habit in Singapore's restaurants, homes and 120\u00a0hawker centres\u00a0boasting 6,000 stalls. Below are just some of the health-giving dishes and ingredients Hippocrates would approve of.\nSingaporean Syazana Izzati has vivid memories of her mother taking care of her when she was a child. Not with prescription pills, but with a long-held Malay practice that uses food as medicine.\n\"Whenever my siblings and I were running a fever, she used to do this thing where she'd wet our foreheads and hair,\" Izzati recalls. \"As we were lying down on bed, with a towel placed on our brow, she'd wet it with tamarind water.\" Why tamarind, or\u00a0asam\u00a0as it's known in Malay? \"Because it has cooling effects,\" she explains, \"and lowers the body temperature.\"\nTraditional Malay Medicine, like many ancient healing methods across Asia, leans deeply on jamu, or herbal and plant-based treatments like Izzati's fever poultice. \"These days, I just rely on painkillers,\" she laughs. But that may change, she says. Should she have children, she'll turn to tamarind on their feverish days \u2013 just like her mother and grandmother before her.\nBut tamarind is too popular to be used as a poultice alone. Some ingredients are so revered they crop up in other healing dishes, from cultures thousands of miles away.\nSome 5% of Singapore's population is made up of people with Indian Tamil heritage, who regularly turn to one of the tastiest flu cures you can fit in a bowl. Colourful but light, rasam, a broth originating in South India, is more than the sum of its parts. Its base consists of spices like pepper, turmeric and cumin along with garlic, onions and tomatoes \u2013 and, yes, tamarind again, in this case acting as a souring agent that gives the broth its addictive tart flavour. As a paper by two Indian medical researchers notes, rasam's ingredients are so therapeutic that the dish constitutes a \"functional food\", whose ingredients provide benefits above and beyond their nutritional value.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\". As local blogger Miss Vanda\u00a0noted\u00a0when she shared a rasam recipe online, \"This soup is a perfect remedy for flu,\" she wrote, calling it \"especially good for sore throats\".\nLike many ancient foods, the broth comes with a legend attached to it, one that bolsters rasam's reputation. Troubled by his ailing son's health and waning appetite, an ancient king of Madurai in Tamil Nadu province offered a reward for anyone who could make his child eat. One enterprising chef presented a humble bowl of rasam, which was promptly slurped up by the patient. Needless to say, the boy was soon healed.\nAnother broth with a historic backstory is bak kut teh, or pork rib soup. Made with long-simmered pork bones, lashings of pepper and a cornucopia of herbs, this salty, fatty meal was popular with Chinese coolies who came to Singapore in the 19th Century. Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nRasam's turmeric alone, the researchers explain, offers antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 perfect for soothing any ails. Not surprisingly, they add that rasam is \"an ideal recipe subscribing to the principles laid by Indian system[s] of medicine such as Ayurveda and Siddha\".

Bak kut teh, which translates to \"meat bone tea\", nourished many a labourer before their gruelling day.\nToday it remains a popular pick-me-up from the flu and is prized particularly for its decongestant properties. Bak kut teh is often eaten late at night, when the day is cooler. That's because it's considered a \"heaty\" soup in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) due to its herbal make-up. The spectrum of internal \"heatiness\" and \"cooling\" are core concepts within TCM, a popular practice in Singapore. Excessive heatiness, for example, may see the body erupt in a fever, sore throat and irritability, while the inverse can lead to paleness and fatigue. The key is to balance your warm yang energy with yin, its cooler counterpart.\nAce Tan, head chef at the newly opened fine-dining restaurant ASU, is a strong believer in this balance. His childhood was steeped in the ancient health system: Ace would often visit TCM stores run by his aunts and uncles. It spurred a passion in him to understand what ingredients affected the body, and how. \"The practice of consuming specific ingredients during each season is deeply rooted in the Asian philosophy of the five elements,\" Ace says: \"wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements are intricately connected to our body systems. By consuming certain ingredients, we nourish specific body parts, ensuring a continuous cycle of cultivation and overall well-being.\"\nSo how does Ace cool himself down when balance is disrupted? \"I do have a strong affiliation\u00a0towards\u00a0two drinks in particular,\" he says, both commonly drunk as teas: \"chrysanthemum and barley, as they help mitigate the heat of my body system, preventing sore throats and fever.\"\nSometimes, however, you just need comfort above all. That's where Milo comes in, a chocolate drink sold in practically every hawker centre in town. The brand is so beloved that a paper at the National University of Singapore Centre for Governance and Sustainability dryly noted: \"It has even humorously been suggested that Milo flows through the veins of Singaporeans.\"\nThey're not wrong. During the Covid-19 pandemic, ad-hoc medical centres gave thousands of patients a care package with critical necessities such as toothpaste, crackers \u2013 and sachets of Milo powder.\nThough it originated in Australia in the 1930s, Milo became popular in many British colonies in Asia, including Singapore. In a 2019 lecture at the National Museum of Singapore, historian Dr Geoffrey Pakiam explained how, once the island achieved independence in the mid-1960s (first from Britain, and then from the Federation of Malaysia, which it briefly joined), Milo was marketed \"as a national drink\". In 1984, Milo began to be manufactured locally as well, further cementing a homegrown connection with the beverage.\nWhat makes this best-selling drink such a treat for the poorly? In part, it's because Milo is an embedded part of childhood, served at school canteens, birthday parties and picnics. That connection continues as people age or join mandatory National Service (NS). Loong Lim, who served his NS decades ago, shares that \"for a lot of guys, Milo will still bring back memories of the night snack you get in the army, when training ends late.\" Drunk by young Singaporeans drenched in sweat and mud, Milo has revived many a tired soldier, who will likely serve it to their child one day should illness strike. Followed, perhaps, by a soothing bowl of congee.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Scientists and industry are finding unusual new uses for brewers' spent grain \u2013 the beer industry's largest waste product.\nPonder the idea of a beer well-brewed and enthusiastic drinkers at least are likely to imagine a pint glass filled to the brim with golden nectar.\u00a0\nWhat they probably won't picture is the mountains of wet sticky shavings that pile up as the largest waste material of brewing beer.\nThis is what's known as brewers' spent grain, and there is an awful lot of it. Around 200g (7oz) is produced for every litre of beer brewed. Globally some 37 million tonnes is produced each year \u2013 equivalent to the weight of around 340 double-decker buses per hour. And as we drink more beer \u2013 sales are expected to rise by a third in the next seven years \u2013 only more and more will be churned out.\nMost brewers' spent grain, around 70% of it, is currently repurposed as cattle feed, while 10% is used to make biogas. Around a fifth is simply sent straight to landfill \u2013 at an additional cost to breweries \u2013 where it rots and releases methane into the atmosphere.\nBut inside this beer by-product there are a mountain of useful chemicals to tap, including lots of protein. Researchers and companies are now beginning to explore how these could be put to better use.\u00a0\nSwiss start-up Upgrain is one of these. In 2024, it launched a processing system to turn brewers' spent grain into protein and fibre, passed as fit for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and the European Food Safety Authority (brewers' spent grain is, after all, still just grain). The system comes ready for installation on brewery premises: shipping container-sized for micro-breweries and a much larger unit for the likes of Brauerei Locher, Switzerland's second biggest brewer, which opened in September 2024 and is now building Europe's largest onsite facility.\nWilliam Beiskjaer, Upgrain's co-founder, argues brewers spent grain is a \"kind of hidden treasure in terms of sustainable and healthy nutrition\". He says it could help to tackle rising global demand for protein. \"There's more and more demand for our foods to be enhanced, especially to get more protein and fibre in our diets,\" he says.\nUpgrain and other producers such as Agrain in Denmark and BiaSol in Ireland are already selling brewers' spent grain protein and fibre extract to food manufacturers for inclusion in baked goods, pizzas, granola and even crisps. It's also being used in plant-based meat alternatives, such as those launched last year by the Swiss supermarket chain Migros, and in a coffee created by Singapore-based company Prefer.\nHype Metre\nBrewers' spent grain is a rich source of nutrients which is arguably wasted as cattle feed and produces methane when it ends up in landfill. A host of start-ups are now using it to make everything from vegan barley milk and leather to baked goods, crisps and even coffee; it even has potential to be used in areas like construction, cosmetics and paper.\nNot all these products are yet past the early stages of development, and products could struggle to see widespread consumer acceptance. Brewers' spent grain also uses lots of energy to process and spoils fast. Scientists and developers are already working to overcome these issues, however.\nHuge brewers such as the Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev and Chicago-based Molson Coors have even created their own vegan barley milk spin-offs made from spent grain. Molson Coors claims its Golden Wing product has a \"rich and creamy taste\" and 25% less sugar than most oat milks.\u00a0\n\"This is an exciting new idea,\" says Beiskjaer. \"If you'd have said to me four years ago that brewers' spent grain would be a [human] food source, I'd have asked what you were talking about. But we're on the way to seeing upcycled BSG as a staple in the food industry.\"\nBeiskjaer says he can see why some people may be squeamish about the notion of \"upcycled food\". \"But we have to get across the idea that brewers' spent grain is not a\u00a0waste\u00a0product,\" he says. \"It's being saved from being a waste product.\"\nMaking use of this waste product to make plant-based protein could in theory also free up the small amounts of arable farmland used to grow wheat, soy and pea for human protein \u2013 or, if it replaced meat, a far larger amount of land. \u00c4io, a biotech start-up based in Tallin, Estonia is using brewers' spent grain and other food and agricultural waste products to develop an alternative to palm oil, a major driver of deforestation in Indonesia and other countries. To do this \u00c4io grows fatty acid-making microorganisms and applies these to a fermentation process not dissimilar to that used in brewing beer.\nThere are some caveats to using brewers' spent grain in food, however. Since it is loaded with moisture and so spoils quickly, using it close to where it is produced is essential. This is one reason why a good proportion ends up in landfill: there's not enough demand from local farmers to meet supply. That dampness risks mould and microbial infection. In fact, says Beiskjaer, \"it becomes the perfect environment for bacteria unless it's quickly preserved\". Techniques for making preservation easier are now being explored.\nBut nutrition isn't the only area where spent grain could make an impact.\nBrett Cotten concedes that early efforts by his young London-based company, Arda Biomaterials, to create leather-alternatives from brewers' spent grain resulted in something more akin to a flapjack.\u00a0\nBut the start-up has since successfully used supramolecular chemistry to make several proteins from brewers' spent grain that mimic the animal proteins in leather, resulting in a strong and supple alternative. The colour reflects the spent grain used, he says. \"Guinness and stouts make for a naturally black material, IPAs and lagers more mid-browns.\"\u00a0\nCotten argues that to date many leather alternatives have either not been as environmentally sound as promised or are not scalable enough to replace animal leather. In contrast, he says, Arda's first test material was made in a home lab using standard kitchen equipment, using the abundant feedstock that is brewers' spent grain.\nSo far staff at the company and a local brewery have wear-trialled this new material with bags and cardholders. Current production is at lab scale, but a pilot facility set to open in London in 2025 will allow it to produce up to 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) a year, the company says.\nArda's own estimates suggest that, were a facility tied to a single major brewing plant \u2013 the likes of one run by Heineken or InBev \u2013 all of the spent grain being produced by the plant could make for 5-10 million sq m (54,000-108 sq ft) of its mid-range faux-leather, suitable for use in fashion and the automotive upholstery industries. Tied to, say, three major brewing facilities, it could undercut the cost of both real and plastics-based synthetic leathers, it argues. Cotten estimates that just 10% of global brewers' spent grain output would satisfy the global demand for leather.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Of course, the look and feel [of our material] is important, but so is scalability,\" says Cotten. \"The fashion industry just wants a new option [to animal or current bioleathers]. And while it's often happy to work with a batch of proof-of-concept material for a small collection, you have to be able to produce at scale to be of real interest.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The controversial device trapping CO2 in the ocean\n\u2022 What we've learned since Deepwater Horizon\n\u2022 The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery\nThat comes with a cost, however. Processing brewers' spent grain typically involves mechanical methods \u2013 using high pressure and temperature and spinning the grain in a centrifuge \u2013 or the use of strong acids and alkalis, all of which\u00a0are energy-intensive and can raise their own environmental questions. There is therefore an ongoing exploration of cheaper and more sophisticated methods to extract protein from spent grain, such as the use of bacteria and fungal enzymes to break down chemical bonds, for example.\u00a0\nLast year, a team in Singapore, funded by Heineken Asia, unveiled the use of fermentation to break down the chemical bonds in spent grain, which also resulted in the extracted protein \u2013 for use in foodstuffs \u2013 being richer in nutrients and fatty acids. In another step that might be widely applied, the researchers heated the spent grain using microwaves and found they could extract over 80% of its available protein content this way, the most harvested to date.\n\"Using microwaves is a difficult challenge, in their energy requirements, efficiency and scalability,\" says William Chen, professor of food science and technology at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore. \"But it's certainly possible to scale up [a microwave approach], or to find other ways of applying heat, through vibration, for example.\"\nThe overall objective is to move towards an \"ever more functional, higher value products\", he says. \"And we should be doing the same with [other protein-rich waste products such as] soybean residue, for example,\" he adds.\nArda's experiments may prove to be just the first steps in exploring the potential of spent grain beyond the edible. Antioxidant-rich brewers' spent grain could provide an eco-friendly alternative to the chemicals used in cosmetics, for instance, or used to replace the virgin fibres used in paper making.\u00a0\nRosa Arrigo, associate professor in inorganic chemistry at the University of Salford in the UK, says brewers' spent grain has a \"niche composition that's rich in chemicals [that] certainly have potential to [in time] be used to produce new materials\". Work at Salford to extract various organic compounds from brewers' spent grain is ongoing and Arrigo envisages these being used to make robust composite materials that could, for example, be bindable to the likes of concrete to make it stronger, more lightweight and more sustainable.\u00a0\n\"Certainly there's a whole other layer to what brewers' spent grain could bring beyond protein extraction for food,\" says Arrigo. \"Exactly what that is what we're now starting to examine.\" Doing this, though, could be expensive and complex, she adds. \"So we need further investigation to understand really what we have here, and what's actually needed by industry: what's good enough in terms of its quality but also economically feasible.\"\u00a0\nThe development of one such material is already underway: a group of researchers coordinated by University of Perugia, Italy, is currently working on a bioplastic derived from brewers' spent grain.\nCurrently, spent grain usually needs to be dried before it can be further processed, which is both time and energy consuming. But the Perugia team has developed a means of processing it while wet, critical to developing a bioplastic that could improve on the mechanical properties of those already available. The so-called Polymeer project hopes to have its first product \u2013 perhaps a biodegradable film wrap that could be used in packaging and agriculture \u2013 within four years.\n\"I think the true potential of brewers' spent grain has been overlooked, because even when the protein is removed there's still a lot of [useful] waste, the likes of lignin and cellulose, that has the potential to be a raw material [for other purposes],\" says Assunta Marrocchi associate professor in biotechnology at the University of Perugia and Polymeer's project coordinator. \"And the extraction of its additional components seems to be possible by relatively easy, low energy methods.\"\nBut what really matters here she adds, is that \"because almost everyone drinks beer, there's just so much of it to work with. It really is an incredible feedstock\".\nSo, the next time you're in the pub, perhaps you'll find yourself considering how the undertaking that put the beer in your glass might just prove an unexpected game-changer to both our diets and the materials we use.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.\nCarbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.\nIn October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.\nBut on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.\n\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.\nSpeaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.\n\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said. \nHe added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals. \nThe UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.\nBut a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.\nBoth the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\nBy 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.\nThe funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.\nDr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.\n\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.\nAlthough there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.\nBut Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.\nThe committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.\nThe committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.\nBut it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.\n\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.\nHis committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.\nThe government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.\n\nMirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.\n\"We argue that carbon storage mandates on fossil fuel producers are fair whilst also providing the kind of investment certainty that companies need,\" she said.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "summary": "Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology. \u00a322bn for 'unproven' green tech could raise bills, MPs warn8 days agoEsme StallardClimate and science reporter, BBC NewsLeon Neal/Getty ImagesNorway is one of the few countries globally with scaled carbon capture and storage facilitiesThe government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projectsWhat does net zero mean? \"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said. \"We argue that carbon storage mandates on fossil fuel producers are fair whilst also providing the kind of investment certainty that companies need,\" she said.Related internet linksPublic Accounts CommitteeA simple guide to climate changeFour ways climate change worsens extreme weatherWhat you can do to reduce carbon emissionsSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.",

        "article_text": "Scientists have cracked the perfect way to boil an egg \u2013 astonishingly, it takes half an hour.\nIt is one of the undisputed facts of life that it is notoriously difficult to cook a perfectly boiled egg. Breakfasts can often be disappointing affairs when, after cracking the shell and dipping your toasted soldier into what you hope will be a culinary delight, you instead find that your yolk is dry and crumbly, or even worse, the egg white is a slimy watery mess.\nThe problem is that the yolk and albumen (the white part of the egg) cook at two different temperatures. Yolk requires a temperature of just 65C (149F) to cook, while the albumen needs a little more heat at 85C (185F).\nConventional methods for cooking eggs, therefore, represent a compromise between those two seemingly incompatible truths. Hard-boil an egg at 100C (212F), and the white will soon become tender and just right. The yolk, however, will be fully set \u2013 which is alright if you like that sort of thing, but disappointing if you're after a soft, runny yolk. Another method of cooking an egg, known as sous vide, involves placing the egg in a water bath at temperatures between 60 and 70C (140-158F) for one hour. This leaves the yolk deliciously runny, but the white can be left slimy and clear.\nHowever, worry not, as researchers have now discovered the perfect method for boiling an egg. What's more, they have shown that the result is not only tastier, but better for you too.\nHow easy is the method to follow?\nI like a runny yolk, so to find out if the periodic method really works, I convinced my husband \u2013 who used to work as a professional chef \u2013 to try it. Although, at first, he was aghast at the idea of boiling an egg for 32 minutes, he diligently performed the instructions as close to the letter as possible. The result, considering the effort he put in, was slightly disappointing. Although the white was pleasingly firm and less watery than that of a soft-boiled egg, the yolk was not runny enough for my taste. It didn\u2019t ooze in the way it ought to. But perhaps one or two minutes less would have made all the difference.\nIn their new paper, researchers led by Pellegrino Musto, a scientist working at Italy's National Research Council in Pozzuoli, first simulated the egg-cooking process using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD is the science of using computers to predict how liquids and gases flow based on the physical laws governing them, such as conservation of mass, momentum and energy.\nThe simulations suggested a new method \u2013 one likely to be entirely unfamiliar to most chefs and amateur cooks \u2013 that might give superior results. The approach, which the authors call periodic cooking, involves alternating between cooking the egg in a pan of boiling water kept at 100C (212F), and placing it into a luke-warm bowl kept at 30C (86F). To get the best results, the egg must be transferred between the two temperatures every two minutes for a total duration of 32 minutes, so it is probably not best suited to home cooks who like to dip in and out of the kitchen leaving their egg unsupervised.\nIf you are willing to put in the effort, however, your rewards will be plentiful. When scientists tried the new method in real life, the resulting egg was exceptional. The researchers confirmed this superiority by analysing the texture, sensory qualities and chemical structure of their perfectly boiled egg using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.\nThe results showed that periodically cooked eggs had a soft yolk similar to that of a sous vide egg \u2013 so far so good. However, unlike eggs cooked sous vide, the white albumen was not runny and uncooked, but instead had a consistency closer to that of a traditionally soft-boiled egg. According to the paper's authors, this is probably because, while temperatures in the periodically cooked egg white ranged between 35C (95F) and 100C (212F) during cooking, the yolk remained at a consistent temperature of 67C (153F) throughout.\nPerhaps most interestingly, chemical analysis revealed that the yolk of periodically cooked eggs contained more polyphenols \u2013 a group of micronutrients mostly found in plants, and touted for their health benefits \u2013 than eggs cooked by other methods. This class of compounds is renowned for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Plants make them as a defence against stressful environmental conditions such as UV radiation, droughts or predation by insects. However, research increasingly shows they can benefit humans too. For example epidemiological studies suggest that high dietary intake of polyphenols is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, specific forms of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.\nEven more reason to try periodically cooked eggs next time you fancy dippy eggs and soldiers for breakfast.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The world's only museum dedicated to the history and culture of the Gulf of Mexico may be in hot water following Trump's decision to change the name of the planet's largest gulf.\nLast year Karen Poth decided it was time to rename the museum she runs in Mobile, Alabama, to better reflect its unique status.\nTo do so, she first had to line up support from elected officials and her board of directors before raising money for the project. Next, she needed to update the museum's website, logo and printed materials. Then in April 2024, she finally unveiled the new name in letters stretching 50ft across the eight-storey building: the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, the only museum in the world dedicated to the history, folklore and culture of the largest gulf on Earth.\nSo, imagine her response when US President Donald Trump recently announced that he planned to rename the body of water to the south of the US from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. \"My personality is to laugh,\" Poth said. \"Or else you cry.\"\nThe name change, which was signed into law on 20 January and is part of a broader Trump effort to \"honour American greatness\", has created an international firestorm. After Google recently announced that it would follow Trump's executive order and also change the Gulf's name on Google Maps in the US, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argued that Trump alone cannot legally do that.\nPoth says she's not taking sides, but admits she's overwhelmed at the thought of what would happen if the museum had to change every reference to the Gulf of America. \"It would be a complete redo of the entire museum. If you think about it, every audio, every video, every digital, every sign\u2026 that will be very, very expensive.\"\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nSince the museum is owned by the city of Mobile, Poth said she will ultimately follow city officials' leads. \"If I need to change the name of the museum, we'll be up there changing the signage on the top of the building.\" The museum still carries debt from its opening a decade ago, and Poth estimates that changing the museum's name in 2024 cost nearly $100,000.\nBut as visitors to the museum learn, the Gulf has actually had many names throughout its multi-cultural history. The name Gulf of Mexico, for example, first appeared on Spanish maps in the mid-1500s as a way of honouring the Mexica people who founded the Aztec empire. Yet, the 218,000-sq-mile oceanic basin \u2013 which borders five US states and a longer stretch of shoreline along the eastern coast of Mexico, along with the north-west coast of Cuba \u2013 has had other names too.\nAccording to John Sledge, the museum's maritime historian in residence, when the Spanish first reached the Gulf in 1513, they thought they had found a route to Asia and initially called it the Chinese Sea (a name unlikely to appeal to Trump, Sledge noted). Other early explorers called it the Gulf of Cort\u00e9s or the Gulf of New Spain.\n\"It was really a Spanish sea throughout the 1500s and the 1600s,\" Sledge said. The Spanish were followed by the French, who founded Mobile and New Orleans in the early 1700s. The British gained control of the eastern edge of the region in the 1760s, before the United States finally seized the area in the 1810s.\nThe massive ship-shaped museum, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, is set on a commanding waterfront location in downtown Mobile's Cooper Riverside Park, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mobile's port and bay, which feeds directly into the Gulf. Interactive displays highlight the area's multi-layered history, as well as its global influence. Visitors learn how the first European settlement in the US wasn't in St Augustine, Florida, as is commonly thought, but some 450 miles west on the Gulf in Pensacola. Exhibits also show how the Gulf's waters have become one of the world's most productive fisheries and one of the US's largest oil-producing regions. In addition, the Gulf Stream, which originates here, influences transatlantic shipping routes and moderates the weather in Western Europe by bringing warm tropical waters north.\nOther popular exhibits include a simulator that lets guests practice piloting ships, models of famous shipwrecks, a multi-storey screen tracking European voyages and towers of shipping containers, which hold exhibits. The city of Mobile, museum curators like to say, changed the world when a local company helped launch the first containerised ships in the 1950s.\nMost people have no idea about the region's complex history, says Jack E Davis, whose 2017 book, The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea, won a Pulitzer Prize. \"They associate it with oil spills and hurricanes.\"\nIn recent weeks, Davis says friends have teased him that his 592-page book might have inspired Trump's executive order to rename the body of water. But Davis says he's not happy with the US's official new name for the Gulf, and when he saw the phrase \"Gulf of America\" used last month in an official pronouncement from Florida's governor, he had a physical response. \"I almost puked, it was just awful. It's so wrong.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only town in the US built for Chinese people\n\u2022 The first free Black town in the US\n\u2022 The first king to travel around the world\nGiven that the Gulf has been central to many cultures over the centuries, Davis claims the new name is just too confining. \"It's not just us,\" he said. \"[The name Gulf of Mexico] takes my mind beyond what we call America, beyond the US to other people to other places.\"\nDavis, who grew up along the Gulf Coast, urges travellers to get to know its museums, historic homes and natural scenery. One of his favourite spots is Padre Island National Seashore in Texas. \"If you go to Padre Island and you don't feel emotionally moved, check your pulse, because it's just really this otherworldly place.\"\nAccording to Davis, the Gulf's first residents arrived 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Early European visitors were astonished when they encountered the Calusa people who thrived along what is now south-west Florida. The tribe harvested the Gulf's abundant seafood, and piled up mounds of oyster shells that stretched for miles. Tribe members were so well-nourished they towered over the Europeans.\nThe next several hundred years saw Spain, France and England competing for influence, said Deanne Stephens,a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi and executive director of the Gulf South Historical Association. \"It was quite an amalgamation of players in the region.\"\u00a0\nSince the 19th Century, the Gulf has attracted immigrants from around the world, ranging from fruit-selling Sicilians in New Orleans to Greek sponge divers in Florida. Along Stephens' Mississippi coast, the seafood industry has attracted workers from places as varied as Poland, Croatia, Vietnam and now Latin America. \"Regardless of who was here, it was always recognised by people as a place of opportunity,\" she said.\u00a0\nLikewise, Poth says her museum consistently surprises visitors. \"They had no idea how important the Gulf of Mexico is to the world.\"\nShe's excited about plans for a new exhibit devoted to another Gulf global influencer: the late singer and Mobile city native Jimmy Buffett, whose hits like Margaritaville introduced many around the world to the coast's laid-back lifestyle. Yet, she admits that the project may bring up a host of issues. \"What are we going to call it? Every one of his songs is about the Gulf of Mexico.\"\nSledge, meanwhile, says if Trump wants to change the Gulf's name, a better choice might be to call it the Gulf of the Americas, which would acknowledge its geographic breadth and its enormous challenges. Scientists say the zone faces many threats in the coming century from pollution, coastal erosion and climate change.\n\"It's a shared resource,\" he said. \"We all depend on it, and it's in our interest to take care of it \u2013 whatever we call it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Dutch linguist Leonie Cornips has become fascinated with how cows communicate. But can this really be called 'language'?\nLeonie Cornips was long overdue for her coffee break. The chilly autumn air made a hot drink feel enticing. But Cornips was busy. She was a couple of hours into her work with a small herd of dairy cows. If she left now, she would lose something that would take time to recover. Cornips and the herd had entered a delicate, shared space she calls \"the rhythm of the cow\".\u00a0\nCornips is a sociolinguist at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The scholars who pass through the institute's ornate doorway usually specialise in the study of Dutch language and culture. The soft-spoken researcher earned her academic laurels in the 1990s, and she still studies variations in syntax between different dialects in the Netherlands. But in addition to this, Cornips' work has more recently taken what professionals in the field call \"the animal turn\".\nFor years, Cornips has spent her summer holidays on a farm. She was struck from the start by the different personalities of individual cows. She read an essay by a philosopher that asked why linguists never study animals. It affected her deeply. Cornips felt that cows had the intelligence and social habits to be good research subjects for a linguist. As a Dutch person, she also knew they were cultural icons in a nation with a passion for cheese. So she turned her professional skills to cows.\nHumans have assumed for centuries that the ability to use language is a measure of our superiority. There is even an academic term for it: \"logocentrism\", meaning those who use words (from the Greek logos, meaning \"word\" or \"reason\") occupy a privileged position. Language, say many linguists, is what makes us human. Animals may grunt, bark or chirp, but they do not possess anything that counts as language.\nCornips is using her work with dairy cows to push back on this idea. It extends half a century of effort that began with Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees and Roger Payne's recording of humpback whales in the 1960s in an effort to show that humans may not be as linguistically unique as we had assumed.\nMany of Cornips' colleagues were sceptical when she suggested they apply the framework of linguistics to animals.\n\"The problem is people have no clear idea about language,\" she says. \"When they talk about language, they always refer to what comes out of the mouth.\" But after spending six years thoroughly immersed in the lives of cows, Cornips thinks that language is better understood as \"distributed\" between the mouth, body and surroundings, making it embodied, multi-modal and sensory. \"I'm eating with the cows, touching, kissing, walking, hugging,\" she says.\nMost research on cow language tend to focus on sounds. A 2015 study in the Netherlands, for example, looked at the pitch of cow sounds to see if they correlated with behaviours and concluded this could be a way to determine their welfare. And a 2019 Australian study found cows not only have distinctive individual vocalisations, but maintain these distinctive calls across a variety of contexts.\nCornips and the farmers she recruits to assist her record the frequency, duration and intensity of the sounds cows make. But she also focusses on the other ways meaning is expressed among bovines. Her methods are often ethnographic, a way of studying cultures that relies strongly on observation by the researcher. Cornips carefully observes cow behaviours and interactions alongside sound to determine how they communicate. \"I notice with cows that the body is an instrument to get to know the other,\" she says. Recognising this leads Cornips to talk less of \"language\" and more widely of \"languaging practices\".\nCows, for example, have an elaborate greeting ritual that Cornips must follow to successfully slip into the rhythm of the herd, she says. This became obvious with Piet, a young male Fleckvieh from an intensively managed indoor facility who Cornips brought to join five other cows in an outdoor pasture.\u00a0\n\"I was always so happy to see him, that when I got into his meadow, I walked straight towards him and tried to touch him immediately,\" Cornips says. When she did so, Piet would back away.\nCornips gradually came to understand the need to respect Piet's personal space, as she might with a fellow human. She learned to keep her arms by her sides and only use eye contact intermittently, taking turns with Piet to look at each other and then look away. \"It took me quite a while,\" she says. \"I was very stupid. They are teaching me how to connect to them.\" Cornips realised she had to learn an etiquette. Without patience and attention, she says, you would never see it.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The scientists learning to speak whale\n\u2022\u00a0The sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet' revealed by AI\n\u2022\u00a0Is there something special about the human voice?\nPatience also turns out to be crucial when cows communicate with each other. When a mother calls her calf, it sometimes takes 60 seconds for the calf to respond. The space between is filled with bodily gestures. Studies from Austria show that ear positioning and neck-stretching are integral to cow language. Humans think of the ability to wiggle our ears as a party trick. For a cow, it appears to be fundamental to communication. The first sentence in a conversation with a cow is likely to involve movement of the ears and a look.\u00a0\u00a0\nCows are not the only animals being studied for their complex modes of communication. Michelle Fournet, an assistant professor specialising in marine acoustic ecology at the University of New Hampshire in the US, has learned it is unhelpful to impose human expectations on species like whales and seals.\nAnimals use sound completely differently from how humans use it, she says. \"If we are to do a good job at understanding how animals are communicating and why they are communicating, it behoves us to adopt their perspective.\"\nFournet stops short of using the word \"language\" to describe the information transfer taking place between non-humans. But she has gained a deep appreciation for the subtleties of animal communication. Their system is not less than ours, Fournet says, but other. We do them a disservice by searching for similarities.\u00a0\nOne difference between humans and many animals is their use of the environment. Cornips has found cow communication leans on its surroundings more than ours. She observed one herd where individuals used their bodies to bang on an iron fence to communicate with the rest of the herd at feeding time, which she views as a type of language. She noticed cows responding to her differently depending on whether she entered a barn with solid walls or open sides: since cows on different farms are surrounded by different physical features, this offers distinctive opportunities for linguistic expression. Cows, she argues, develop diverse languaging practices \u2013 almost like dialects \u2013 where meaning depends on the shape of their surroundings.\nLike other domestic animals, cows face the additional challenge of interspecies communication with humans. \"Most farmers are not sensitive to the rhythm of the cow,\" says Cornips. \"The cows must obey the rhythm of the farmer.\" Dairy herds are constantly shunted between feeding, milking and grazing grounds. If a cow does not learn the daily routine or fails to be productive, it goes to the slaughterhouse. She is shocked by how readily people assume cows are stupid.\u00a0\n\"In becoming a dairy cow,\" she says, \"they must have very rich communicative skills because they have to understand what the farmer wants them to do\u2026 which is not easy.\"\nCornips has analysed recordings to show that cows will simplify their vocalisation once a farmer recognises their need. Rather than having their intelligence bred out of them to be more compliant, Cornips thinks domestic animals are forced to develop a fuller communication repertoire than wild animals.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf dairy cows have complex linguistic practices, it's tempting to ask how they stack up against the other great communicators in the animal kingdom. How would they compare, for example, to humpback whales? Cornips admires the complex vocalisations found in whale song. Humpbacks are among the cetaceans known to develop different dialects in different regions. They also communicate over vast distances. (Read more about the sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language which researchers are uncovering in whale communication).\nBut Cornips points out that whales lack some of the capacities of cows. A whale's ears are not as moveable as a cow's, she says. They also lack hooves. \"Whales cannot express themselves bodily very much,\" Cornips says. \"In that way they may be [less complex] than cows.\"\nFournet says she does not believe it makes sense to rank animal communication by its complexity. \"There isn't an answer to what you are looking for,\" she told me when I asked her to compare whales to cows.\nMany traditional linguists are still hesitant to ascribe language to non-humans. Leora Bar-el, a linguistics professor at the University of Montana in the US, is not hostile to the idea of animal language but thinks it worth asking what we gain and what we lose by expanding the definition of language to include cows.\n\"We may lose the fact there is something unique about human language,\" she says. For example, human language permits incredible creativity. Think of the works of Shakespeare. It can also refer to distant events and even reflect back on itself, as language does when it provides a definition.\nBut Eva Meijer, author of the essay that first inspired Cornips and the 2018 book Animal Languages, argues such claims can be self-fulfilling. \"What we see as language has been developed by excluding the language of other animals,\" she says. In fact, we define language in a way that makes it easy to deny it to others. Meijer points out the long history of human oppression associated with denying other people their language. She believes that recognising language in animals provides new tools for understanding them and perhaps even for learning how to inhabit the planet more sustainably.\nCornips, though, does not put an animal rights agenda at the centre of her work. She is focused primarily on expanding the field of linguistics. But the implications are hard to ignore. Cows may have more complex social lives than we thought. Her research reveals numerous additional avenues for exploration. How much does language contribute to distinctive bovine communities and cultures? What sort of planning can cows do with each other? Can they use language to pass on knowledge between generations?\nThe answers to these questions could change how we regard the lives of many animals. When 96% of the weight of mammals on earth is made up of humans and domesticated livestock, understanding better what cattle, sheep and chickens are communicating could lead to improved relationships with them, as well as better lives for animals.\u00a0\nCornips knows things are unlikely to change fast. Recently, though, she has noticed the idea that animals have language has become more common in academic journals.\nShe hopes linguistics can be a tool for unlocking different attitudes. \"My most important goal,\" she says, \"is to show others that you can look with different eyes at a domestic animal.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Vladimir Syromiatnikov's bold attempts to light up Siberia with a space mirror captured global attention. The BBC's Tomorrow's World reported on an ambitious experiment that was launched on 4 February 1993.\nIt sounds like a scheme a James Bond villain might hatch: launching a giant mirror into orbit to harness the Sun's rays, then redirecting them to beam down on a target on Earth. Yet this was exactly what the Russian space agency Roscosmos attempted to do on 4 February 1993.\nBut the aim of the Znamya (meaning banner in Russian) project was not a dastardly plot to hold the world to ransom. Its more utopian goal, as presenter Kate Bellingham explained on BBC Tomorrow's World before Znamya's launch, was \"to light up Arctic cities in Siberia during the dark winter months\". Essentially, it would try to switch the Sun back on again for Russia's polar regions after night fell.\nEven today this seems a novel concept, yet the idea of using mirrors in space to reflect light onto the Earth's surface was not actually a new one. Back in 1923, German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth had proposed it in The Rocket into Planetary Space. His self-published book \u2013 based on a PhD thesis which Heidelberg University had rejected for seeming too implausible \u2013 demonstrated mathematically how a rocket could leave the Earth's orbit. Among the other ideas covered in the publication were the potential effects on the human body of space travel, how satellites could be launched into orbit, and, crucially, the concept of creating a grid of colossal adjustable concave mirrors that could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the Earth. Oberth reasoned that this illumination could help avert disasters \u2013 like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 \u2013 or assist with the rescue of their survivors. Oberth also speculated that space mirrors could be used to clear shipping lanes by melting icebergs or even to manipulate the Earth's weather patterns.\u00a0\nThis space mirror idea was taken up again by German physicists during World War Two. At the Nazi weapons research centre in Hillersleben, scientists worked on a design to build a terrifying reflective orbiting weapon called the Sonnengewehr or Sun gun in German. In 1945, Time magazine reported that captured German scientists had told US Army interrogators that the Sonnengewehr was meant to act as a death ray, refocusing light from the Sun to set fire to cities or boil away water in lakes. Despite facing evident scepticism from their US interrogators as they handed over their technical drawings, the German scientists had believed that their Sun gun could be operational in 50 years, the chief of Allied technical intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel John Keck, told reporters at the time.\nIn the 1970s, another German\u2010born rocket engineer, Dr Krafft Ehricke, again began looking at the concept. Ehricke had been a member of Germany's V-2 rocket team during World War Two. At the end of the war, he surrendered to the US and was recruited as part of Operation Paperclip, wherein 1,600 scientists, engineers and technicians deemed to be valuable were shielded from prosecution, spirited out of Germany, and allowed to continue their work in the US.\nEhricke became part of the US space programme, and in the 1970s he returned to the idea of building a mirror in space. In 1978, he wrote a paper detailing how giant orbiting mirrors could illuminate the night sky, enabling farmers to plant or harvest 24 hours a day, or could be used to deflect sunlight down onto solar panels on Earth to be converted into electricity on demand. He called this idea Power Soletta. Ehricke, a space-travel enthusiast from childhood and a long-time proponent of colonising other planets, died in 1984 without seeing Power Soletta come to fruition. But he would get his long-desired space flight posthumously when his cremated remains were launched into Earth's orbit in 1997 along with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s counterculture psychologist Timothy Leary.\u00a0\nThroughout the 1980s, Nasa looked repeatedly at the concept of generating solar power by harnessing sunlight with an orbiting mirror system called Solares, but despite government interest the project was never able to secure funding. However, in Russia the idea of solar mirrors took root.\u00a0\nAt the time, a Russian scientist called Vladimir Syromiatnikov was investigating whether large reflective solar sails could be attached to a spaceship. Syromiatnikov was a pioneering figure in space engineering breakthroughs. He had worked on the Vostok rocket, the world's first crewed spacecraft that took Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. He also developed an ingenious spacecraft docking mechanism, the Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS). This was used in July 1975 in the Apollo-Soyuz test project, the first joint space flight by the then Cold War enemies, the US and the USSR, in which a US module carrying three astronauts successfully linked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule carrying two cosmonauts in orbit. His APAS was later used to enable US shuttles to dock with the Russian Mir space station and is still used for docking at the International Space Station.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov thought that if solar sails were attached to a spacecraft they could use the Sun in a similar fashion to how ships' sails use the wind. If the reflective sails could be angled correctly then photons, particles of energy coming from the Sun, could bounce off their mirror-like surfaces and gently propel the craft forward through space without it having to burn any fuel.\nHowever, in Russia during the post-Soviet era, getting funding for ambitious space projects like Syromiatnikov's was difficult unless they could demonstrate a clear economic goal. So Syromiatnikov decided to repurpose his concept. He thought that reflective solar sails on a spacecraft in orbit could act as a mirror, with the craft's thrusters used to angle the sails and keep them in sync with the Sun's position. That mirror could be used to beam down light on Russia's polar regions where the days are extremely short in the winter, illuminating areas shrouded in darkness. The extra sunlight would extend the working day and increase the productivity of farmlands. He also envisioned that the bonus sunshine could reduce the cost of electrical lighting and heating for the area and add to the wellbeing of people in the region.\nThis turned out to be an idea that the government could get behind. And so, funded by the Space Regatta Consortium, a group of Russian state-owned companies and agencies, and overseen by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Syromiatnikov began work on making the Znamya space mirror a reality.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nThe first prototype built, Znamya 1, wasn't actually sent into space, but remained on Earth to be tested so that Syromiatnikov could iron out any technical problems. Znamya 2 was to be the first to go into orbit. Its mirror was made from thin sheets of aluminised Mylar, a lightweight highly reflective material which was thought to be sturdy enough to survive the hostile conditions in space. It was designed to unfurl in eight sections into a circular shape from a rotating central drum mechanism and stay in that form through centrifugal force.\u00a0\n\"During the flight the reflector is wrapped tightly around the body of the craft, and to open it the craft will have to spin round rapidly forcing it out like an umbrella,\" explained the BBC's Bellingham to TV viewers in 1992. \"The trick is that at this height the 20m-wide reflector will then be able to capture the Sun's rays which normally bypass the Earth and reflect them down onto the dark side of our planet.\"\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov's plan was to have multiple Znamya launches, each one with a larger mirror that burned up as it came back to Earth. Russian engineers would be able to study how Znamya's thin reflective sheets performed when they were activated in space, and perfect his design. This would lead to the launch of a permanent Znamya with a massive 200m-wide reflector that would stay in orbit around Earth.\nThe ultimate ambition was to have a grid of up to 36 of these giant mirrors in space with the ability to pivot, enabling them to keep the reflected light targeted on the same spot. A single reflector could be used to light up a peculiar area. \"On a clear night the space reflector could illuminate an area the size of a football stadium, bringing some light relief to the long winter nights,\" said Bellingham. Or multiple reflectors could focus light together to bring greater brightness or illuminate a bigger region. It was estimated that the combined space mirror grid would be able to reflect light 50 times brighter than the Moon and illuminate an area up to 50 miles (90km) across.\u00a0\nOn 27 October 1992, the project was ready, and the crewless spacecraft Progress M-15 launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Znamya 2 on board. After the cargo supply craft docked with the Russian space station, Mir's crew fitted the drum containing the folded reflective solar sheets into position on the Progress spacecraft. Znamya 2 was due to be trialled towards the end of the year, but its deployment was delayed while the Mir crew conducted tests for other upcoming missions. On 4 February 1993, they were finally ready to put the plan into action.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Training for the Apollo 11 Moon mission\n\u2022\u00a0Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\n\u2022\u00a0The 'alien invasion' that scared the US\nThe autonomous Progress spacecraft undocked, and once it was at a distance of some 150m from Mir, it began to rotate, unfurling the mirror like a giant fan which caught the Sun's rays and beamed them back down to Earth.\nThe reflected light had a luminosity roughly equivalent to a full moon and created a spotlight about three miles (5km) wide on Earth. At a speed of five miles per second (8km per second) the patch of light raced from southern France through Switzerland, Germany, and Poland across to western Russia. The crew on Mir were able to see a faint beam of light as it swept through Europe, and despite much of the continent being covered in clouds that day, some people on the ground reported witnessing it as a flash of light. After a few hours, the space mirror deorbited and burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere over Canada.\u00a0\nBack in Russia, the Znamya 2 experiment was hailed as a technical success \u2013 but it also demonstrated some significant challenges for the project. Znamya 2's reflected light had proved much less intense than expected and too diffused to provide practical illumination for a large area on Earth. It had also been tricky maintaining Znamya 2's stability in orbital conditions, and its spotlight's rapid journey across the Earth's surface and fleeting visibility made its real-world uses seem limited.\nBut the mission had provided encouraging results and valuable insights, so Syromiatnikov ploughed ahead with his planned follow-up experiment, Znamya 2.5. This time it would have a 25m mirror, reflecting a luminosity of between five and 10 full moons, and shining a spot of light that would cover an area five miles (8km) wide. The intention was to control the direction of the reflected light beam so it could target a spot on the Earth for several minutes at a time as Znamya 2.5 revolved around the Earth. Two cities in North America were picked to be illuminated by the mirror's sun ray during what would be a 24-hour experiment, as well as several in Europe.\u00a0\nSyromiatnikov was heartened by the progress his team was making, and the launch was planned for October 1998. \"We are pioneers in the field,\" he told The Moscow Times in July 1998. \"If the experiment goes according to plan, we propose to send dozens more craft into space in the future on a permanent basis.\"\nBut even before Znamya 2.5 left the ground, Russian space officials began receiving complaints. Astronomers were worried that the mirror would pollute the night sky with light, dazzling their telescopes and obscure their view of the stars. The Royal Astronomical Society went so far as to protest to the Director General of the Space Regatta Consortium about the experiment. Ecologists also raised concerns that its artificial light might cause confusion to animals and plants, disrupting wildlife and nature cycles.\u00a0\nDespite these misgivings, there was considerable global attention and excitement about the Znamya project's potential implications. \"Think what it will mean for the future of mankind,\" Syromiatnikov told The Moscow Times. \"No more electricity bills, no more long, dark winters. This is a serious breakthrough for technology.\" And so, the Znamya 2.5's launch went ahead as planned, and with Mission Control monitoring from Moscow, the larger space mirror was primed to deploy on 5 February 1999.\nAt first everything went as planned; the folded-up space mirror had been attached to Progress, which undocked from Mir without a hitch. It smoothly moved into position away from the space station, Progress's thrusters were commanded to fire, and it began to spin to unfurl the foil mirror. Unfortunately, at the same time an extra command was sent to Progress by mistake, telling it to deploy the antenna it used to communicate for docking manoeuvres. As the antenna extended, Znamya 2.5's thin reflective sheets immediately became caught up in it.\nMission Control in Moscow watched in dismay as footage of the tangled mirror beamed back from Mir, and frantic commands were sent to retract the antenna. But by this time, several yards of foil had already become wrapped around it, tearing the mirror in several places. Realising that they were in danger of ripping the reflective sheets further, the commands were paused. A second desperate attempt to spin the mirror free was tried an hour later, but to no avail.\nCrestfallen, Mission Control recognised that the Znamya 2.5's torn and crumpled mirror could never be unfurled, and allowed it to fall to Earth still attached to the Progress craft. It burnt up in the atmosphere the following day over the Pacific Ocean. \"The mood here is very depressed,\" Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for the Mission Control in Moscow, told the BBC at the time.\u00a0\nIts fall to Earth did not just destroy Znamya 2.5 but the future of Syromiatnikov's idealistic space mirror project. His planned Znamya 3 with a 70m reflecting surface, which was meant to launch in 2001, could not secure funding and was never built. Syromiatnikov, widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding space engineers of his generation, died in 2006, his dreams of solar sails and mirrors unrealised.\u00a0\n\"The failure was especially painful because of the huge worldwide interest that the experiment aroused,\" Lyndin told the BBC in 1999. \"We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programmes \u2013 to do something first and boast about it only after.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Sir Alex Ferguson, an illustrious predecessor, may well have approved.\n\"If the coach has no control, he will not last,\" Ferguson explained in a case study for Harvard Business School, published in the weeks after his retirement in 2013.\n\"You have to achieve a position of comprehensive control. Players must recognise that as the manager, you have the status to control events. Before I came to United, I told myself I wasn't going to allow anyone to be stronger than I was. Your personality has to be bigger than theirs.\"\nAmorim's latest comments on the Rashford saga were not as polished but the sentiment was the same.\n\"You [the media] want to make it personal,\" said Amorim. \"I have nothing against Marcus but I have to make the same rules for everybody.\"\nIt was more or less the same message Amorim delivered at the Etihad Stadium in dropping Rashford and forward Alejandro Garnacho for the Manchester derby win over City.\nIn various forms, it has been repeated at least half a dozen times in the interim.\n\"It's important, the performance in training, the performance in the games, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with your team-mates, the way you push your team-mates, everything is important in the context of beginning something, when we want to change a lot of things,\" Amorim outlined. \n\"It's the small details. When people in our club are losing their jobs, we have to put the standards really high.\"\nRashford scored three times in Amorim's first two league games, but hadn't been on the field for the last 12 matches\nRashford responded to that forceful assertion by using a visit to his old school to tell football writer Henry Winter he was ready for \"a new challenge\".\nThat was widely interpreted to mean the player wanted to leave. But sources close to Rashford explained that, as they understood it, he was voicing a general feeling of frustration rather than a desire to try something new.\nThey say he felt he was being eased out of a club he remained attached to - a club he felt he knew far better than those running it.\nClub sources say Rashford has trained well. Unlike Jadon Sancho, who fell out with former United boss Erik ten Hag, again over standards, Rashford was not banished to a different area of the Carrington training ground and told to change on his own.\nWhile Rashford's body language has not always presented the most positive image, recent open training showed a different side.\nDuring the 15-minute sessions broadcast before the Europa League matches against Rangers and FCSB, Rashford was expressive and light-hearted.\nWhen Amorim 'ran the gauntlet' through the first-team squad to mark his 40th birthday, Rashford was among those in the line, smiling after the United boss had charged through.\nThis video can not be played\nMarcus Rashford's best Premier League goals\nIt has never been plain sailing for Rashford at United.\nA succession of managers have felt at times they were not getting the most out of a player with blinding speed, excellent balance and an eye for goal.\nFor the 2022-23 season, the first under Ten Hag, Rashford was diligent, going to the United States for personal sessions to ensure he was ready to go when the real preparations began.\nThe reward was a career-high 30 goals. It is a strike rate no-one else in the United squad can match and is the chief reason why representatives spent time visiting some of European football's biggest clubs - Barcelona, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund - gauging interest and trying to work out what kind of a deal was possible before the transfer window closed.\nBut was the goals output confirmation of Rashford's talent or the exception amid more mediocre returns in recent times?\nThe season before, he found the net twice in his final 28 appearances. Since August 2023, he has scored 15 in total. The drop-off is alarming. Even sources close to the 27-year-old accept he is not playing well.\nHowever, despite missing the past 11 games, he is still United's joint-fourth highest scorer this season with seven, the same as \u00a372m signing Hojlund, who has played four more games.\nOnly Amad Diallo (six), Bruno Fernandes (five) and Hojlund (four) have scored more goals under Amorim than Rashford (three), who has only been on the pitch in 35% of the new head coach's games at United.\nUnited's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney has told Rashford in private he should leave. It is an observation he offered to a wider audience on The Overlap podcast.\n\"I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times,\" he said. \"I've given him my thoughts. I've said: You need to leave the football club.\n\"I went into Carrington to take my kids to game day and Marcus was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games. I remember looking at him thinking: How embarrassing is it that the parents are walking past?\"\nRooney's former United team-mate Rio Ferdinand used similar terms to describe how he would feel if a manager had called out his training performances as Amorim had to Rashford.\n\"My heart, my pride, my ego. It's embarrassment,\" Ferdinand said.\n\"For someone to question you giving 100% for the team, saying you're lacking effort and taking shortcuts: That's a damning comment. There's no way back for Marcus after that.\"\nThe mural on the side of a cafe in Withington, south Manchester, was created by a street artist in tribute after Rashford's campaign to extend free school meals during the coronavirus pandemic\nOne theory floated by a source with an understanding of the workings at Old Trafford pointed to financial matters.\nRashford and Casemiro - who has not been omitted from Amorim's squad like the England man but has played only three times since the Plzen game - are by far United's highest earners. The theory is their presence makes it difficult for United to get their profligacy in the transfer market under control.\nIf they left, representatives of prospective signings would be unable to use them as a benchmark for wage negotiations.\nConsequently, it is not until those salaries are off the books that United can properly start to move forward in a more sustainable manner, without the threat of profit and sustainability breaches hanging over them. Those rules also feed the view that homegrown stars such as Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo might need to be sold.\nUnited have grown used to subsidising moves for highly paid players who are not reaching the standards required and no longer wanted by the manager of the day. Their wage bill is one of the highest in world football. Few would say United have been getting value for money.\nAlexis Sanchez, Donny van de Beek, Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Sancho have all fallen into that bracket.\nRashford is the next one out, with United believing they have done well to negotiate a deal that, they say, covers 75% of his wages.\nSources close to the player were adamant the interest in him was huge.\nThere were offers from the Saudi Pro-League, but he felt accepting might mean abandoning his England career.\nA big ambition was to join Barcelona, but they needed to offload players to make it happen. That scenario never materialised into anything close to reality.\nSo Villa, emboldened financially by the \u00a371m sale of Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr, made their pitch.\nThere is plenty about the switch that makes sense. Villa's status is currently greater than that of United. They are pushing for a top-five slot, despite Saturday's defeat at Wolves, and have a Champions League last-16 game in March to look forward to. Unai Emery needs someone who can play through the centre, if required, or in a wide slot. Although he prefers to be on the left, Rashford can do all of this.\nEmery, it is being stressed, was a huge selling point. On a personal level, Rashford doesn't need to move house. \nSo the lifelong Manchester United fan, who felt so entwined with his team, will now wear the claret and blue of Villa, at least until the end of the season. \nAs for Amorim, he has made the big call. He no longer has to answer questions about a player who belongs to another club.\nBut he needs to deliver success himself. If he doesn't, and Rashford does well, he will be in a very uncomfortable position.",

        "article_text": "This ancient snack is synonymous with Tibetan New Year and will soon be prepared by millions of families.\nAt the entrance of the Kemgun Gumba monastery in Lukla, Nepal, an indigo-blue sign reads \"dining\". Inside, nearly a dozen women and a few men are hard at work, hunched over long tables, deftly mixing, rolling and slicing dough into thin rectangular strips. Each strip is slit in the middle, and one side of the dough is pulled into a ribbon-like bow. The rhythmic pounding of dough punctuates the crackle of oil sizzling in a large vessel outside, as boys and girls transform the doughy strips into deep-fried khapse (kha zas\u00a0in Tibetan), a sweet, crunchy snack central to Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists.\n\"Kha means 'mouth', and sey means 'snack',\" said chef Yeshi Jampa, co-author of the book Taste Tibet and founder of the eponymous Taste Tibet restaurant in Oxford. \"It's a symbol of [Tibetan] New Year,\" or Losar, he added.\nEvery year, millions of Tibetan and Sherpa Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, India and elsewhere celebrate Losar (lo\u00a0means \"year\" and\u00a0gsar means \"new\"). The 15-day festival (which starts 28 February 2025) occurs on the first day of the Tibetan Lunar calendar and celebrates renewal and new beginnings. The first three days of the festival are considered the most important when followers visit monasteries, offer ceremonial scarves, receive blessings from Rinpoches (respected Tibetan teachers or lamas) and prepare special dishes with friends and family \u2013 especially khapse.\nEating khapse on Losar is thought to bring warmth, peace and tranquillity in the new year, and preparing it is both an art and a labour-intensive process. The dough (made of wheat flour, butter, sugar and oil with an optional egg) is kneaded, rolled and shaped into designs like flowers, knots and braids before being and fried in ghee (clarified butter).\nAccording to Geshema Delek Dolma, a nun at Dolma Ling Nunnery in northern India's Himachal Pradesh state, the history of khapse is intertwined with early Bon rituals \u2013 the indigenous religion practised across the Tibetan plateau before the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th Century CE \u2013 where blood offerings were made to deities.\n\"[Instead] of animal sacrifice, the custom evolved into offering khapse, which was sometimes coloured red as a symbolic gesture,\" Dolma said. \"The practice eventually spread to the other two provinces [Amdo and Kham] of\u00a0Tibet.\"\nKhapse-making is a communal activity.Itrequires many hands to prepare the honey-golden pastries in large quantities so it can be distributed to friends, family and across the community. So in the days ahead of Losar, family members come together to prepare large batches of khapse.\n\"It depends on how much quantity [of khapse] you have to make,\" said Kanchhi Maya Sherpa, who runs the Hotel Sherwi Hyul in Kathmandu. \"It's impossible for one [or] two people to make it as we need to knead the mixture together for a long time. Working together in the Gumba [monastery] is community work.\"\nFollowers first offer khapse to the deities as part of their religious practice, and afterwards, the crunchy treat is shared with others, including the poor, as a means of charity. \"This is always the tradition because Tibetans believe in the service of others before self,\" said Jampa.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Chhurpi: The world's hardest cheese?\n\u2022 The world's higest train line\n\u2022 After 100 hours in Tibet, I knew it was time to leave\nAs Jamyang Norbu, author of the book Echoes From Forgotten Mountains, notes on his blog, the first piece of khapse isn't actually eaten or offered. Instead, it's customary to shape the dough in a scorpion-shaped cookie, fry it and then place it outside the kitchen until \"the 15th day of the New Year to ward off bad luck and possible accidents that could take place during the [khapse]-making\".\n\"Traditionally, it was believed that making khapse could predict success for the upcoming year,\" explained Dolma. For example, oil spilling during the frying process was considered a bad omen. Jampa recalled an accident from his childhood that ruined his family's New Year celebrations. \"[It meant] evil,\" he said, noting how preparing the snack is steeped in cultural beliefs.\nKhapse recipes and the shapes the snack takes vary across regions and families. In Tibet's Markam County, where Jampa grew up, khapse was traditionally sweetened with organic honey from their beehives instead of sugar. Khapse made with honey \"makes the biscuit a little softer\", he explained. \"The sweetness of honey-made khapse arrives more slowly.\" In contrast, recipes that call for sugar have a crunchier texture.\n\"Different parts of Tibet mould khapse differently [and] in different shapes,\" Jampa said. \"I am from Kham. In my village, we make less ornate\u00a0khapse, known as\u00a0kong-chen \u2013 a narrow rectangular piece of dough with a cut in the middle through which one side of the\u00a0khapse\u00a0is pulled through.\" Another style, the hrug-hrug, \"are basically just small rectangles or triangles of dough that require no further work\", Jampa explained.\nKhapse is also deeply connected to Buddhist rituals. During Losar, flowers, fruits, grains, nuts, salt, butter and water are placed on the altar, as offerings to deities, alongside stacks of khapse arranged in towers called derga.\n\"Derga khapses are different shapes, compared to the khapses that we eat,\" my Tibetan friend, Tenzin Diki, told me. \"We add khapse in the shape of a crescent moon and a sun on the derga. We also add beautiful kharu (smaller, ornately designed pieces of khapse) on the derga, and decorate it with chhurpi [traditional cheese], sweets [and] rock sugar.\"\nToday, these fried cookies have evolved in style and shape and are eaten throughout the year. Khapse is sold year-round at stores in Kathmandu and many families prepare it as a snack outside of Losar. A quick online search for \"khapse\" or \"khapsey\" shows legions of home chefs and food bloggers experimenting with moulding the cookies and preparing them with additional ingredients like banana, beetroot, spinach and more.\n\"These days, people have modernised khapse, using their creativity, adding motifs to shape it differently,\" Sherpa explained. \"The shapes now depend on how much creativity one has. You can make it in any shape you want.\"\nYet, not everyone embraces these innovations. \"We have to keep traditional things traditional,\" said Jampa. \"[Khapse] is a special ceremony snack, a symbol of family effort and [it] reminds us that it is something special.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Winter isn't all bad \u2013 these \"sublime\" landscapes of the frozen North from the turn of the 20th Century offer us a way into resilience \u2013 and an \"acceptance of the seasonality of life\".\nWith its bare trees, long nights and icy temperatures, it's perhaps unsurprising that, culturally in the Northern Hemisphere, we seem so conditioned to complain about winter. Yet, as the author Katherine May points out in her 2020 book Wintering, winter is also a valuable time for rest and retreat. \"Winter offers us liminal spaces to inhabit,\" she writes. Its \"starkness\", she argues, re-sensitises us, and \"can reveal colours that we would otherwise miss\".\nFor Nordic countries, where, in some regions, the season can last more than six months, making peace with winter is a necessity, with concepts such as the Norwegian friluftsliv\u00a0(embracing the natural world) and the Danish hygge (hunkering down with simple comforts) offering fresh perspectives on cold weather.\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, the frozen North \u2013 with its vast fjords, mystical boreal forests and radiant light \u2013 became a powerful muse for artists such as Hilma af Klint, Edvard Munch and Harald Sohlberg. These artists immersed themselves in these cold climates, and developed a specifically Nordic style of painting imbued with their emotional responses to the landscape. Around 70 of these intensely atmospheric, expressionist works by artists from Scandinavia, Finland and Canada are being showcased in a new exhibition, Northern Lights, a cross-Atlantic collaboration that debuts at the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, before travelling to New York's Buffalo AKG Art Museum in August.\nIt was natural that these painters should be drawn to these wintery scenes, Ulf K\u00fcster, the exhibition's curator, tells the BBC. \"In Nordic landscapes, snow is a very dominant factor of life from October to late April\u2026 It's just this massive presence of white and nature and wilderness and vastness that really defines this landscape, and I think these painters have found a very interesting response to that.\" This burst of Nordic landscape painting was also a response to the changes that the painters perceived as a result of population growth and industrialisation. \"There was a big desire in the late 19th Century to return to pure nature and the simple life,\" explains K\u00fcster. \"You had these highly industrialised countries and pollution, and the pureness of white snow must have been quite a contrast.\" \u00a0\nMany of these northern regions were comparatively untouched by change, and featured vast, unpopulated vistas that were inherently painterly. Even today, Norway has a population of just 5.5 million, but a length of around 1,600km; while around three-quarters of Finland is still forested. To convey this scale, these paintings often adopt unconventional compositions where the view appears to stretch beyond the canvas. They are \"boundless\", says K\u00fcster. \"They don't have borders\". This is reinforced by the bird's-eye view adopted in works such as View from Pyynikki Ridge (1900) by the Finnish artist Helmi Biese. \"It's as if the artists have used a drone,\" remarks K\u00fcster.\nThe height and scope of these unpopulated views also convey a sense of isolation and loneliness. Harald Sohlberg, whose luminescent 1914 version of Winter Night in the Mountains is widely considered to be the national painting of Norway, wrote: \"The longer I stood gazing at the scene, the more I seemed to feel what a solitary and pitiful atom I was in an endless universe\u2026 It was as if I had suddenly awakened in a new, unimagined and inexplicable world\u2026 Above the white contours of a northern winter stretched the endless vault of heaven, twinkling with myriads of stars. It was like a service in some vast cathedral.\"\u00a0\nIt was this search for solitude that doubtless drew the Swedish artist Anna Boberg to the Norwegian archipelago of Lofoten, a remote location steeped in Viking folklore and, according to her 1901 memoir, \"the apotheosis of Arctic beauty and wilderness\". It was here, dressed head-to-toe in seal and reindeer fur, that she produced her Northern Lights (1901) painting, most likely sketched en plein air. In a commanding scene that speaks to the Romantic notion of \"the sublime\", prismatic streaks of light descend from the heavens dwarfing the snowy landscape.\nBoberg's awe when confronted with this dazzling wintry world with its unique light is clear. \"What really drove these people was to find a response to the extremities of nature \u2013 the very essence of snow, winter and ice.\" explains K\u00fcster. To achieve this, they would \"get as close to nature as possible\", he says. Far from hiding from the harsh winter, Boberg and her contemporaries immersed themselves in the landscape. \"They are painters who really wanted to paint the experience, to feel the extreme temperature and the snow blindness,\" says K\u00fcster. Munch, he continues, had outdoor studios, and would leave his paintings outside \"just to let nature test them\", while some of the Canadian painters would paddle out on to lakes and paint from their canoes. \u00a0\nInland, the boreal forest embodied the enchanting duality of these landscapes, which were both beautiful and barbaric. The dark, primeval forests became an emblem of foreboding in Nordic folklore and myth \u2013 places where you could get lost, and that concealed unknown dangers. The Nordic winter landscape fed the fairytales of the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. \"Below them the wind blew cold, wolves howled, and black crows screamed as they skimmed across the glittering snow,\" he writes in The Snow Queen (1844). \"But up above, the moon shone bright and large.\"\nThis storybook quality can be seen in Winter Moonlight (1895) by the Swedish painter Gustaf Fjaestad. Here, his clever use of pointillism makes the snow appear to glitter, while the hand-like branches of the dense, drooping trees look poised to come alive. In The Lair of the Lynx (1908), Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a Finn, also revels in this tantalising, darker side to the landscape, inviting us to scan the canvas for the dark places beasts may be lurking, and to follow their tracks in the snow.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eight nature books to change your life\n\u2022\u00a0The climate warnings in 19th-Century paintings\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nNotable, also, is the power and movement he gives to the snow as it winds in thick layers around the trees. \"The brushwork of this painting meticulously reacts to the layers of snow,\" says K\u00fcster. \"It's snowing, then it's freezing, there might be some sun and there's a little thaw, and then there's freezing again and more snow comes on top.\" The painter is clearly entranced by the snow, the layers of paint telling the snow's story. The visual effect, observes K\u00fcster, is \"like a sort of wedding cake\".\nAs well as drawing inspiration from the landscape's mythical associations, these artists participated in their own myth-making, expressing \u2013 through their own strong emotional responses to these unspoilt regions \u2013 an often idealised view of the Nordic winter. Some, such as Edvard Munch, nevertheless hinted at the changes threatening these serene expanses. During the winter of 1900, he stayed in Nordstrand on the banks of the Oslofjord. Here he painted his now-famous rendition of its serene waters reflecting a magnificent sky of pink, blue and yellow. But this picturesque, swirling scene, foregrounded by pines, is interrupted by a bulbous trail of white paint, denoting, not snow this time, but, as the title makes clear, Train Smoke.\n\"When we look back at the landscape works of Gallen-Kallela and Biese, we are reminded of how much of the environment has changed in the intervening century,\" writes Anna-Maria Pennonen in her essay Changing Landscapes in the exhibition catalogue. \"The Baltic Sea no longer freezes every winter, and the period when the ground is covered with snow in Helsinki can be very short, perhaps only a few weeks instead of months.\" As for the magnificent boreal forest, it continues to be threatened by logging and agriculture.\nRecognising the mutability of these environments now adds a powerful new dimension when a modern audience engages with these 100-year-old works. \"They ask us to think about the enchanting image of the forest in relation to its past and current transformation, as well as in relation to our own part therein,\" writes Helga Christoffersen in the catalogue. The works invite feelings of nostalgia and melancholy, and our appreciation that they are endangered only amplifies their beauty and psychological intensity.\nDanish artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen, born in 1987, addresses this issue of climate change in Boreal Dreams (2024), an interactive, immersive work and online experience, commissioned for Northern Lights. The work uses virtual reality to connect past, present and future boreal ecosystems.

        "article_text": "Historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela explores life, love and death on Earth's second-tallest peak in the new season of Extreme.\nStraddling the border of Pakistan and China in the Karakoram mountain range, K2 is often referred to as the \"savage mountain\". Towering 8,611m and reaching into the heavens like a snowcapped pyramid, K2 is the world's second-tallest mountain (topped only by Everest) and arguably the hardest to climb. In Peak Danger, the second season of BBC's Extreme podcast, host and historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela chronicles the harrowing tale of newlyweds Cecilie Skog and Rolf Bae, who scaled K2 in 2008 \u2013 and found themselves in a disaster that would see 11 climbers lose their lives in two days.\nFor Skog, the allure of the mountains came early. She was born surrounded by formidable peaks and explains that even as a child, she often found herself drawn to the alpine heights all around her. Like many climbers, she called the rush of scaling mountains \"addictive\".\n\"I grew up in \u00c5lesund, a little town on the west coast of Norway, and surrounding this little town is mountains everywhere. It is really beautiful there,\" Skog says on the podcast. \"These mountains, they should have given it with, like a warning sign: 'this is really addictive.'\"\nWhile climbing mountains all over the world, Skog also found love and married climber Rolf Bae. After years of honing their skills, the couple decided their honeymoon would be the perfect opportunity to venture to Asia and attempt to scale K2. Their journey started in Pakistan at the Baltoro Glacier, a near-mythical landscape home to six peaks over 7,900m. The beautiful, nearly untouched scenery is one draw, but it is accompanied by the thrill of high altitude, steep cliffs and breathtaking ascents \u2013 and the always-present spectre of cheating death.\n\"If you are going to take on K2, you got to be at the top of your game. That is why it is known, in climbing circles, as 'the mountaineer's mountain,'\" Petrzela says. That reputation was something Skog and Bae were well aware of, as well as the inevitable possibility of facing a life-or-death emergency.\n\"The most important thing cannot be to summit; the most important thing has to be to come back home alive,\" Skog says in the podcast.\nUpon their arrival to the Karakoram Range, Skog and Bae joined some 30 hopeful, optimistic climbers from far-flung countries such as Serbia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and South Korea, as well as a team of Nepalese and Pakistani porters. They were experienced and knowledgeable about the conditions, the dangers and the possibility of inclement weather. Avalanches, rockfall and unpredictable blizzards weren't unheard of \u2013 but there was another sign: a memorial at the beginning of the journey dedicated to those who had lost their lives while attempting to scale K2.\n\"When you arrive, you see a huge pile of brown, weathered rocks, all stacked on top of one another. It is adorned with crisscrossing flags, and pictures of fallen climbers,\" Petrzela says.\nThe memorial isn't enough to deter climbers, nor is the low oxygen level and bitingly cold temperatures.\n\"What I experienced was: 'why am I here\u2026 am I in the right place?' I questioned myself. I questioned my motivation for being there,\" fellow climber Dr Eric Meyer says on the podcast. \"And then you start to reflect on\u2026 is it worth the risk?\"\nListen to the whole Extreme story\nPeak Danger is season 2 of Extreme, the BBC podcast about those who chase the impossible, who strive for superhuman status and refuse to accept that life has any limits. Historian and podcaster Natalia Mehlman Petrzela returns with a sky-high story of human vs nature and surviving against all the odds.\u00a0\nIf you would like to listen to the full podcast series, search for Extreme wherever you get your podcasts.\u00a0\nIt has never been easier for intrepid travellers to challenge themselves and face K2. Petrzela explains on the podcast that a cottage industry has materialised and offers all the necessities for anyone hoping to be among the few who can say they've summited the mountain. However, that commercialisation has led to concerns over climbers' safety and the sometimes-laissez-faire approach to what is undoubtedly a very dangerous trek.\n\"There is no rulebook to mountain climbing. No international association telling you what or how to climb. And there is nothing to stop anyone from making mountaineering into big business. Nowadays, for the right price, you too can buy your way onto the slopes of an 8,000m peak,\" Petrzela says. While there is no association overseeing all climbers, there is the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (or UIAA), which \"developed standards for over 25 types of safety equipment, including helmets, harnesses and [crampons]\".\nAs the group faced a few unexpected challenges \u2013 including a curious case of missing equipment \u2013 Skog explains that the prospect of turning around did enter her mind, but she was still drawn to the peak. \"[I thought] we should turn around, because this is crazy. But again... we are looking up and we can see the summit there. We are so close,\" Skog says. \"The closer you get to the summit, the harder it is to turn around.\"\n\"It is like a kind of compulsion, an inexorable force pulling them further and further up the mountain,\" Petrzela says.\nIn what would later be known as the 2008 K2 disaster \u2013 coming after a similar 1986 tragedy that saw five people die on the mountain \u2013 a massive ice avalanche swept away climbers' rope lines, causing many to fall from an especially treacherous section of the mountain known as the \"Bottlekneck\". The incident killed 11 climbers, including Bae. Even the ones lucky enough to make it off K2 were dealing with frostbite and other injuries. Survivors, Petrzela explains, felt \"shellshocked, like a soldier returning from war.\"\nThe names of the climbers were added to the makeshift memorial at basecamp. Reports would call the incident \"one of the worst tragedies in Himalayan history\".\nMore like this: \n \u2022\u00a0The big climate moments to look out for in 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Why some of the world's borders are changing\n\u2022\u00a0The mountaineers collecting hard-to-reach data\nStill, Skog continued adventuring \u2013 partly, she says, to feel the same sense of wonder she shared with her husband. She enlisted friends to trek across Greenland and, later, she completed an unassisted crossing of Antarctica. She has even returned to the Himalayas, though her new perspective has shifted everything, even summit fever.\n\"I did not have the same feeling being there. I felt that this does not belong to me anymore,\" she says.\n*This article is adapted from a script by Natalia Mehlman Petrzela and Leigh Meyer.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Dubai is synonymous with luxury and pampering, and Huda Beauty founder Huda Kattan knows where to find it. Here are her Dubai picks, from heavenly massages to crystal shopping.\nIn just half a century, the Emirati city of Dubai has gone from a small fishing village on the banks of the Dubai Creek to a thriving metropolis synonymous with over-the-top luxury. It's home to the Burj Khalifa \u2013 the world's tallest tower \u2013 and Deep Dive Dubai \u2013 the world's deepest pool \u2013 and it's now building the $2bn (\u00a31.64bn) mega-mall Dubai Square, the largest in the world.\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nBut even though it plays hard, Dubai doesn't forget to take care of itself; it was recently named the World's Best Spa Destination 2024 at the World Spa Awards.\nTo get to the heart of this burgeoning capital of self-care, we spoke to makeup artist-turned beauty mogul Huda Kattan, who has called Dubai home since 2008.\nThe SpeciaList\nBeauty blogger, makeup artist and entrepreneur Huda Kattan worked in finance before founding the billion-dollar cosmetics brand Huda Beauty \u2013 beloved for its wildly popular eyeshadow palettes and viral products like the Easy Blur foundation. In 2023, she was featured on the BBC's 100 Women list.\nFor Kattan, who was born and raised in the United States but lived in the UAE for two years as a child, moving to Dubai was a homecoming. \"It's an extremely fast paced, multicultural environment,\" says Kattan, who travels endlessly around the globe for her work as the founder and CEO of Huda Beauty cosmetics. \"It's probably one of the fastest-moving [cities] I've ever seen. When I go to New York, New York is way too slow for me.\"\nKattan, whose brand headquarters is in Dubai, loves hitting the spa in her downtime. \"[It's] the best,\" she says. \"It's about going to the spas, enjoying the massages, doing the hammams, the facials. It's about investing in yourself for sure.\"\nAnd Dubai's foothold in the beauty world is also growing. Dior opened its first spa in the city in 2024 and the five-star Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab hotel with its three-storey spa will open in 2025. \"Dubai is definitely getting a lot more credibility in beauty,\" says Kattan. \"I have big celebrities asking me, 'What is happening in Dubai? What are all the treatments that people are doing?'\"\nBut self-care in Dubai isn't just about spa treatments; its glamorous shops are a strong prescription for retail therapy, while its stunning coastal panoramas refresh mind, body and soul.\nHere are Kattan's favourite ways to indulge in self-care in Dubai.\nKattan experienced her first-ever massage in Dubai 16 years ago and was instantly hooked. \"I'd never had a massage in my life until I moved here,\" she says. \"When I got my first massage, I fell asleep and was snoring and slobbering. I was like, 'What is this? This is the best experience of my life'. I now have them regularly.\"\nVisitors will find a massage to suit every budget, from designer spas to at-home mobile massages. Kattan is a fan of both, but enthuses that those looking to splurge can\u2019t go wrong with the Guerlain Spa at the One&Only The Palm hotel found on the tip of the manmade Palm Jumeriah island.\nThe Guerlain Spa features a leafy Arabic courtyard resplendent with regal fountains and a marble lobby with its own mini Guerlain boutique. Kattan was smitten from the moment she first stepped through the door. \"[It's] like a movie. It's amazing,\" she says.\nKattan usually goes for a deep tissue massage, while her husband, Portuguese businessman Christopher Goncalo, prefers the Thai massage technique. Kattan says she used to enjoy Swedish massages, but now she seeks out a sports massage treatment. \"I don't even want the relaxation anymore. I want them to work me out,\" she says. \u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.guerlain.com/ae/en-ae/guerlain-spa-one-and-only-the-palm-dubai.html \n Address: One&Only The Palm West Crescent, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai\n Phone: +971 4 440 1040\n Instagram: @guerlain/\nHammams \u2013 steam-filled public bathhouses \u2013 have been part of Middle Eastern culture as early as the 7th Century, serving not only as a place to wash off the desert sand, but a space to socialise.\nWhile modern plumbing has since been introduced, getting scrubbed clean in a room full of steam is still a hallmark of the Middle Eastern spa experience.\nTip:\n\"It's a very classy society,\" says Kattan. \"People will not look at you if you are dressed a certain way, but [they might] if you're maybe acting a little loud.\" Kattan says that she also had to take it down a notch: \"I'm American; we're very loud and I learned to adjust.\"\nKattan recommends the Talise Ottoman Spa on the West Crescent of The Palm. \"I went on my birthday. It was just the best experience,\" she says.\nThe cleansing ritual at Talise Ottoman Spa takes place in a domed marble room decorated in mosaics, where clients recline on a heated marble bed to have their skin exfoliated with a kese mitt, then revived with their choice of a honey, lavender and mint mask, or one made with purifying rose or gold.\nAfterwards, visitors can relax in one of the private majlis (cabanas) that surround a pool lit by a glittering chandelier. \"You sit there and they bring you a yogurt drink, dates and apricots,\" says Kattan. \"I was, like, I'm sure I'm in the 1600s and I'm a princess.\"\nWebsite: https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/dubai/jumeirah-zabeel-saray/wellbeing/signature-talise-ottoman-spa\n Address: Jumeirah Zabeel Saray, West Crescent, The Palm Jumeirah, Dubai \n Phone: +971 4 453 0455\n Instagram: @jumeirah \nTo truly indulge her senses, Kattan loves visiting fragrance stores.\nBedouins have been crafting seductive fragrances like heady oud from resinous woods or earthy frankincense from the gum of the Boswellia tree for centuries. \"Abdul\u00a0Samad Al Qurashi is I think the most luxurious, and they do really beautiful fragrances,\" says Kattan of the historic Saudi Arabian fragrance house, known for crafting fine fragrances since 1852. \"And Ajmal has a really beautiful store in Dubai Mall. There's also Hind Al\u00a0Oud. [Fragrance is] a big part of the culture.\"\nBut Kattan says visitors don\u2019t always need to splurge on expensive scents; they can seek out lesser-known brands: \"You can go to the souqs and buy little ones,\" she says. \"They're not necessarily ones you want to wear on a daily basis, but [the bottles are] cute trinkets. I would go to the souqs and buy the oils [and] ouds, and have [those] on my dresser.\"\nEmiratis enjoy layering their fragrance, starting with a base of oil on the pulse points, then spritzing fragrance all over the body and, finally, capturing the scent of bakhoor incense made from wood chips soaked in fragrant oils. \"They put their abaya (robe) on [the bakhoor]. Sometimes their hair will just take a little bit of smoke and it's quite beautiful,\" says Kattan. \"I've experienced it. It's amazing.\"\nWebsite: https://en-ae.ajmal.com/ \n Address: Ajmal Perfume, first floor, Dubai Mall\n Phone: +971-4-457-4111\n Instagram: @ajmalperfumes\nDubai has a global reputation as a go-to destination for luxury jewellery at tax-free prices, but when Kattan craves something sparkly, she splurges on decorative crystals.\n\"I have crystals everywhere. I'm a big crystal person,\" says Kattan, who loves placing them on windowsills and in bowls around her home in Dubai. Of the numerous glitzy crystal boutiques scattered throughout town, Kattan has a favourite: \"There's one crystal store called OOAKSTONES (One Of A Kind stones).\"\nLocated in Dubai's Alserkal Avenue arts district,\u00a0OOAKSTONES offers a highly curated selection of crystals, ranging from artisanal jewellery and statement pieces to home decor.\nKattan notes that in Dubai, crystals often cost around one-tenth the price one might spend elsewhere, and she believes visitors should make time for crystal shopping in their schedule. \"It's overwhelming and it's amazing and if you're coming to the Middle East [it's definitely something] you should do,\" says Kattan.\nWebsite: https://ooakstones.com/ \n Address: Warehouse 20 (Inside Kave), Alserkal Avenue, Dubai\n Phone: +971 52 481 6700\n Instagram: @ooakstones\nFrom dive-in cinemas and air-conditioned cabanas to loungers emblazoned with fashion brands, Dubai's beach clubs are an unabashedly glamorous affair.\nTip:\nDuring November and December, the desert temperature drops to a cool 25C. This Mediterranean-style weather can attract the crowds, so Kattan suggests choosing a hotel wisely during the high season. \"You're going to need to find a hotel in a really good location,\" says Kattan. \"I would not recommend The Palm [during peak months]. Getting in and out of it is a nightmare. I would recommend something more central.\" Kattan says that October and March are still great options for cooler months, but if you still want to go during peak season, Kattan jokes: \"Go to a hotel where you don't need to leave.\"\nKattan's go-to beach experience is SAL on the terrace of the seven-star Burj Al Arab Hotel, overlooking the Persian Gulf. \"It has a beautiful and calm setting with an amazing view. [It's the] perfect [place] to relax for the day,\" she says.\nSAL is open year-round, though Dubai's beach clubs are most popular during the cooler winter months. The trendy oasis features a stunning infinity pool and is home to the brand-new Sunset Lounge, a chic space with eye-catching mirrored walls. Guests can relax on the club's submerged pool loungers or hole up in one of the private air-conditioned cabanas complete with their own balconies and ensuite bathrooms. SAL also offers several poolside dining menus, with treats ranging from chilled starters and Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes to decadent desserts, as well as a luxe cocktail list and full shisha bar. Complimentary ice lollies and gazpacho shots add a touch of whimsy to the Gulf's glorious sunsets, and summertime visitors are welcome to stay until dark for a dip under the stars.\nWebsite: https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/dubai/burj-al-arab-jumeirah/dining/burj-al-arab-sal\n Address: Ground Mezzanine Floor, Burj Al Arab, Jumeirah Street, Dubai\n Phone: +971 800 323232\n Instagram: @sal_burjalarab\nThe upscale neighbourhood of Jumeriah is home to Lucia Aesthetic Dermatology Clinic; founded by renowned dermatologist Dr Radmila Lukian.

        "article_text": "As travellers flock to the English countryside to celebrate the renowned novelist, we asked experts to weigh in on the best Austen-themed festivals, reenactments and balls of the year.\nWith bonnets and boarding passes ready, a brigade of Jane Austen fans from around the world is preparing to bombard Britain, eager to celebrate one of English literature's greatest writers throughout 2025 on her 250th birthday.\nFrom the dashing John Willoughby in Sense and Sensibility to the spirited Emma Woodhouse in the eponymous Emma, Austen's characters have enchanted generations of readers, inspiring yearly pilgrimages to her home county of Hampshire and beyond to trace her footsteps. This year, these journeys take on a celebratory air as travellers flock to the English countryside for literary festivals, reenactments and Regency balls designed to pay tribute to the author.\nHere are the year's most ostentatious events, according to Austen experts \u2013 the ones promising fans an unforgettable birthday bash for a writer who presciently wrote, \"One cannot have too large a party.\"\nAlthough her vivid portrayals of English life now epitomise the extravagance of the Georgian era, Austen's own story began modestly. She was born on 16 December 1775, in the village of Steventon, in Hampshire, England, the seventh child and youngest daughter of clergyman George Austen and his wife Cassandra.\n\"It must have been a bustling household, with the large Austen family and the boys her father tutored,\" said Janet Todd, one of Britain's leading Austen scholars. Although the rectory where the Austens lived was demolished in 1824, St Nicholas Church, where they worshipped, still stands. A dedicated team of volunteers is working to ensure every visit to the historic chapel is memorable.\nNot at all bowing to the idea of being the country cousin to the author's more well-known former towns, like Bath and Chawton, Steventon has organised lively events for June, July and December. Visitors can attend the Jane Austen's Words and Music Chamber concert on 8 June\u00a0 at her family's chapel or join a country fair on 6 June held in the same pump field where the Austen's parsonage home once stood. Then, in remembrance, the church will hold a special Thanksgiving Service for Austen on her birthday on 16 December.\nIn Austen's England, balls were pivotal to social life and courtship among the middle and upper classes. For Zack Pinsent, a 29-year-old tailor known for exclusively wearing Regency-era attire, attending a ball is the ultimate tribute to Austen. This year's calendar is packed with options, from a Regency Week Ball in Alton this June to a Yuletide Birthday Ball in Bath come December. However, Pinsent recommends the Brighton Royal Grand Pavilion Ball on January 25, which he is organising and has already drawn attendees from 16 countries.\n\"Anyone can attend, as long as they have the right outfit,\" said Pinsent, who has secured the Royal Pavilion for the eponymous Regency-inspired event.\nBrighton's Royal Pavilion, built by George IV, Austen's contemporary and admirer, hosted extravagant balls in its heyday. Though there's no evidence Austen ever visited, Pinsent speculates she may have, given Brighton's influence on her imagination. The seaside town even earned a mention in Pride and Prejudice, when Austen wrote of Lydia Bennet: \"At Brighton, she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\"\nAusten set two of her novels, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, in Bath, but her feelings about the resort town remain debated. Her famously dramatic reaction to her family's move there from Steventon \u2013 she allegedly fainted \u2013 hints at reluctance. Still, during her years in Bath (1801-1806), its vibrant social scene, from galas at Sydney Gardens to events at the Assembly Rooms, inspired her work. However, personal tragedy, including her father's death during this time, likely influenced her perception of the city.\n\"The party line is, we don't really know how she felt about Bath,\" said Georgia Delve, director of the Jane Austen Centre Festival (held 12-21 September in Bath). \"But I think in terms of her storyline and the characters, you walk around the city, and it's all written in the stone: you get Bennett Street, you've got Bartlett Street, you've got the Assembly Rooms, you've got the Royal Crescent, you've got the Paragon, you know, great Pulteney Street. All these places come up in her letters and novels.\"\nBath's enduring love for Austen is clear, exemplified by its Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of people in Regency costumes. This year's Austen Festival begins with a grand promenade, drawing fans worldwide.\nBeyond the festival, the Jane Austen Centre is hosting two summer Regency balls, including a Persuasion-themed Nautical Ball on 31 May and a unique Sanditon-inspired event based on Austen's unfinished novel of the same name on 28 June. The event will include dance workshops to master waltzes and cotillions.\nThe port city of Southampton played a role in Austen's life on three occasions \u2013 an often-overlooked fact that the town is hoping to rectify this year. She briefly attended boarding school there, celebrated her 18th birthday at the city's historic Dolphin Hotel, and later stayed there with her brother after departing Bath. To honour the city's deep ties, Southampton plans to display her travel writing desk now through \u200b\u200b23 February at God's House Tower, on loan from the British Library as part of the exhibit In Training for a Heroine. The portable mahogany desk was a gift from her father, and on it, she wrote what she referred to as \"My own darling child,\" the first draft of Pride and Prejudice. Tickets are free, but visitors must reserve a time to see the installation.\nAccording to Todd, much of Austen's enduring appeal lies in her connection to a romanticised England. Hampshire, where she lived, wrote, and set many of her novels, preserved its charm by avoiding industrialisation. This timeless quality makes a visit to the author's former home in Chawton, now called Jane Austen's House, a uniquely transportive experience. After her father's death left Jane, her sister and their mother nearly penniless, with only \u00a3210 a year, according to Todd, Jane's brother Edward eventually moved them into his cottage in 1809. It was here, in this idyllic setting, that Jane refined her six novels.\nMore like this:\n \u2022 What Jane Austen can teach us about resilience\n \u2022 Britain's greatest natural wonders to explore in the wintertime\n \u2022 The UK's five most beautiful national parks\nTo celebrate the writer's 250th birthday, the Jane Austen House hosts a Pride and Prejudice Festival from 23-28 January, featuring Austenmania, a year-long exhibit dedicated to her posthumous cinematic legacy. The site has also launched a permanent exhibition, Jane Austen and the Art of Writing, showcasing her creative process and first editions of her works. \"It's quite moving to be in there with them,\" said 15-year docent Janie McShane of the priceless tomes. For many visitors, that's the real allure, to see how Austen lived, \"to tread,\" McShane said, \"where she tread\".\nAusten was an enthusiastic walker. In a world where a woman's life was nearly always spent supervised or in the company of family and friends, taking a stroll likely meant freedom and escape. \"Austen's characters walk to be themselves and to change,\" writes Rachel Cohen in Austen Years: A Memoir in Five Novels. \nPat Lerew, chair of the Jane Austen Alton Group, says her village will give visitors the same opportunity. Alton is reasonably short stroll from Austen's House. \"We know Jane and her sister walked into Alton two or three times a week to shop or visit with friends,\" Lerew said. \"She would also pick up the coach here to go to London.\" Similarly, the 10-day Jane Austen Regency Week (20-29 June) will include a Regency Day with stalls and entertainment guests can peruse, followed by a ribbon cutting on a new public Jane Austen Garden.\nThe final chapter of Jane's life was tragic. At 41, she fell ill with a mysterious condition that modern experts have speculated may have been Addison's disease or Hodgkin lymphoma. Her deteriorating condition required a move from Chawton cottage to Winchester to seek specialised care. Jane and her sister Cassandra took up residence at No. 8 College Street, a property now owned by Winchester College, a historic boarding school attended by eight of Austen's nephews. This summer, for the first time ever, the school is opening the apartments to the public.\n\"The apartment remains strikingly similar to how it was in Austen's time,\" said Richard Foster, the Fellows' Librarian and Keeper of Collections at the college, who has played a key role in organising the opening. \"Austen describes a neat little drawing room with a bay window overlooking the headmaster's garden, and those features are still intact.\" It was in this space that Austen penned her final poem, and from the same bay window, Cassandra watched her sister's funeral procession \u2013 restricted by 19th-Century customs that barred women from attending.\nTickets for this limited-time opening are available online. Visitors can also honour Austen at her final resting place in the north nave of Winchester Cathedral. Her simple gravestone, devoid of any mention of her literary brilliance, seems almost ironic \u2013 a fact Austen herself might have found darkly amusing. The modest epitaph only nods to the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", a description she might have skewered with her signature wit. After all, as she once wrote, \"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "With her sultry drawl and feline charisma, the singer and actor oozed sophistication. But Eartha Kitt, who was born on 17 January 1927, had the toughest of childhoods. In History looks at how she transcended her troubled beginnings to become a star of stage and screen \u2013 and the first black Catwoman.\nCelebrated by Orson Welles as the \"most exciting woman in the world\", and smeared by the CIA as a \"sadistic nymphomaniac\", Eartha Kitt had an extraordinary life and career. After joining Katherine Dunham's pioneering African-American dance company, she was on Broadway by the age of 19, and went on to become a cabaret sensation in London and Paris. Her smouldering 1950s performances of songs such as Santa Baby, Just an Old-Fashioned Girl and I Want to be Evil have never been bettered. In 1967, she wowed mainstream television audiences as Catwoman in the third series of the camp classic Batman. Later, she won a new generation of fans as the villain Yzma in Disney's 2000 cartoon The Emperor's New Groove. She died on Christmas Day in 2008, aged 81.\nBorn Eartha Mae Keith on a South Carolina cotton plantation on 17 January 1927, she had a start in life that could hardly have been more difficult. She never knew her father, and her mother left her to be raised by various relatives. Speaking on BBC Wales' Late Call in 1971, she said: \"I remember at times when we didn't have anything to eat for what seemed like an insurmountable amount of time. We had to rely on the forest and whatever we could dig out of the ground, such as weeds or a grass I remember that had a kind of onion growing at the bottom of it. And when we could find things like that to eat then we were alright.\"\nDescribing her childhood self as an \"urchin\", she said: \"I'm very glad that she will always be a part of me because she helps me do what she knows I have to do out there on that stage.\"\nDespite being such a confident and poised performer, raw emotion was never far from the surface when Kitt was interviewed, as shown when Ronnie Williams, the host of Late Call, read her one of her quotes: \"You said, 'My mother gave me away at the age of five, and if my mother gives me away, she doesn't want me. So why should anybody want me?'\" Kitt replied that because of this abandonment, she had always lived with the feeling \"that the most important person in the world didn't want you\". She added: \"I think there are many explanations I can make for my mother giving me away and I think that, even though I have tried to explain within myself as to why she gave me away, it's still very difficult for me to accept it.\"\nDecades later, Kitt's beloved daughter Kitt Shapiro revealed that the singer died without knowing the identity of her white father. She told the Observer in 2013 that her mother wept when she finally saw her birth certificate, only to discover that the man's name had been blanked out by officials to protect his reputation in the segregated American South.\nBecause of her mixed heritage, Kitt told Williams on Late Call that she was not accepted by the black community. She said: \"They don't understand that I don't think of myself in terms of being a black person. I think of myself as being a person who belongs to everybody, but I think one should always feel this way. I think that, as long as you are feeling in terms of belonging only to one race, one nationality, one religion, that you have to be prejudiced\u2026 I am an illegitimate child, and at the same time I was not of completely black parentage. My father was supposedly a Caucasian, and my grandparents are Cherokee Indians. My mother was half black and all of this, and therefore my blood is of yours and of anybody's and therefore I've always thought of myself as this, and to be prejudiced against any of the other bloods is rather silly to me.\"\nIN HISTORY\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nAccording to Kitt, her travels had convinced her that financial inequality was at the root of so much prejudice around the world: \"When we are able to recognise that no matter what colour or religion you belong to, that you are capable of gaining as much as the next person can, no matter what race or religion he belongs to, I think the situation would be much healthier.\"\nThe singer and actor was being interviewed on BBC Wales to promote her week-long residency at the Double Diamond Club in Caerphilly, a scenic town near Cardiff. While the popular venue did in its time host big stars such as Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash, it was still a long way from Broadway.\nIn the US at that time, Kitt was cancelled. Her career had faltered following a White House luncheon in 1968 to discuss the causes of juvenile delinquency with Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of President Lyndon B Johnson. As protests against the Vietnam War raged across the US, Kitt's diagnosis of the problem's causes upset the genteel audience. She told the First Lady: \"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don't want to go to school because they're going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.\"\nIn response, the CIA compiled a dossier on her. The New York Times revealed in 1975 that this extensive report contained \"second\u2010hand gossip about the entertainer but no evidence of any foreign intelligence connections\". Asked in later years about the notorious \"nymphomaniac\" claim reported to be contained in the document, Kitt was supremely dismissive: \"What has that got to do with the CIA if I was?\"\nWhile her career back home was in the doldrums, she spent time in Britain touring provincial clubs. During one such residency at the distinctly unglamorous Batley Variety Club in West Yorkshire, a BBC reporter asked her how such a sophisticated celebrity could feel an affinity with local people there. She replied: \"I wasn't born in such a different world. I came out of extreme poverty. I have acquired things, yes. The things have not acquired me.\"\nIt wasn't until 1978, ten years after that White House incident, that Kitt made her triumphant Broadway return in the musical Timbuktu!. She remained a frequent visitor to Britain, often making outrageous appearances on television talk shows. Again, her vulnerability was never too far from the surface. In one spectacular 1989 BBC appearance, she began by resting her feet flirtatiously on the lap of host Terry Wogan. Just a few minutes later, she was confessing that her public persona was nothing like her private self.\nShe said: \"Mr Wogan, you know something? I'm not an extrovert. I can tease as 'Eartha Kitt', but as Eartha Mae? Forget it. I'm hiding behind the bushes, behind the chairs, behind everything I could possibly find to hide behind, because I've never had that kind of security within Eartha Mae that makes me feel that she will ever be accepted.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How a child star saved a Hollywood studio\n\u2022 Nina Simone on how fury fuelled her songs\n\u2022 Toni Morrison on her mission to please black fans\nKitt's abiding loves were her fans and her daughter. Having been abandoned by her own mother, Kitt insisted on bringing her daughter with her all over the world. Her marriage to businessman Bill McDonald in 1960 lasted less than four years, and she never remarried. Asked by Wogan if she had been reluctant to let her guard down, she said: \"A man has always wanted to lay me down, but he never wanted to pick me up.\"\nShe said that it was the love she received from adoring crowds that \"makes me feel that I really am a worthwhile person\". However, she also explained: \"When I go back to the dressing room, I take off the makeup and I'm not 'Eartha Kitt' anymore, I'm Eartha Mae again.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "Children played on fairground rides designed by the world's greatest artists for a single summer before they disappeared for decades.\nThe attractions were part of the world's first art funfair - Luna Luna - dreamed up by little-known Austrian creative Andr\u00e9 Heller in the 1970s, featuring a carousel by Keith Haring, a Ferris wheel by Jean-Michel Basquiat and a David Hockney pavilion.\nVisitors could wander Roy Lichtenstein's hall of mirrors and marvel at Salvador Dali's fun dome, sampling biscuits decorated by artist Gertie Fr\u00f6lich as actors dressed as nuns and flamingos milled about.\nA successful attraction for months, plans for a grand European tour formed - but when they later fell through, an extensive legal battle ensued and the rides were shut down, disassembled and packed away, forgotten.\nUntil now.\nAmerican entrepreneur Michael Goldberg stumbled across Luna Luna on an art blog. He'd never heard of it, despite some of the art world's biggest names contributing. Neither, to his surprise, had his friends in the industry.\n\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"\n'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.\nThe two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly. \nOpening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation. \nThe foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.\nDecades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen. \nHis key investor? Global rap star Drake, via his investment and entertainment business DreamCrew.\n\"The idea of restoring something so rich in cultural history outweighed the risks and for us, it wasn't about guarantees,\" Anthony Gonzales, CEO of DreamCrew, told the BBC.\nThe New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.\nWhen he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.\n\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.\nIt was a sleepless night.\nBut the next day, as more paper was removed from a second container, the light caught a toffee-apple-red handlebar to Haring's carousel, then the white floorboards of  Basquiat's Ferris wheel, which \"could have been painted days ago\". It was a moment of \"instant relief\", said Goldberg.\nUnearthing the artwork wasn't the hardest part of Luna Luna's revival.\nBrad Gooch, author of recent official Haring biography, Radiant: The Life and Line of Keith Haring, saw Luna Luna being reconstructed, describing the feat as \"mind boggling.\"\n\"It was like a giant Lego with no instruction kit,\" he said.\nA crew of artists, carnival technicians, curators and architects worked together to meticulously rebuild Luna Luna for two years before its grand reopening in LA this March.\nNow, Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy has come to a Midtown Manhattan art and theatre complex, The Shed. The fair is on display alongside exhibits detailing its surreal curation process. \nAlex Poots, creative co-founder of The Shed, described the journey as a \"Raiders of the Lost Ark story\", in reference to the film, praising Heller's ability to commission artists of such high calibre while finding a format appealing to \"art lovers and yet to be art lovers.\"\n\"That is a holy grail kind of pursuit,\" he added. \nMost of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s. \nHockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.\nGoldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space. \nDrake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.\nThere's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.\nBasquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.\nHaring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.\n\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"\nPoots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"\nBut he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\". \nIt has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".\nHe added that ticket prices, criticised by some as being too high, are \"pretty reasonable\" as the show cost \"millions and millions of dollars to install\".\nAmong the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.\nHaring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".\nThe show is running from 20 November to 23 February, and will tour after it leaves The Shed.",

        "article_text": "The Oscar-tipped film by RaMell Ross adapts Colson Whitehead's novel about two boys at an abusive \"reform\" school and shoots it from their point of view. The effect is profound.\nThere's no film this year, perhaps no film this decade, that looks and feels like Nickel Boys. The innovative new film from director RaMell Ross is based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead about an abusive \"reform\" school for boys, and provides a revolutionary perspective on the US's racist past (and how it always informs the present), during the era of Jim Crow. This is in part because it focuses on the human experience rather than oppressive systems and punishment, above all through its use of a first-person viewpoint. Ross drops us behind the eyes of Elwood (Ethan Herisse), an idealistic young man living in Florida in the 1960s, a bright future ahead of him. That's cut short when he's wrongfully convicted of car theft and sent to Nickel Academy. The school is functionally a jail, based on a real institution in Florida known for the discovery of dozens of unmarked graves on its property.\nAt Nickel, Elwood meets another young man named Turner (Brandon Wilson), who has a more cynical outlook on the civil rights movement that is unfolding at the time of their imprisonment. Ross frequently switches perspectives, not just between first-person and third-person framing (where the camera is locked to behind the character's head) but also between the viewpoints of Elwood and Turner, letting us see each character how their friend sees them and transforming our view of each in the process. Like the book, it also periodically checks in with an adult Elwood (Daveed Diggs) reckoning with what happened.\nRoss says that the camerawork in Nickel Boys is designed to reflect how every human being is the centre of their own world, but also how they experience the world in a way that they haven't yet processed. \"It's about giving the person \u2013 about giving Elwood \u2013 not the hindsight of ourselves, which is to look at things as if they're meaningful, but just to look at things that will become meaningful,\" he tells the BBC. \"So the narrative will always be secondary to the experience of looking.\"\nAwards Watch\nNickel Boys has been nominated for two Academy Awards. The film earned nods in the Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay categories. Nickel Boys is also nominated for a Bafta award in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. Click here for more on the films getting awards buzz.\nThe way in which Elwood and Turner's individual experiences are presented through the cameras \u2013 which were operated by Ross himself as well as cinematographer Jomo Fray and another cameraman, Sam Ellison, so they could each take breaks \u2013 includes movement mimicking that of a person's eyes; the characters voices' come from off screen, and you see their hands and feet, and sometimes their faces if they look at a reflective surface. Sometimes you really feel the restriction of their point of view, such as when they are getting chased and can't tell how far someone is behind them, or hear menacing noises around the corner in their racially segregated hometown.\nIn order to create that point of view, the practical requirements of shooting in first person were demanding, but also allowed for spontaneity. Ross and Fray did away with a lot of the traditional structuring and planning of shots, and things were adjusted depending on the scene.\nRoss says that \"the blocking became more gestural\" \u2013 more about considering what the character would be looking at, and how to make it so that body parts showed up in frame correctly, than it was about about traditional orchestration of how and where actors moved. For the filming of some of these point-of-view shots, the actor for the character whose eyes we are looking through wasn't even on set.\nNickel Boys isn't the first film to use first-person cinematography, but it's certainly the first mainstream film release to use it in such a profound way. In the past, it's a technique which has mostly been reserved for gimmicky horrors or action films that are often emulating first-person shooter video games \u2013 take for example 2017 Korean film The Villainess, or the (awful) 2015 sci-fi thriller Hardcore Henry.\nNickel Boys goes in the opposite direction to these types of films \u2013 instead of using the first-person point of view in service of pumped-up sensationalism, Ross is looking to throw out traditional narrative form and create something much more impressionistic. It's a striking choice, in particular, for a film based on a novel, when so often such adaptations rely on chunks of diaristic voiceover and rigid structure. Nickel Boys shows how offering a visual window into the things that a character pays attention to is as good as internal monologue in helping the audience to understand them.\nTo Ross, the choice to shoot a lot of the film from the first-person viewpoint seemed obvious. \"Why can't we get closer to our sensibility and subjectivity on screen,\" he asks. In particular, he says, adopting the first person POV \"seemed to me just to be an act that would be refreshing for black folks, to look up on the screen and see their hands are doing something in the world. For many years I've been like, 'Why has no one ever made [a film like] this?'\"\nRoss acknowledges that he is hardly the first filmmaker to use first person \u2013 he cites Harmony Korine's recent experimental action film Aggro Dr1ft (2023) \u2013 but it's the context in which he uses it which sets him apart. His editing collapses scenes together into something resembling stream-of-consciousness, and this experiential viewpoint feels especially significant when applied to Nickel Boys' subject matter: all too often, this era of American race relations and racism is depicted from the outside looking in.\n\"An original concept in the writing process was, 'What happened if you give Elwood and Turner a camera to make their own Hale County, right?'\" Ross says, referring to his acclaimed 2018 documentary Hale County This Morning, This Evening. That film, which made his name, was an extremely intimate, again impressionistic portrait of the black community in the Alabama town of Hale County, where Ross moved in 2009. \"Cameras weren't portable, obviously, they weren't digital in the 50s, 60s and 70s,\" Ross continues. \"And so no one would ever be able to gather enough footage to make something as poetic and as observational as that.\" With Nickel Boys, he and Fray wondered about \"how what people understand to be the image of black people [would] have changed if in the 60s people had access to show their point of view\".\nEllen Jones, journalist and author of Screen Deep: How Film and TV can Solve Racism and Save the World, praises the groundbreaking effect of the film's formal conceit. \"What is so exciting and impressive about Ross's use of the camera in Nickel Boys is that it demands we consider not just the story, but how the story is told,\" she says. \"The first-person position of the camera eliminates the voyeuristic distance from racist violence, which has been typical [in film], and inserts us in the subjectivity of the black characters. That fact that it feels immersive and never gimmicky is nothing short of miraculous.\"\nMore like this:\n \u2022 12 of the best films to watch in December\n\u2022 The 10 films getting early Oscar buzz\n \u2022 The powerful paintings reframing black experience\nThis first person perspective certainly makes it stand out from the many other films about the Jim Crow era: Jones points out how conventional dramas by white filmmakers, such as Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), Mississippi Burning (1988), Green Book (2018) and Hidden Figures (2016), are designed to speak to a presumed white audience by focusing on sensationalised images of black people in pain.\nRoss's break from a tradition of narrative presentation connects back to an appropriately freeform personal essay he wrote for Film Quarterly titled Renew The Encounter. It speaks of decoupling an idea of \"blackness\" from a commodified, mainstream American sensibility. This aim is reflected in Nickel Boys \u2013 as is the expressed desire to \"create the personal-poetic experience of blackness\". His films do this by taking minute everyday experience and expanding it into an entire visual world, aiming, as he puts it in Renew the Encounter, to \"bring elation to the experience of blackness\". Doing this and being honest about history is a delicate balance, but Nickel Boys achieves it: the suffering of its protagonists is included as an honest reflection of their lives, but its presentation is not the film's only goal.\nThe first-person perspective also naturally puts certain limits on what the camera is showing. Some things are missed purely because the eye can only see so much. Others are excluded because the character simply doesn't want to look, such as in one harrowing scene of corporal punishment in which Elwood avoids seeing what is happening to him, the camera's gaze moving to the ground. \u00a0As such, acts of physical violence often happen in the periphery of the frame \u2013 as Ross puts it, Elwood isn't there collecting evidence. \"No one's in the world to show black suffering at the time in which black suffering is happening,\" Ross says, elaborating on his choice. \"That's not the purpose of them being human in the world \u2013 it's just happening because of the larger context.\"\nLooking back at the basis of Hale County, Ross's manifesto for that film (as shared in Filmmaker Magazine) highlights the point: \"participate, not capture; shoot from not at.\" Nickel Boys might be the epitome of this method, as it shoots from behind its characters' very eyes. That \"participation\" is part of the simple reason why the film stands out from so many other depictions of the same period of troubled American history: it prioritises showing how black people live, not just what we have endured.\nNickel Boys is out now in US cinemas and in UK cinemas from 3 January\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing \u2013 it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.\nThe company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress \u2013 now with over 50 designs \u2013 to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\n\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE\nThe BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business \u2013 and paving the path for other leaders to thrive.\u00a0Read more conversations here.\u00a0\n\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\"\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (\u00a3118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.\nThe company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\n\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\"\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\n\"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure \u2013 loving fashion \u2013 turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\"\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\nHill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing \u2013 great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThere were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and \u2026 start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business \u2013 trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day \u2013 it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.\nWhen we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.\nWhat are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?\nThere were \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.\nIn 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.\nBut when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base \u2013 we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.\nHow do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?\nWe have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.\nYou've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?\nI can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.\nBy the numbers\n1 million nap dresses sold\n50 styles of the Nap Dress\n5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas\n80 employees\n~$150m valuation\nHow have you been expanding the brand?\nWe have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.\nThe home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim \u2013 and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.\nThe fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?\nWe focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.\nWhat advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?\nOne of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me.\nI had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it.

        "article_text": "This year's Global Responsible Tourism Award winners demonstrate that travel can be inclusive, climate-friendly, nature-positive and a positive force for local communities.\nCelebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Responsible Tourism Awards are a standard bearer for the positive side of the travel industry. Run by the non-profit International Centre for Responsible Tourism Global, the awards aim to showcase the benefits of tourism and inspire other firms to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nAwards like these are particularly important at a time when tourism is under pressure. With global travel and tourism numbers back to pre-pandemic levels and one in 10 people employed in the industry, the need to improve the sector's environmental, economic and cultural impact is clear. Lifting up businesses that give back to their local communities creates a win-win for tourists and locals alike. And for travellers interested in supporting local culture, having extraordinary nature experiences and a ensuring a responsible travel industry, the winning firms have demonstrated their ability to do that and more.\u00a0\nTess Longfield, head of sustainability communications at Sabre, who sponsors the awards, commented that extraordinary work is being done by all the winners to create a more sustainable and equitable world through tourism. \"It's a testament to the power of responsible travel to make a real difference,\" she said.\nFrom a private ecolodge in South Africa to a volunteering organisation in a Peruvian biosphere reserve, these are the firms to book with in 2024 and beyond:\nThis five-star ecolodge set in 3,500 hectares of South African wilderness is constantly researching pioneering ways of doing things to improve the lives of the local community and protect the fragile landscapes and wildlife that surround it.\nAs well as offering unique tourism experiences to guests, such as guided walks to the flora-rich fynbos and coastal safaris in in waters teeming with great white sharks and dolphins, Grootbos' lodge provides ecotourism jobs to the local community. Profits from the lodge fund the Grootbos Foundation, which gives free skills and business training for hundreds of local people in the areas of hospitality, horticulture, entrepreneurship and biodiversity. It creates a ripple effect that's much needed during a period of serious unemployment in South Africa.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThe judging team called Grootbos \"an exemplary business that others can learn from\", praising the way that it constantly pushes the boundaries and explores new ways of developing responsible tourism.\u00a0\n\"Grootbos cares about community and conservation,\" said Phil Murray, fundraising, donor relations and communications manager at Grootbos Foundation. \"Neither can be ignored, and both can mutually benefit from programmes and a responsible tourism business that prizes people and planet.\"\nRajasthan Studio curates art experiences with master artisans in Rajasthan, allowing travellers to experience, understand and value the local culture of the place they are visiting. Travellers can visit master artists at their homes and studios, meet their families, see the process behind making local handicrafts and co-create a personalised souvenir with the crafter.\nThe experiences include an insight into rare and unique art forms like puppetry and the blue pottery of Jaipur, pichwai\u00a0art and sea foam carving of Udaipur, leather juttis and tie dye of Jodhpur and much more. The idea is to build a community of artists and scale the business to different parts of Rajasthan, and eventually across India.\u00a0\n\"Rajasthan as a state is blessed with a wonderful art heritage and travellers are eager to explore every bit of it,\" said company founder Kartik Gaggar. \"But why should we limit it to exploring? We asked the same question and the answer was: let's turn it into an experience.\"\u00a0\nThe judges were impressed with how Gaggar has created an immersive cultural experience that both economically benefits artists and enriches travellers. They called it a \"highly replicable approach\".\nToday, the company offers more than 20 hand-on art experiences in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, with plans to include artists from Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Bundi and Kota in the near future.\nAs this year's protests have been demonstrating, tourism has an impact on local people as much as visitors. Sivatel Bangkok was this year's winner for its innovative approach that brings together local providers to directly help the community.\nThe hotel sources 70% of its ingredients organically and partners with more than 50 local farmers through the Sivatel's Farmer Friends Network. It also supports local producers and fosters a sustainable ecosystem through the \"Sivatel Sustainable Market\", a pop-up market within the hotel where local artisans and food producers can sell their wares to travellers. Uniforms are designed by Folkcharm, a local sustainable fashion brand that supports local artisans.\nPerhaps most uniquely, it runs a \"From Kitchen to Chicken\" programme, diverting hotel food scraps to feed black soldier fly larvae, which are then used as protein for organic chickens at a local chicken farm, where the hotel then sources its meat.\nThe judging panel found Sivatel Bangkok's structured programme based around regenerative agriculture and funding impressive, along with the way it sources and trains local providers.\u00a0\n\"We believe that to live on this Earth, we cannot live alone but must support each other,\" said Sivatel CEO Alisara Sivayathorn.\nWith a business that serves more than six million holidaymakers a year, TUI is one of the best-known tourism brands in Europe. Its deep and comprehensive commitment to inclusivity impressed the judges: the tour operator has devised a unique way to help those with access needs book their accommodations.\nAmong TUI's many initiatives, they have 90 dedicated agents in their contact centre who have had specialist accessibility training; the team has partnered with AccessAble to survey hotels and develop detailed access guides; and also works with Sign Live to provide interpreting services for British Sign Language Users.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n\u2022\u00a0What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n\u2022\u00a0The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\n\"Around one in four of the UK population lives with a disability or condition that impacts their daily life,\" said Marina Snellenberg, TUI's accessibility manager, \"and the prevalence of disability rises sharply with age. It's important that TUI consider the needs and expectations of the disabled community, allowing for a sustained and deliverable customer experience for years to come.\"\u00a0\nJudges were pleased to see a major tour operator address the needs of those with access needs so comprehensively, and hope that others will follow their example.\nThis award celebrates a small hotel group in Sri Lanka that is actively decarbonising its operations, showing that even smaller players can take meaningful steps towards sustainability and inspire others while doing so.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a tropical climate like Sri Lanka, air conditioning can consume up to 60% of a hotel's energy needs. Across its 19 hotels, Jetwing Hotels uses renewable energy from biomass, solar PV, solar thermal and biogas for power. In 2023, the hotel group generated the equivalent of the power needed for about 13,490 households through renewable energy alone. The company has also shortened its supply chain, reducing transport emissions, and is now sourcing 40% of their inputs locally to their hotels.\n\"By reducing energy costs and promoting a culture of environmental responsibility among our staff and guests, we ensure that our business practices are not only beneficial for the environment but also economically viable,\" said managing director Dmitri Cooray, \"Our success shows that even the smallest efforts can create a ripple effect, encouraging others to make impactful changes.\"\nThe award founders believe that the travel industry has a responsibility to contribute to the reversal of biodiversity loss and protect nature for future generations by promoting a regenerative approach to tourism. CREES, a Peruvian company offering tours and volunteering opportunities in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, is this year's winner of the Nature Positive award.\nThis educational tourism operation is working to benefit local people and conserve biodiversity at its three research stations in the Manu National Park that are home to one of the longest running and largest biodiversity studies in the Amazon. Guests get to witness conservation efforts first hand, exploring the rainforest in the company of the centre's naturalist guides, and participating in ongoing projects like checking pitfall traps, monitoring birdlife and taking visual surveys of reptiles and amphibians at night. Many of the projects monitor the life of the forest in newly regenerated forest areas, replanted by the team's conservationists, as a way to understand species recovery.\u00a0\nJudges were particularly impressed by how CREES approaches its work, citing its broad and holistic agenda aimed at promoting sustainable alternatives that respect human rights, intergenerational rights, biodiversity rights and the rights of species to ensure long-term sustainable economic development, as key factors in its win.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.\nA night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How opera can be 'open to everyone'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The nation that is the 'land of song'\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera House cut ties with its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to a UK study conducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work \u2013 and opera houses are no exception.\nThe pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive the Theatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes \u2013 sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations \u2013 spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.\nA key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. \"Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,\" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentary Take Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne. \n\u00a0\nIn 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: \"I know that many opera companies\u2026 don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.\"\nGlyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the global Race to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. \"We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,\" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. \"We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine.\" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. \"Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,\" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. \"This way everything goes back into the ground.\"\nClimate action\nGlyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.\nThe rooftop of the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, for example, is host to an urban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.\nThe Sydney Opera House \u2013 a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 \u2013 has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021, a survey by the UK's Theatres Trust found that it would cost more than \u00a31bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.\nIn the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than \u00a0630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recent New York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting.\nElsewhere, the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon, G\u00f6teborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on a new project investigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first \"green season\", using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new \"eco-entertainment\" work titled Masque of Might.\nAs the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.\nTake Me to the Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne is on BBC News Channel and on BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music \u2013 with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.\nIf asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The radical trend millennials love\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forgotten Soviet genius of music\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?\nThere are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and \u2013 just as vitally \u2013 new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.\nUnsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag \"classictok\" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.\nFor French violinist Esther Abrami \u2013 who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards \u2013 the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. \"I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,\" Abrami tells BBC Culture.\nShe noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. \"I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,\" she enthuses. \"It opened this door to a completely new world.\"\nNigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fan Babatunde Akinboboye enjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. \"I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,\" he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. \"But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,\" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of \"hip-hopera\" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.\nBoth Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. \"I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,\" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts \u2013 taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery \u00a0\u2013 have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. \"It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,\" he explains. \"Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.\"\n'Complex and profound'\nAbrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: \"I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.\"\n\u00a0\nBritish concert pianist Harriet Stubbs is another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple 20-minute concerts from her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. \"I gave 250 concerts,\" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. \"I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.\"\nThe fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. \"I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,\" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a \"Bowie meets Rachmaninoff\" affair.\nInterestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia \u2013 dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery \u2013 both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub J\u00f3zef Orli\u0144ski, meanwhile, uses atmospheric visuals as a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, which The New York Times describes as \"resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos\".\n\"I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums \u2013 the narrative, the photography, the videos,\" Orli\u0144ski tells BBC Culture. \"I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,\" he adds. This is certainly something Orli\u0144ski has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, he wowed critics with his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was \"an incredible experience\" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. \"Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul \u2013 a pop song won't work.\"\nClassical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK's National Youth Orchestra have just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of \"the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager\".\nOrli\u0144ski agrees that classical music has achieved an \"almost hipstery\" status of late. \"It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,\" he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as \"people like Yuja Wang\" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. \"We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward.\" Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. \"I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,\" he concludes. \"[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing. And it'll work out, because audiences are ready.\"\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

        "article_text": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier.\nBeware of green. It can\u2019t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment\u2019s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, \u201cvanishes into thin air\u201d. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso\u2019s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet.\nMore like this: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The insect that painted Europe red\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nTo dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green\u2019s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour \u2013 one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history.\nDonning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. \u201cLike the vampire,\u201d the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, \u201cshe has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave\u201d. Describing Leonardo\u2019s inscrutable sitter as \u201colder than the rocks among which she sits\u201d, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from \u201ca diver in deep seas\u201d to a savvy operator who has woven \u201cstrange webs with Eastern merchants\u201d. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant\u2019s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was \u201cthe mother of Helen of Troy\u201d and the \u201cmother Mary\u201d.\nLong before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris \u2013 ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh\u2019s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence.\nPerennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt\u2019s kings the path to resurrection.\nFlora and fauna\nFor millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the \u2018The Asp of Jerusalem\u2019. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade.\nAn acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he\u2019d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe\u2019s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012.\nFertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini\u2019s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy\u2019s bump in Jan van Eyck\u2019s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn\u2019t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal.\nAn alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green\u2019s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck\u2019s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao \u2013 his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple\u2019s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it\u2019s green.\nSo green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable\u2019s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting \u2013 a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured.\nThough rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour\u2019s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one\u2019s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation.\nHiding in plain sight\nIn more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin\u2019s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour\u2019s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue \u2013 as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond.\nBelgian surrealist painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist\u2019s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. \u201cEverything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,\u201d Magritte observed to an interviewer. \u201cThere is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.\u201d\nNo contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully\u2019s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse\u2019s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully\u2019s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer\u2019s space, the ficus greens of Scully\u2019s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u2013 and which allows art to swivel between different states of being.\nExpunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton\u2019s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It\u2019s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being \u2013 this world and another, life and death.\nOutside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming\u00a0into a\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European\u00a0royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual\u00a0coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange),\u00a0quickly embraced the linguistic\u00a0coincidence in the 1570s. His\u00a0orange-white-and-blue\u00a0rebel flag would become\u00a0the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion\u00a0of everything from Swiss fire\u00a0engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it\u2019s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully.\nFrom antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth\u2019s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire.\nConvinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latin aurum, meaning \u2018gold\u2019, and pigmentum meaning \u2018colour\u2019) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure.\nA spark to a flame\nIntentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet\u2019s plush orange jacket \u2013 its vibrant rumples flickering like flares \u2013 threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer\u2019s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work\u2019s flustering power would be utterly lost.\nNor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard\u2019s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don\u2019t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange \u2013 not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire.\nAnd so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we\u2019ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel. How else can you characterise the realm in which the liquified face of Munch\u2019s hero howls under a strange and estranging burnt-cinnamon sky in The Scream? How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse\u2019s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion?\nCommissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch\u2019s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other\u2019s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground. Her left foot is already sliding out of view. Far from depicting untroubled joy, Matisse\u2019s carefully choreographed masterpiece teeters on cosmic disaster. The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt.\nAmber alert\nMunch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte\u2019s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like orange\u201d. Like it or not, orange is frequently the heat that holds together \u2013 while threatening to break apart \u2013 the visual music of her sinuous mosaics.\nAs crucial as orange has been to the story of art through the end of the last century, it has already dyed itself indelibly into the unfolding fabric of contemporary artistic consciousness. Among the most celebrated major works of the new millennium, The Gates, by Bulgarian artist Christo Yavacheff and French artist Jeanne-Claude (known together as Christo and Jeanne-Claude), colonised New York City\u2019s Central Park in February 2005 with over 7,500 passageways \u2013 each flowing with orange nylon fabric. The lyrical succession of thresholds, which fostered a poetic sense of the endless comings and goings of life \u2013 birth and rebirth, mortality and eternity \u2013 could, on reflection, have only been draped in stirring saffron. To some, the colour echoes the robes of Buddhist monks. But to my mind, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who passed away four years later) were rekindling a sacred flame, inviting those who would come to bask their weary souls in the transformative power of that most mystical of ancient tints: orange.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

        "article_text": "Marcel Duchamp\u2019s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart \u2013 and at its 17th-Century predecessor.\nThis year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history \u2013 a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.\nMore like this:\n- When the Parthenon had dazzling colours\n- The insect that painted Europe red\n- The subversive power of the pipe\nThe work in question is awkwardly proportioned \u2013 over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall \u2013 and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um\u2019, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m\u2019ennuies, or \u2018you bore me\u2019) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making \u2013 found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel \u2013 that he christened \u2018readymades\u2019.\nIn stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, \u201cDuchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.\u201d Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.\nAnyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these \u2018readymade\u2019 swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp\u2019s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp\u2019s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp\u2019s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept \u2013 a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity \u2013 a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard \u2013 one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues \u2013 a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades \u2013 a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp\u2019s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of \u2018A. Boogert\u2019 \u2013 a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert\u2019s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel\u2019s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author\u2019s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp\u2019s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert\u2019s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp\u2019s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life\u2019s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
